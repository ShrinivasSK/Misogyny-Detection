5911,5912,"@navya patil you are talking about whom then you are referring to men or
women. you are talking about human beings then who are human beings there are
two genders in human beings male and female like that in other species too. if
any person keep false allegations on a person who is innocent that person
becomes the enemy of the humanity.  
look. according to me there are two genders males and females that's it i
don't give a damn about third gender. i am anti lgbt person who will oppose
them because i feel they are huge threat to humanity all women and men will
suffer if they get corrupted.  
according to me feminist is about the rights of girls that it not about men at
all. all i care about humanity,nature,wildlife and animals that's it. always
fighting for equality for education is fine,jobs fine if you have potential to
take care of the pressure no problem go ahead, but if you don't want to change
initial after marriage that is not acceptable you should always be called of
your husband name or his initial which i don't agree if anyone oppose that  
asking for father share of property ok no problem. but if men can marry
multiple women doesn't mean women can marry i will always be against the idea
. fighting for rights in everything is not acceptable. equality in good things
is ok i have full support but not in bad things also. always don't imitate men
for everything. few things ok. always crying over men that women are not
getting justice saying this is wrong.  
if you have potential to take care of both career and family equally then no
problem go ahead. if you are not able to balance both then forget about job.
just take care of children because children can be raise properly by women
more than men. if you want to get divorce though your husband not done
anything wrong then forget about asking money from him. if you are earning
money good then you have no right to ask money from your husband if you are
getting divorced.  
i am not feminist at all i agree women should fight for equality for few
things not everything. if men can do why can't we do. now men are drinking and
smoking try to stop them and don't become like them. if men are bribing try to
stop them don't do the same thing. if men are going for casino try to stop
them not do the same thing. if men are using drugs stop them not doing the
same thing etc.",0

5478,5479,"It's absurdly popular because the bar for isekai is so low that Rising of the Shield Hero being just okay makes it exception and Raphtalia is the cutest reverse-loli to exist. Isekai is so steeped in the same cliches, over and over, that it felt *ground breaking* to have the protagonist NOT be beloved by every single character he meets and have to endure a *bad reputation*. I'm not condemning it for not being deep, it's a satisfying popcorn story with some good hooks. I only read the manga and couldn't get far into the anime but when I read it, yeah that shit was engaging. 

That  protagonist gets falsely accused of rape is so controversial because *people can't stand the thought of men being victims or women being villains* is what really blows my mind. Total Duluth Model of kool-aid drinking.

I could be wrong but I thought this was standard in Japan? There's no gatekeeping with editors or literary agents so the internet is basically flooded with original fanfics with people voting on what they like. This makes it very easy for authors to copy one another, which is why ever since Sword Art Online blew up isekai has not only become popular but each isekai story is super derivative and formulaic when you compare them to each other. Sure there are a few exceptions but for the most part you can tell exactly what the author had already read/watched when they made their own isekai. The market has become so flooded online that people have started getting *really* creative with their story titles because something as Moonlight Breakfast doesn't quite grab the reader's attention as much as Who In Their Right Mind Would Make Toast With Their Butt. So what happens is officials take a look at what LNs online are popular, the LN gets a real book deal and published in meat space while an anime is adapted asap to cash in on its popularity. The market has also become so flooded that over the past few years they've started to pull away from ""teenage male protagonist"" stories so authors started developing new gimmicks such as reincarnation.",0

In any case, the previous commenter makes a good case for vetting. I think Athol Kay (former RP blogger for men) wrote that a man's goal when picking a wife should be having the happiest family life possible, not marrying into problems and trying to rescue a woman. I'd say this applies to women as well.

Obviously, vetting isn't perfect...people change, you may not really know what a person is really like until a crisis hits post-marriage (job loss, serious illness, pandemic, heh).

3623,3624,"The impact of a man's past on him is very different from the impact of a woman's past on her - and the difference can be day and night when the man has the tools to deal with his past.**TL : DR - What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger, once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman damages and enslaves her for life, with recovery a rare exception.**

**We're specifically talking about past experiences here.**

As tomes of RP posts and reports coming from direct experience would have told you by know, a woman's past does matter a lot. Even a guy like Roosh who had sex with hundreds of women when he retired admitted he'd only want women with zero or low n counts. A man who is sexually very successful is seen as extra attractive despite his reputation while a woman who is too loose is slut shamed or considered washed up especially after she's spent her prime years riding the CC. On Tinder it couldn't be more blatant that 80-90% of the women want to fuck the top 10% of men. A man who fails sexually is an object of ridicule by both women and other men while a woman who saves her body for the best man / men is appreciated for her taste. Instinctively our standards for men and women are opposites. 

While a feminine dominant society tries to shame men for taking her past into consideration, and shames men for the expectation of wanting either virgins or women with a low n count, while simultaneously encouraging her to be ""sexually liberated"", make ""her choice"" and on top of that later down the road, tries to convince a man that she has ""matured"" or is ""over it"" or ""now knows what she wants"" (lol the irony), we observe the actual scenario and know far better what's really up. Of course, there is always a set of women especially in more conservative countries who are 1-2 generations behind the current state of the West to try to play the ""I want a virgin too or a good man with a low n count card"" in the name of ""equal logic and equal standards"".

Whatever the strategy used by different societies, discussions of one's past bring up fierce debates on unfairness and equality. However life doesn't run on machine logic.

A man's past is a problem for him when it injures him deeply - either physically, or emotionally or mentally, and when he has neither the tools nor the awareness nor the frame to deal with it. If he doesn't find the tools, the results can be catastrophic. One only needs to look at what kind of shit men can land up into - violent crime, abusive relationships, suicides, drugs, alcohol -- and every one of this is due to past trauma that never found space and consciousness to heal.

To add to the challenge, men often do not have support systems, those whom he needs in his low moments ditch him for the good times and he is ridiculed for trying to seek help. Man is ridiculed for even saying he has a problem. Even in effective support systems meant to help him, he has to face at least 50 people all calling him a faggot for every mistake and has to earn his respect (MRP, I'm looking at you...and respect you). A man learns soon that there is no substitute for strength and being proactive.

Let's make the exception for lasting physical trauma. Soldiers who come back with PTSD and worse from wars have often been found to have suffered lasting brain injuries and lesions, which are responsible for the symptoms. Some people with an altered personality have been known to have had a brain tumor in a particular part of their brain. So, physical damage is the one thing a man might totally not recover from. But that hasn't stopped them from trying.

But when a man does have the tools and cultivates some awareness and frame, the mental and emotional scars can soon be overcome, and except severe injuries that caused permanent damage to the body, many injuries and diseases can also be fixed medically today. Everyone who has ever contributed to RP awareness has shared their own tools from their toolbox for this purpose (for those who ask). I too found some really powerful tools for me, which I have shared.

Once a man has somehow found the space he needs to make even a little peace with his past, his problem solving mind gets to work, learning lessons from the experience, developing a new mindset and approach, looking at what went wrong and how to improve his results. Recognizing that there is no support granted to him, but the need must still be addressed nevertheless, a man decides to create what is missing in life himself, walking the hard path. It is a long an arduous road to create what has not existed before.

If needed, man seeks out discomfort in planned doses, gains additional experiences, works on himself and gets better and better every time with each additional experience, every failure and success until he masters the challenges that once seemed impossible to him. As every rep he does stimulates more muscle to grow afterward, men simply improve with experience. Men use their past to attain mastery in the present. Man essentially runs on the paradigm **""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger""**. Of course let's be practical and add this line - **""Once he recovers from it. ""**

This is also and especially true for sex. A man who has embraced his sexuality gets better at the game with every experience.

A man once awakened, doesn't mind systematically annihilating his past dysfunctional self to become a more evolved being.

A bad past however has a much worse impact on a woman, given her much greater sensitivity. It creates a self perpetuating trauma pattern in her that keeps her locked in it. If her past was abusive, expect her to have a much greater tendency to pair up with the abusive assholes and suffer all her life, even if it means her children suffer at times. 10 minutes of sex god and she is alpha widowed for life and can't enjoy sex that way with other men again. 10 years of riding the cock carousel before settling down with a nice provider means it's only a matter of time before she gets bored with marriage and aspires for the thrill of the chase again  -- once unstable relationships, always unstable relationships. Or if she gets violated against her will, she can feel horrible, ashamed, dirty, even defiled and this can make it impossible for her to let go and enjoy herself with a future lover. There is no end to those complications and all the forms past unresolved emotions can take. 

**In matters involving any significant intensity of emotion, a woman essentially becomes the victim of her past pleasure and pain.**

Bitter experiences can force women to wear the pants, man up and step up to the challenges, especially if her mama mode is activated. But these usually leave her still scarred bitterly at the emotional level. A woman who has to wear the pants in the house invariably develops contempt for the man who doesn't. Behind every feminist champion, you can always find a woman emotionally scarred to some degree or the other.  Tough women especially carry boat loads of unresolved emotional pain. There are many such women who have manned up only to lose faith in men and carry bitterness and contempt towards men for not having the manliness that a woman was capable of summoning. 

Unresolved past sexual trauma can subconsciously force a woman to make herself unattractive and unhealthy, which is what we see in many feminists, as a way to avoid the possibility of a repeat of that experience and getting hurt again. By comparison, men who are hurt try to avoid relationships. 

The tendency of the feminine ego to seek refuge in the feeling of victim hood does not help in this - it helps keep her past alive in her. A bad past just gives the victim tendency a first class ticket.

The fact that women tend to be a herd animal with a significant collective hive mind component to their existence makes it worse. In one room, all that one woman has to do is to bring out her past emotions and you can be sure that within minutes, even seconds, that all the women are feeling the same thing. The impact of past experiences on a woman is simply deeper and bigger already due to their sensitive nature, and it only gets multiplied further by the collective pain body of the feminine.

We even see this any time she's in a bad mood -- they remember past miseries and mistakes in excruciating detail don't they? Not all of a woman's pain or emotion is hers alone, it's the pain and emotion of womankind.

Let's not even get started on bad habits. Women who get into drinking and drug abuse wreck their lives and the lives of their families and children in spectacularly horrible ways. And once it starts it becomes near impossible for them to stop. I see a lot of men in mrp in the OYS threads working on their addictions from alcohol to the smartphone and porn, but I don't get to see many woman come out of deep shit by themselves. They'll need help, if they are capable of being helped at that point that is.

While a man can get to enjoy the feeling of mastery at the end of his struggles and suffering and victory, a woman is still left with a bitter taste in her psyche and lots of unresolved pain even if she ends up succeeding. Even success doesn't seem to fill up a woman's emotional holes - you can see this with any successful woman who had to wear the pants to get there. There is some unhappiness in their tone, as though they regret the impact it had on their femininity. 

As for a history of crazy sexual behaviour, when I see the stories of many of these women, with notch counts that would have been impossible without contraception, their troubling past prior to that, along all the thoughts and emotions that these women admit to having over time swinging across the entire spectrum, and add the impact of powerful sexual memory on their system, all I can say is that it's a case of absolutely fucked up, both inside and out. The fuck up outside just reflects the fuck up on the inside, and makes it worse. The biggest mistake is to assume and believe what they say as if the impact of such powerful emotions and experiences can simply be wished away by rationalization. 

A lifetime spent running full throttle in one direction will never magically fix itself overnight. 

As I wrote in my post on the irony of ""Choice"", it is stupid to think you are choosing when your mind has this much grip over you. These women may claim they are over it, but deep down their minds are still in the same deep turmoil of thoughts and emotions as ever and they have never addressed that. That software runs freely on the inside, just hidden. That won't stay quiet for long. Sooner or later their unhappy selves are going to emerge for the next round of seeking salvation elsewhere, or they are going to go crazy. 

And that's why you should never listen to their claims that they've overcome their past. That as you will read below, requires exceptional work, the honesty to face oneself and take responsibility for once, and they should have clearly done it and have results to show for it. You cannot practice instability all your life and then hope to stay stable and committed one fine day. How in the world did men start believing that shit and even white knighting for it by any logic is beyond me.

So for all but the most spiritual of women, a woman essentially runs on the paradigm of being a victim of her past -- **""What doesn't kill her enslaves her"". Recovery? Oh God...**

Why I said all but the most spiritual women was that there are some women who do find tools to work on themselves, a few do end up recovering from their past experiences, but if you've ever read some of the books written by them on the subject, you can tell that the recovery process is a battle, involving massive emotional releases, moments of very altered moods and the like - it's like 4th of July. The key difficulty is that women being more emotional, find the way of awareness and inner peace inherently more difficult, and have a lot of extra pain to resolve. Usually devotion, service, nurturing others and emotional methods work much easier with them (which is why more women than men go seek religion). But it is not impossible, and the tools can also work extremely well with them.

In fact most of the tools will work on anyone who is serious about using them.

Trouble is, many of these women are too deep into the grip of their own past patterns to get to the start line even. It takes women years of work to get to a point where a lot of their traumatic patterns are dissolved and we're back on a clean slate, though by then, they might not even be physically in their prime. Biologically women have a shorter prime than men to bear healthy children and then be healthy enough to raise them to adulthood. Men on the other hand, can keep their physical and reproductive prime up for longer.

The task of ""annihilating their past unhappy self"" is therefore much harder for a woman and needs more work. A man would find it easier to help himself or recruit help where he doesn't find help by default, but women really do need far more hand holding when dealing with deep inner pain. Sometimes absolute dominance is probably the only way to force them to start to work on themselves.

Biologically a woman who has a bad past or a history of bad habits, or even a very stressed history has a much greater chance of hurting the physical and mental health of an unborn child. In old school societies, lots of care is taken to see to it that pregnant women are kept emotionally ""well fed"". Just a history of lots of stresses, irregular hours of food, diet and rest can damage their fertility and reproductive health. No one mentions the impact of abortions and contraception on reproductive health and hormonal balance. A woman's body is a significant biological investment, and men are biologically wired to be repelled by women with a history of destructive habits and behavior.

Do keep in mind though that a man's bad habits like smoking and drinking and sedentary living also damage his reproductive health and T levels, but again, good habits, lifting and diet can go a long long way to correcting this. Fitness also has equally positive effects on a woman's health, but most unhealthy women I tell you also come with a significant degree of mental and emotional illness and are too far in a hell hole to even turn up at the gym. **Most women who are unhealthy today are actually so because of an underlying emotional or mental problem, while most men are just plain lazy**. In my world, women will have to lift, do yogic practices and meditate. For their own good. I won't accept those not willing.

Amidst all this, anything a woman gains in technical skill from her sexual experiences can easily become irrelevant. Besides, a skilled man can always train a willing woman (go to mrp and see that latest post), leaving her free to concentrate on the seduction part of her game.

I honestly feel sadness and pity for many of these women whom I see, broken wrecks of what could have been. I couldn't stay cold about it if it happened to any of the women in my family or life, but honestly, they're doing it to themselves and save-a-hoe is just stupid -- the foolish nice guy who wants to save them and change them just gets swept into that shit and realizes too late that this is way beyond his power to solve, and he might not even be able to get out safely from crazy. 

In the case of woman and the impact of her past on her psyche, prevention was always far better than cure. Let's be real about that. That's why old societies were always so strict with their women. 

So in the end, a man's past can end up making him stronger and wiser and he can look back at it honestly without toxic shame, with a degree of pride and gratitude even -- as a very harsh teacher, but the one he needed, that taught him permanent lessons. Women on the other hand, are often left with permanent or lasting physical and psychological damage from their pasts far more than lessons learned. Men become responsible for themselves over their past, women become victims of their past.

**And that's why a man's past and a woman's past are simply not comparable.** We're not denying that men too get damaged from their past, but unless its a serious physical injury, it is indeed easier to recover from that and emerge stronger than it is for a woman. What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman tortures her for the rest of her life. And that is how it goes for all but the most exceptional cases.

*PS : When I used the word ""past"", it wasn't in the context of reputation, but past experiences. Now about reputation -- A woman's reputation did matter enormously in societies of the past, and I myself know that my grandmother would have preferred death to shame and loss of reputation. But in a feminine primary society, the sisterhood will defend her in public, encourage her in private and bitch about her behind her back. Yes, that last part is true.*

*A man's reputation however is everything, especially in this kind of society. It is more vulnerable than the most delicate and sensitive woman, and as easy to shatter as glass, and easier to damage forever. A woman will cast allegations on you, even and especially false ones if it benefits her, her sisters will vilify you as a monster, your rival men, her orbiters, and envious betas will rush to her aid, glad to see your downfall, the white knights and SJWs will attack you, and the justice system exists for the sole purpose of screwing you forever, you'll be abused and raped in prison hell, you're out of the job market, the feminist dominated media will write any shit on you if it sells, society treats you in ways they didn't treat slaves or untouchables, and your best hope is to actually STFU and fight to the end --* ***rape of a man is the rape of his reputation and freedom.*** *Once raped, it will never recover to the way it was formerly.* *Only God alone can save you if truth is on your side TBH. So remember Law #5 always --* ***So much depends on reputation, guard it with your life!***",0

liberal is not true

anything. So i dont expect you to tell me what to wear.

start questioning vedas you will find it just a book written by prosperous
people to control the entire community. How can u relate Mathematics with
vedas? Pls dont tell me calculus was invented by vedas.

3396,3397,"A marriage to a good man won't work if you aren't attracted to him. It won't feel good for you. If you're mentally unhealthy, good men might not always be attractive to you. I notice a lot of young women who call themselves ""alpha widowed"" tend to bring up later that they have mental health issues too.

Some reasons good men might not catch your eye...

-You might have ""intimacy fears"" that stop you from genuinely connecting with people in a healthy way. 

-You might have low self esteem issues that cause you to accept the love you think you deserve (unfulfilling) rather than the love you desire (fulfilling).

-You might have an ""attachment style"" that creates bad dynamics. 

-You grew up in an unhealthy environment and haven't resolved issues from childhood. Often we can confuse what feels familiar with what is attractive. Until you address your issues so that your body registers that familiarity as a red flag, this can make balanced and healthy people unappetizing. 

If any of this sounds familiar, therapy can be a huge help.

If none of this sounds relevant, perhaps your criteria are too stringent on things that don't matter and perhaps lax on ones that do. ""Marry Him"" by Lori Gotttlieb is a solid book if you're worried you're in this camp.",0

So yesterday, I went to a shopping mall, did some shopping and went out to another store to make an account payment. Whilst there, I was spoke to the girl who was assisting and at some point we had a moment of banter and I was like okay, maybe I should ask her out. 

Once I did the payment, I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and I got a no. From there I said, its ok, I understand. Weirdly enough, I felt good and I was okay with her choice. Her rejecting me didnt make me any less of a man. 

My mental critic tried to spin it off to say she rejected you because of your horrible crooked teeth (Im getting braces next month) and your horrible face but all I knew was, I was getting somewhere and being rejected doesnt make me any less of a man.

3591,3592,"Thanky you for your reponse. Yes I reject the idea of toxic mascullinity. What you are describing I would attribute to Gynocentrism and also male disposability/ the gender empathy gap as the videos show. See the video below for toxic feminitiy - and YES it does lead to death and violence. I dont think toxic femininity should be gendered. Funnily enough, the few feminist who have agreed that toxic feminity exists again do not call it this, they blame it on the patriacrhy and at times call it internalised mysogony. If feminism continues to use such deregatory and bigoted terms such as toxic msaculinity, mansplaining, manterupting, etc then Karen, toxic feminity etc will inevitably also result, and we dont want either of these, yet currently we have it one way. Id rather not see the rise of the term femsplaining and FEMIslplaining (where feminists explain to men their lived experiences)

The is it 2 because some take men is irrelvant. It is still vastly different whether 2 vs 2000 or not

(some, but sadly mainstream and the ones that actually matter) feminists, sadly are not ahead as you state, they have precisely created those gendered laws and issues in the first place:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkhq13TVRGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkhq13TVRGc)

This is why it is very good that western feminists are not tackling issues in India or Saudia etc. (they wont anyway as it wil cause more probems for them, apart from say it is bad, but that is another debate) Anyway:

""There  are many ways that sexism harms women in india, there are also many  ways that the same sexism benifits women. There are also many ways in  which sexism specifically harms men, and in many ways that that same  sexism benifits them. To fix the issues in places like india, we need an  egilatrian approach, or we dont need a name for it just a global  approach that solves issues of both genders and not one way.... For  example in Saudia Arabia, it is not fair to allow women the right to  work but still keep the rule that womens personal income is solely for  her, and that a man is legally obliged to provide for her as well as the  social pressure to do so also. Also women cannot not keep the rule  where their money is solely theirs and not their husbands, and then  still expect larger inheritances. That kind of change is what (most)  feminists would do if they got involved (western ones wont anyway apart  from to talk about it), as they would only focus on womens issues such  as right to work, yet ignore obligation to be guaranteed finanicially  looked after. I am not speculating, similar things happened right from  1st wave feminism (and \[some\] feminists did this on purpose e.g. took  property that they acquired the legal right to but the MEN still had the  responsiblity of the tax for, and some men went to jail for not being  able to afford their wifes property, which they would still keep and  would not sell)""",0

He made a few points about how, when you learn something that might make you look bad, your immediate impulse might be to reject it. For example, someone saying ""I can't eat that because I'm vegan"" might make you feel judged so you will react negatively. Even if the vegan doesn't care what you eat, you might feel like their actions present an idea that, if true, could mean that you have been doing something bad for most of your life: eating meat is bad. This makes you feel guilty and judged so you reject the idea and mock the vegan. 

This is explained much better in Innuendo Studio's [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU&list=PLJA_jUddXvY62dhVThbeegLPpvQlR4CjF&index=3&t=0s) but that's the general idea. The video is part 2/6, so sorry if it doesn't make sense without the context of part 1.

5963,5964,"Something that helped me gain confidence.So, I know a lot of guys(including me) lacked confidence. I lacked confidence almost my entire life, I was not awkward but I still felt like I needed more confidence. One thing that helped me gain A LOT of confidence is this:
One night I was extremely bored and thought I might download Tinder, so I did that and I upgraded to gold version. I changed my locations often to many different countries, I also downloaded some apps where you can talk to strangers online. I downloaded an app where you connect with snapchat and you can match with girls and talk to snapchat.
How did this help me?
Well I got some matches and started chatting with some girls from Poland, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, anyway the countries doesnt matter. I felt an immediate ego boost, to see that women from all around the world would want to talk to me. What matters is this, you are attractive, some girls will find you attractive, some wont. What you need to remember is that you are attractive! Anyways when I did this I noticed that I was talking to 10 or more girls that I probably wont ever meet in real life. I wasnt worried that I might say something wrong to drive them away from me, because they are so far away from me that I wont see them in real life. I just had fun and had interesting conversations. The thing is when I started talking to girls with whom I could actually meet up with I wasnt asking myself questions like Did I text her early, did I text her late, did I say something wrong? I just went with the flow and talked to them, I KNEW that I was attractive, I knew that women wanted to have conversations with me. What I got from my experience is that some women will like you and some wont and guess what, thats fine!! If you keep doing this, talking to girls from all around the world, I promise you will improve your confidence and conversation skills!

So to summarize: download many online chatting and dating apps, meet women from all around the world, talk to them, you will see that when you talk to women from far away and when you talk to those women that you can actually meet up that there isnt a difference, you will gain confidence, you will improve your conversation skills, you will improve your text game!

Anyways just wanted to share what helped me, if you want to know which apps I used just PM me and I will tell you! Remember guys, you are attractive!!",0

Also, why did you ask on that sub specifically?

And lastly, again: Why *that* sub? Why are you asking the radical part of a group to define the group for you?

**Breaking Free Activity 7:** can people see my imperfections and still love me? How would I be different if I knew the people I care about would never leave/stop loving me? 

* On an intellectual level yes but it doesnt feel that way. What else is there to love other than how I give to them and if I have imperfections then I am giving less. The bit about people being attracted to another persons life energy resonated with me, I used to have that but I seem to have lost it to a large degree. The work Im doing here is bringing it back. 
* I would say what I thought, I would express myself authentically, I would not consider how they would react before speaking. I wouldnt pass everything through the will it piss them off filter, I would not try and prove how useful I am, I would just act in line with my authentic self rather than towards getting a specific action from them. 

**Breaking Free Activity 8:** Validating behavior to stop/increase. 

* Im not in a relationship so that eliminated a lot of my normal validation seeking behavior. I picked seeking validation from women on apps as this is something I was working on anyway. I am cutting that out. 
* When I was doing it more, I felt distracted and like I was always chasing something. I was living outside myself and I felt pulled in all different directions. This was because I was responding to something external without any internal sense of direction. My whole being was reacting to the whims of how some random women reacted towards me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 9:** Something I wanted to do for myself. 

Struggled with this one, I have a lot of hang-ups about what I want to do. Being selfish seems a terrible thing to be. There are a bunch of sex things but Im worried that is validation at this point, do I want to fuck a 19 year old for validation or because I just want to? Probably both. 

* Get a nice car
* Get tailored suite + shirts 
* Fuck a 19 year old
* Rally driving course 
* Beach resort holiday 
* Allow myself to be what I am
* Camping on beach for a month 

Need to revisit this activity at some point, this list is pretty lame. 

**Breaking Free Activity 10:** affirmations.

The ones that work for me are listed below. I say these before bed during my 10min med. 

* I am lovable just as I am
* My needs matter
* I do not break
* I am my own judge  
* I am consistently improving myself and my life
* I am deeply connected to all things in life
* I let fear pass through me
* I focus and apply myself towards my goals 
* I like and respect myself 

**Breaking Free Activity 11: Go on a retreat alone.** 

During lockdown this is not viable. Having said that, I regularly spend time alone, camping alone etc and this is some of the most stress free and enjoyable time for me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 12**: Do you believe its ok to have needs? Do you belief people want to help you meet your needs? Do you believe this world is a place of abundance? 

* No to all three questions. 
* I remember hiding myself away as a kid and feeling embarrassed of needing anything emotionally. At the same time, I dont want to become more needy. Im not sure how to balance these two, I need to understand how to be self-reliant and not needy but at the same time recognize and act on my needs. 
* Re people meeting your needs, Im not sure what I think, really at the end of the day it is an exchange of value. If they get what they want from you they will give in return. 
* I think fear is at the root of my scarcity. I close up to the world to protect myself and so the world is closed to me. When I was a kid, there was money scarcity, I was given messages that having nice things (like a nice car) was selfish, when I was a teen/early 20s there was women scarcity (and money scarcity!) and now I have a general scarcity attitude. I am starting to open up from this, seeing there are plenty of women, friends and opportunities in life. Im still not there on the money.",0

6245,6246,"I asked my husband and he would be absolutely fine with it. However, we both find breastfeeding important. I have fed the oldest for almost 2 years now and the youngest for 8 months, and am planning to continue for at least another year. So wed both want for me to wait until I have birthed and fed all the children we might have. 

A question I was wondering about, and I hope this doesnt come across as rude: does any of it have to do with weight? I had a friend with very large breasts who was considering a reduction, but was also on the heavy side. She lost 3 cup sizes when she lost about 10kg, and looks so much better in proportion now. Because she also did a lot of strength training during her weight loss journey, she no longer has any back or shoulder pain. If this doesnt apply to you, then I would think a reduction would be the only solution.",0

Sex should be something built on trust, honesty, intimacy and love. 

How can you create such an environment without telling her the truth? You cant't! If you tell her, it will create closeness and she will understand why you act inexperienced and she will be able to ""help"" you (e.g. show you how a certain position works) and answer all your questions ... and she will not expect the sex of an experienced guy ... 
You will enjoy the sex more if you don't have to hide your inside ...
Also, you will get used to really open up to your partner and that is the base of every really good relationship ... 

Maybe she will reject you, but rejection is a natural part of life and will always happen no matter what you do ...

I have found civil rights leaders from all sorts of movements but especially anti-racist and anti-colonialist movements super inspiring. Womanists, the largely black PoC women who led the intersectional movement, guided my growth and understanding of how to act right, and all errors I make are my own. 

I found treating the women that grew up rooted in sexism with respect paid dividends. Women have always found ways to live around sexism, whether they acknowledged it or not. Even the most hide-bound culture has ways for people to let off steam. It may not be worth preserving, necessarily, but it is worth understanding.

You may find that you are the person best placed to write or speak about feminism in your home country, or intersectionality in your adopted country. But you dont have to do anything, and you are not alone, not ever. Even if there are few out and out feminists in your home country, there are surely more women who are sympathetic to it; native feminists in your adoptive country may not understand directly, but if theyre half decent and your friends theyll set themselves to understanding. 

Some groups I think you might have luck feeling at home with are 1) other women who have migrated from your home to your adopted country; 2) feminists from countries neighbouring or similar to your home country; 3) groups of immigrant feminists, without specific countries of origin, because some experiences are common.

3699,3700,"Yeah but here's the thing. For $120 I can buy myself 13 stretch cotton-poly plain tees from Walmart, which look and feel nice. If it starts to feel or smell gross I can just change into another one, and I can do that up to 13 times in a day (unlikely but still) before I lose the benefit of buying cheaper. Plus I can just put them in the wash without thinking.

My opinion is that high end tees really only have two purposes:

1. Ultra premium high thread count fabric means you're looking really fly at an event.
2. You're camping/hiking and so the properties of wool become a huge benefit.

Notice how neither of those purposes include everyday use. Tees are thin, and also you wear them every day. That's a recipe for disaster that's going to end up with holes, stains, rips, etc. Which are you more comfortable trashing because of this? A $120 shirt, or a $9 shirt?",0

The other day a friend of mine got some eggs frozen because she was going to have to go through Chemo and most likely become infertile.  

The process to due so is for lack of a better word intense and actually not without risk.  And the chance of them being viable isnt even super high. 

This got me thinking. 

Freezing storing sperm is easy well researched and often has a high success rate.

It not the case for females and maybe the reason is actually the process.   

It can take up too two weeks, you can be unable to do normal activity for up to a week after wards and that is all with no complications. 

My question was knowing that the amount of research put into freezing eggs is rather low compared to the research into freezing sperm [i mean compare the process and just how hard getting samples would be.  With eggs being so much harder to obtain less people donate to science plus you get much less at once per person] should instead of focusing on using the current method, should more research money be spent on a safer way to induce ovulation and for removal instead of focusing so much on raising the egg survival rate? 

Edit: sorry if this is a confusing mess I am not the best at writing out what I am thinking.

The question is in short: due to the risky nature of the current process to indue ovulation for freezing eggs, would it make more sense to spend the research money on a safer way to induce ovulation instead of just on how to raise the success/survival rate of frozen eggs since a safer [and hopefully much cheaper] process would make it more accessible to more woman.  And more accessibility would equal more control over when and were you want kids and the ability too still have them later in life.

4880,4881,"This is a huge milestone.   It has rightfully made the criteria for what's considered sexual assault considerably higher.  There are over 600 lawsuits regarding these gross violations for the accused.

As you can see the vast majority are men and they've seen some success in the courts to remedy their right to due process violations.  So much injustice has occurred for the sake of addressing sexual assault on campuses.  Unfortunately from reading a few cases these men still face an uphill battle in proving gender bias of these ""kangaroo courts"" in court, especially in instances where the committee convinces the accuser that he/she was sexually assaulted when he/she was unsure.",0

3584,3585,"1 in 4 men experience rape/ violence and/or stalking by an intimate patner - yet there are 2 mens shelters in US compared to 2000+ for women. Abuse is an awful crime and we must take a more fair approach when deciding how we offer resources to victims.This is not to downplay any abuse suffered by women. And there are myriad platforms this is discussed in. My personal take is not to gender this issue and to deal with violence in general (yes we accept there are gender differences, in this case actually a lot so we act differently AS APPROPRIATE and ONLY WHERE NEEDED but we tackle the issue AS A WHOLE from the outset, using gendered laws and terms only when there is a good reason). However, this is not a commonly held view. For some dare I say almost all feminists, this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women. **This is not a ""feeling"" or a sentiment that you can deny by simply saying ""i don't so its not true, feminists do support men""** \- it is a cold hard fact, 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women as a result of where they have focused their attention in reality, biased policies and campaigns only focusing on women; multiple specific gendered domestic violence acts and laws yet always and exclsively for women alone.

The soloution: either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it with cold hard ACTUAL change/ lobbying/ campagning/ funding/ (not just ""yeah men can be victims too we care"") OR they need to allow MRA's to approach the issue without the constanst blocking/ banning/ no platforming MRAs who do receive. Even the sheer outrage when we mention statistics.  ***Legendary feminist ERIN PIZZEY opened the first battered shelter for women in the world. When she attempted to do so for men, many years later she received death threats and rape threats by other feminists. Domestic violence, was raised in the mens conference at the university of Cambridge. This event was savagely no platformed/ protested and by (some) feminists and they even played bells to stop the speakers from being heard.***

1. Other points, is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states such as ""male assualts female"" which is a specific offence in some US states and commonwealth countries. Entirely uncessary, as it is covered under normal gender neutral law, and it makes no sesne why there should not be a ""female assualts male"" law or female assualts child and so on.
2. In countries such as Australia there are no mandatory courses abusers who are women who are domestic abusers on avoidin violence, yet there are for men against women. This is one of countless over sights and gendered centric approaches, that currently taget one gender only.
3. Either gender neutral violence acts (that of course leave room for even significantly different approaches to the genders, as it is very different) or specific acts that cover mens abuse, as there will be differences.
4. The law needs rapidly gender neutralisisng and services refocused so we avoid regular occurences were male victims who call the police are being arrested or leaving the home!

&#x200B;

So just a funny story. Been going through some stuff lately with all this extra face time with my partner. For the last 11 years we have been in a battle of wits because ever since taking a few classes on human sexuality in college I came to the conclusion that ""I don't want to have sex with just one person for the rest of my life"" and ever since we have just been at odds, every argument devolving into ""well if you just want other women then go"" and I would swallow my pride and try and make things up as best I could. Don't really regret any of this but in retrospect I was just hurting myself my not just ""doing what I want"" and letting the chips fall where they may. I stifled my education, felt no motivation to acquire wealth or solidify friendships. It all kept coming back to this futility between what I want and what I am ""supposed"" to want. All I wanted was to do this in the ""best"" way for both of us, wanted to be as honest as possible, and wanted to ultimately fill our life with love and social connection. She wouldn't even accept that I wanted those things, It had to be about her vulnerability in life, and everything I was saying/doing was just a means to get away and marry some other girl.... And my play was to waste my entire 20's on this?!?

Fast forward to the vids-19 and I simply couldn't keep pretending like this wasn't ruining my life. Basically a ""I love you, but I now realize that if I don't do this for myself then I won't respect myself as a man, or even as a father, and I don't want to bring crippled life into this world."" Didn't even have to say ""I'm going do it or I'm going to leave"" or any truly shitty ultimatum, just simply ""I am going to be doing this, and I respect you're decision to do what you will with that information.

Boom. Instant ""I want you to be happy, I know you really care about me etc. etc. etc. we can make this work.""

Where was this the last 10 years when I was trying to compromise and do things without being a dick? Why is this here now?

So off we go, she tells me ""I'd like to be a part of this journey with you, if you're patient with me I WANT to come along."" Go on a dating app for ethical non mono's, find a beautiful woman (whose partner wasn't a total goob) who was keenly interested in dating. All lights are green, I'm communicating with both of them and we are jiving well, I'm feeling... Good.

I start exercising more, cut crap out of my diet. It was easy! I had reason! I WANTED to be attractive again. And it felt... Great. Like a literal cloud had lifted from my vision and I could taste the vigor and optimism I had in my early 20s before it was chipped away. I started answering calls, I ""forgot"" to smoke weed from sunrise to sunset. So many things in life just started falling back into place.

When the time comes and we start a group text, everyone is talking and jiving, but I realize that my partner has only said one thing, and it's starting to feel awkward all around. When I ask her if she is having a hard time opening up, or if there is a reason she doesn't feel comfortable participating in the conversation she says... her fingers hurt too much....

Your fingers hurt?!?!? I excuse myself for a moment to try and smooth over my bubbling anger and take the time to think of the words to express my frustration, less than 3 or 4 minutes literally just took a piss. I come back and she is sleeping on the couch.

I become livid, absolutely livid (I have also been having to deal with the unemployment office on a daily basis which is incompetent as hell so my patience as a whole is way less than usual.) I tell myself I am going to have a glass of wine... literally black out after the first few sips and wake up with half a 6 pack and a pack of cigarettes with 4 missing. I was devastated, I had worked so hard to quit smoking, and had gotten my drinking under control years ago and I allowed myself to be crushed by petty squabble.

Long story short every micro step of the way she was sabotaging me, changing the rules of engagement. Generally running diversion as a means of delaying the inevitable.

Fast forward to today. In general we do our best to keep our good time ""good."" So we decide to pack a lunch and take a short 5 or so mile hike through the woods and have great conversation about our family, life goals, what we would want for our children. Just general good stuff that you look for in a good relationship. Get home, and try and tactfully inquire about some sexy time. She says something along the lines of ""its hard for me to feel sexy when your talking to other women."" so I take that for what it is, wait a while and eventually just rub one out. Not a huge deal, I've been taking care of myself for years now.

Some time later she comes up as I'm working on some Spanish lessons, asks me if I emailed her the recipe for this pizza dough I've been working on for the last 3 weeks (she knows I already did, she had it pulled up on her phone and I could see it!) I tell her that I'm pretty sure it's in her hand right now, she asks if I want to help her make it... Nah not what I'm ""wanting"" right now. She tells me she doesn't know how to use the kitchen scale... So I go and show her and carry on about my day.

Comes back up as I'm finishing my last lesson and asks, again, if I ""want"" to go pick up some cheese from the store for her... You know what, sure, I could use the air and stroll and I do love you after all.

I pop into the store, and grab 2 things instinctively. The cheese, and her favorite flowers.

As I'm walking back up the driveway the heavy shit hits... If I'm buying her these flowers because I want sex I'm just fucking myself over. I'm literally rewarding her for playing hard to get and trying to stifle my upward momentum. And out of my mouth with glee, almost as if they weren't my own words I say. ""Theses are my flowers!""

I come in hand her the cheese with flowers in hand. She is beaming, eyes welling up. ""Why did you get me flowers?"" I tell her I didn't, and that I got them because I just wanted them. I ask her, ""where do we keep the vases again?"" Plop that vase right in my officer and carry on with my day.

She literally won't stop BEGGING to give me sexual attention. But I'm good just wanked!

This is CRAZY. But it doesn't feel anymore crazy than what I was doing before placating her every-move.

Any tips to not ride this train off a cliff? I feel like I can still feel this way, and be sweet and loving and romantic, but right now I'm getting more positive attention being an asshole. I never wanted to believe that the whole ""assholes"" get girls thing was even real in any sense. Can I just like convey this to her somehow or am I best off maxing out on this new found mentality.

&#x200B;

In your post, you convey that you did a lot of things for your partner's sake that you didn't enjoy, that you were brainwashed by his ideology, and that you isolated yourself from friends.

&#x200B;

That translates to: You were willing to push aside your own boundaries and discomfort, put aside your ability to critically evaluate his ideology, and isolated yourself from other sources of stability and insight.  


It might sound silly, but almost all of us at some point in our lives are willing to do just that when: 1) We're in situations where we don't have much experience, or 2) We have some things about ourselves which cause us to feel insecure and willing to not respect our own wants and needs.  


The important part is to spend time learning more about yourself and figuring out if it was inexperience or insecurity.  If it was mainly inexperience, you can chalk this relationship up to the 'lesson learned' side.  You will know to avoid a man like him in the future when it comes to relationships.  


If it was an insecurity, you'll continue to date the same kind of guy again and again until you strengthen, heal, and understand the things you feel insecure about.  


Sometimes RedPill guys are right when they disparagingly say 'All Women Are Like That'... and sometimes women are right when they say disparagingly say 'All Men Are Like That'.  Not because what they believe is true, but because they live their lives in such a way that they filter out all the healthy people who are \*not\* like that.

It's important to learn from this relationship so that you don't partner with another man like that and end up losing friends and disrespecting yourself.  


Being alone for a while sucks.  Ending a relationship sucks.  Losing friends sucks.  
But you really lucked out that this relationship ended.  


You now have awesome downtime to reflect and reconnect with some of the friends you lost along the way.",0

The female hypocritical BS noted by OP is just women's politics or feminism and shows why feminism along with all other IP's is so toxic, dishonest, and dangerous.

Thank you for all of the support. I didnt think Id get it. Ive posted on reddit so much for therapeutic reasons and met with a lot of hostility. I decided to just grow up and realise I was being an IDIOT. Ive had female friends, Ive got with girls in the past, I dont deserve this idiocy and neither do women or those around me. I am gonna change, but not to get laid or anything. Actually, I suspected that I wouldnt ever get laid and I literally didnt care - because I wanna love women not hate them, have a healthy mindset to benefit my happiness and those around me. However it turns out Im actually fairly cute - so fixing my mindset and being happy, I might actually attract a girl, if I am lucky. But if it dont: its okay. Im not entitled to anything and if I was never to meet another woman again in my life, I still dont want this hate and sadness in my heart. Thanks for all the replies and the many who private messaged me, which all of them were women bar one - which is just a great show of how kinda women can be and how diverse and different they are. 

Ive got friends, I was working out and continue to do so, I have hobbies but I wanna develop more, try out any sport I can once I get to college, go to college to better myself, all the while working on myself. I feel as if the past year of depression and suicidal thoughts are coming to an end - I have hope again. Thanks everyone",0

The other responses illustrate this - ""we don't want to wear makeup/lingerie anyway"" is the overwhelming consensus.

""Men dont dress for women to find them attractive. They dress so other men do not hurt them.""
I take issue with this for a couple reasons. 

1. Men absolutely do dress and behave in a way they think will attract women. Currently, most women are not willing to date gender non-conforming men, and that will have to change in order for straight men to be willing to stray from gender norms.

2. Women are just as capable of hurting people as men are, and women are just as active in policing male gender norms as men are.",0

So Ive been off of the TRP subs for close to a year now, as I spent most of 2018 reading, absorbing, and learning as much as possible. The last year was spent applying what Ive learned. 

No shocker here, but the results have been great. Success with women has been awesome, Ive built my own business, improved my physique and also replenished my finances.

Lately though Ive been feeling some anxiety and low level depression seep back in, so Ive restarted my therapy appointments.

With the TRP principles internalized, its hard for me to not speak about certain subjects and it comes out through a TRP perspective.

I can already tell that my (female) therapist thinks Im sexist or misogynistc. Pretty much any of the females in my life come to a similar conclusion and think Im an asshole, or evil.

Im not an autist with what Ive learned. I dont openly talk about TRP concepts or shove it in anyones face. But Ive internalized enough of it now to the point of its just who I am for the most part.

I dont try to manipulate anyone, make them feel like shit, or harm anyone. I try to be an all around good person, but yet Im still hearing these comments and seeing disgusting faces at my beliefs.

in a way validating them. But the way you have tried to explain it, i want
every viewer to take a note of this. That kabir singh is an imperfect human
and we should realize every bad habit of his as bad and good traits of him
should be appreciated too. Considering him so great, publicising him as a
macho dude is in a way whitewashing every wrong thing in him and due to this i
was very uncomfirtable. I cant see the youth taking inspiration from this and

3657,3658,"Can't say I'm too surprised as it seems the same sort of phenomena seem in the past with academics on parental leave following the birth of a child, but also not sure about what to do with this.  Any thoughts?

As with many things, I'd expect a lot of proposed plans to be likely to fail to address the full range of incentives they might otherwise create.  e.g. if men are assumed not to be spending time while on leave or in quarantine doing the work of parents but rather doing research, any policy intended to address this issue would seem likely to strengthen incentives for men not to parent.

As the moment there's also a narrative of women's research contributions tending to be ignored, whereas in this case it seems to more openly acknowledge that the research simply isn't getting done due to competing time commitments for things like parenting.  I have a feeling that that will soon be forgotten again.

One trend that I'm also wondering about is household cleanliness and how quarantine might impact that.  Are people actually keeping their homes significantly more clean than in the past due to concerns over the pandemic, or might some levels of cleanliness be relaxed due to not having to worry about entertaining guests during this time?  (Am thinking here of women doing disproportionate housework, but perhaps also due in part to arguments that I've heard that women are held to higher standards for this - but perhaps from visitors rather than from their partners).",0

I don't understand the inner workings of Title IX or the American University culture enough to definitively say either way.

I don't like the style and it was purchased for and came from the home he shared with his ex. Now, he wants to purchase two cellular shades to cover two windows in the living room. The shades cost $400 just for two! (we thought it would cost half as much) The dining tables I'm interested in costs $450-$500. When we realized the price I messaged him that its really expensive and asked if we could get a different type of cellular shades or use curtains for now. I also said I'd rather spend that amount of money on a dining table. He responded with that he would appreciate the blinds more and that we can go buy them today. 

He makes way more money than I do. I work reduced hours because of the virus but my hours have fluctuated between full and part time.

There are lots of elements that it can't.

A -  Bcoz I think they are not being nice properly.. They dropped niceness the moment they get rejected even a little bit..

She hate you for acting and thinking yourself as a nice guy when clearly you are not one

In this scenario, i certainly won't blame the directors or producers, because
I'm sure they may have great scripts, but the audience in India is such that
they dont want to see that. They don't support it, they dont like it. They
want to see that typical ""mirchi masala"" movie and they dont want to think
beyond that. In such a situation, the cinema industry has no option but to
comply with them.  
  
I think its high time we open up our narrow thinking. I saw Joker yesterday,
and oh boy was that a masterpiece. I find it hard to believe that we dont have
such brilliant ideas, but bringing it to the big screens is the biggest
problem. I can do nothing but hope that one day, bollywood moves on and gives
a chance to better projects. Kudos!",0
3544,3545,"how mgotw and redpill made me fearful of women and how I got out.Howdy ladies and gentlemen.

First of all I want to say that I never was an outright member of both movement. I agreed with some concepts and while I never fully drank the koolaid, it profoundly affected me and after 2 long years of being consumed by this ideology, I can finally say that I got it all out of my system. I write this with the hope that it can help others dealing with the same stuff that I've dealt with.

# The beginning

It all started when I was about 17/18-ish. During this time I used to browse 9gag a bunch and in there I would sometime read about people being screwed over, relationship wise. At the time I just thought ""shit happens"", but those posts would come again every now and then.

My downfall really started on quora and reddit. A big difference between 9gag and these 2 Websites was that the posts didn't have character limits. Quora questions like ""how you found out that your xxx was cheating on you"" and subreddits like r/Relationships would lead to posts with lengthy explanations as to how people (usually men) would be cheated on in the worst way possible. I remember how I would spend entire afternoons scrolling and scrolling and this made me extremely anxious.

My current situation was as follows: Overweight, virgin, no friends and my self confidence was at an all time low. Just to make you understand how bad it was, I loathed  and was fearful of calling delivery services / making appointments and I almost had a heart attack while asking for a summer internship over the phone.

# The redpill and mgtow

This is when I started to discover the redpill. I watched channels like sandman and other mgtow related stuff and would start to lurk repill and mgtow subreddits. In the beginning it felt as if the pandora box was opened. They said that Women would cheat on you regardless of your value as a man and that they would milk you dry if you let them do it, and everywhere I looked, I would just find more stories that would confirm what I've read and heard from this redpill people.

Even though I was deep in the red pill, I still would have not considered myself to be an outright member of these group. You see, while I believed in hypergamy and the 20% / 80% stuff, I still couldn't buy the ""all women are like that"" mentality, both from a logical but also an emotional point. i.e. the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are men, but I never heard women saying anything about all men being child predators (as far as  i'm concerned). I also have a wonderful sister that is in a relationship and looking at them I would see the exact opposite of what the redpillers would say. She would often spend money on him, she took interest in what he did, etc. If my sister was like that then it wouldn't have been a far stretch to also believe that other women like my sister existed.

To be completely honest I wasn't angry at women, I was scared of them. I was scared that I could be cheated on, that if I got married, they would divorce me and take my stuff or that that she could have an affair and I would have raised a child that was not mine. To give you an example of how deep my paranoia went, I often played with the idea of having hidden cameras in my house, trackers in vehicles and taking paternity tests behind a potential partner's back just to be sure that I wouldn't not meet the same fate as the people who got fucked over.

# How I got out

Well, to be completely honest it was a multitude of things. First thing first, I deleted reddit and quora. This places were tainted to me and even nowadays I get somewhat nervous if I enter these websites. The next step was actually going my on way. Instead of listening to bitter and resentful people, I slowly  began to block their generalized opinion and actually started to build an opinion of my own. I started to hit the gym (lost 21 kg / 46 pounds) , learned to be impartial and to take any opinion with a grain of salt. More importantly, I started to be critical of my own beliefs. If I didn't have a sound logic to it, it had to go.

Now I'm 20 and I'm far more calm and retrospective person. I'm still a shy guy and still never had a girlfriend, but that's just what it is. I learned to not being so fearful of random people and more importantly pizza delivery services.

On Monday I will call a company to see if they will give me a another summer internship and to be honest, I'm already shitting my pants, but at least now I know that I have to face my fear instead of letting it dominate me.

cheers.

  
EDIT:

I called. It went good. Nothing official because of the current situation, but I'm confident I will get the place.

4941,4942,"How to move on and let go?Basically I'm asking for advice on how to move on and let go of this girl who has been tormenting me in my own head. She lived next door and we quickly became friends  as we had a lot in common. At the time I was very bad with girls and had no experience. I quickly developed a crush on her but had no idea to make a move. She would often flirt with me when drunk but I was oblivious and shy at the time. Fast forward I grew some balls and started talking to girls and getting with women. This led to me and her eventually hooking up. However she quickly started displaying weird behavior. She would flirt with me all night and then leave with another guy, was constantly hot and cold I thought I was buggin but her friends agreed that this was a habit of hers. I became upset with her and my neediness caused her to end things but I found out that she had lied to me about something else and ended our friendship. She begged me for forgiveness and so I forgave her.

The year after we start hooking up again but one night while we're walking home she ditches me and sleeps with my best friend who had a gf. He knew I liked and even bragged about lying to her and how bad she wanted him to me and other friends. Im beyond upset and tormented. Firstly that she would sleep with a guy like that, I usually couldn't care who she sleeps with, not that she even needs my permission but it just makes it ten times worse to think that she would sleep with a guy like that. (fast forward he did something similar to another friend months later but they were actually about to date the girl.) . Obviously this is more of a me problem why does it bother me so much that she'd sleep with a guy like this. I mean I'd understand like if the guy was actually charming but he wasn't good looking, was narcissistic and a compulsive liar. When I asked her about it she said she was really drunk and him as well, which checks out. But idk if she was drunk enough that she didn't know what she was doing.

An important part of this story is we never had sex we would always get close but she always claimed she'd feel bad bc her best friend had a huge crush on me and told her not to. Which was true. I think this made it all the more worse as he got something so easily that I had been trying so hard for. But she also had a string of toxic behavior that made me question if this was the real reasoning or if she was just manipulating me, for validation.(I could never tell although she did seem sincere when she said she did want to sleep with me). 

Logically I know this girl and friend aren't for me and I should move on from both but their both stuck in my head, its been many months now and time isn't helping. I constantly think about the two of them together. And for some strange reason I still want her, no girl has come close. I've had sex with a few more girls since but nothing is filling the gap. I want her out of my head

Week 4: Style

Long before MRP, I was wearing old shoes and clothes. I just did not give a fuck. Right before I started on my journey, I figured out I needed basic, new shit. Anyways, Ive only touched on the surface, more than likely. I want to develop my own signature style, that screams grown and sexy.

Plan: Re-assess my current wardrobe. Find and throw away anything with a hole in it or fading in color.

Buy shirts, slacks, jeans, etc. that better align with my coming image of how I see myself. (Will be ongoing). Buy some more jewelry. Im a big fan of wrist wear, but only have a MVMT watch and a bracelet thats long overdue for replacing.

DoD Snowball:

Week 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily.

Week 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat.

Week 3: Hygiene, Hair, Cologne: Brushing 3x, flossing 1x, mouthwash 1x (minimum). Keeping body hair trimmed and neat.

Career/Work:

Sticking to the plan. Studying, networking, and looking for/creating opportunities. I've broadened my thinking on this, however, and realized my goals here were quite superficial. I am looking into meaningful work that will satisfy me, and enable me to live the life I want to live. 

This week:

*Im shortening these up, so I may leave out a lot of detail. If anything catches your eye, just reply.*

So, I had a fight with wife. It was all my fault. I was frustrated about some shit she had said, and took it out on her the next day. Yes, passive aggressive and weak. Id like to focus on some takeaways from the experience:

1. My wife pointed out that she had been going to bed early, because she knew that I would justpursue sex. (This is what she did) My takeaway: Im boring and predictable. I alsoforce the sexual experience instead of letting it unfold (as mentioned in NMMNG and TWOTSM).  
2. (Next day) I told her that she could leave if she didnt want to participate as a family. She left and came back multiple times that day. Hysterical each time. I told her I wanted her gone, and to go take a walk for a few hours.My takeaway/actions: I acted like a bitch by giving her an ultimatum. What I mean by this is that I should not have to coax and threaten someone into doing something I want them to doespecially when it comes to participating in my family. My wife is showing me that I am not where I \*thought\* I was with my own mentality. She did threaten divorce, and I called her on her bluff. So, I may bengaf, but I still have a ways to go with frame.
3. I have backed off. I had a covert contract with myself. Half covert contract, half pride and ownership. I was still looking for approval from mommy, and it was showing up in other areas.  

I reset and have reevaluated wtf I was doing and how I was going about it.  I realize that, despite me getting stronger, trying to be more awesome and happy, etc. I was just, slowly, building a covert contract. I didnt have a complete meltdown and light the dynamite, but (almost)everything I was doing was for the wrong reasons despite my good intentions.

Action Plan: Okay, so Im reading sidebar, Im lifting, and Im STFU. Im a whole lot better than I was when I started, but Im still a shithead faggot, eating paint.

1. I am realizing I will fail at this shit, and thats okay. Whats important is to learn and keep pushing forward. I wanted to dump my whole marriage this passed weekend, but that wouldve been the easy way out. Keep pushing.  
2. Learn from these experiences. As David Deida says, What is my woman trying to teach me here? What can I learn from the feminine? How can I find my more masculine source, (who the fuck I really am) through my life experiences with my woman, career, world, etc.?
3. Lead myself first, please myself first. My needs come first.

**Kids:**

My middle son is a mommys boy. My fault. I have not spent enough time with him, giving him the attention and love he deserves. This (probably) explains why he sucks his thumb, insists on sleeping next to mom, and defers to her authority. Ive backed off of using my forceful way of getting him to do what I want him to do. In a lot of ways, Ive used similar tactics with my wife, on him (ultimatums, threats, etc.)  well, the shit doesnt work.  


**Further thoughts:**  


>Further thoughts:I'm finding less and less 'shit' to own. ~~Maybe I'm not looking hard enough?~~

**I wasnt. This hole Im in is deeper than I thought.**

Im working on my mission now and getting back into my masculine by meditating and asking myself what I truly want from life, irrespective of family and expectations held by family members.

Im digging deep and trying to get to the bottom of the question of Who am I.

I see my woman as a representation of the feminine. As such, I have a lot to learn from her and learn about myself as I interact with her moods. I will dance with the feminine instead of seeking to control it.

4295,4296,"My review--  
I loved it. I loved the hell out of it.  
  
Not because I fanboy over Kabir Singh and his dominating ways. Not because I
liked how he controlled over the entire college campus and marking the girl.
No. If I'd met someone like Kabir Singh, I'd have never accepted him.  
  
I loved because of the storytelling itself. It wasn't a usual story of boy
meets girl, face problems, get married, over. I loved how flawed both
characters were because of which it felt so real at some parts. You could feel
the emotions, the anxiety, the chemistry between the two leads. In many
movies, you don't really feel for a couple. Like they r just put out there for
the sake of the movie. But here they made sense in their own imperfect ways. I
loved how flawed Kabir was. It made him more human. I hated his ways but over
the course of time, so many things happen to him and he does Grow.  
  
I don't know why some critics think this movie is glorifying anger, macho
behaviour, dominance and alcohol. In the movie, no one encourages to do these
things. Infact, if I remember correctly, his parents, brother, friends,
principal-- all of them tell him to STOP. They clearly state it's WRONG. And
he faces the CONSEQUENCES for that. His temporary suspension from college, his
father throwing him out of the house, a case registered against him, losing
his medical license for a few years-- these were all the result of his
behaviour and habits. Very later on, if these Kabir haters observed, they
would see a GROWTH in his behaviour. He stops drinking, gathers a little
patience and reflects on his life. If he was a totally shit character to you
ppl, he wouldn't have told the truth during the court hearing. He wouldn't
have felt guilty at all and would have continued to behave like that. Despite
his issues, he cared for his patients.  
  
As for his behaviour with Preeti, he was sweet and loving with her, most of
the time. Yes, he claimed her and all in the beginning, he never once FORCED
her anything. Preeti wasn't obligated to anything, you see. If she didn't like
going out with him, she would have refused it from the get go. But she clearly
LIKED it. It was her personal choice. Kabir slapped her but Pretti slapped him
too- Multiple times. It was Preeti who made the first move to kiss him. It was
Preeti who begged him not to go. Was that Kabir doing it too? Both of them
faced many things. They deserved their happy ending.

That is low enough in price that you can continuously add new wheat to storage without impacting the bottom line.  You can do the same with beans and rice, but they don't store quite as well, and you can do the same with pasta which also stores well.

End result .. no worries, because you can prep long term with these kinds of dry goods for as long as you want, really .. and yeah, it might not be fun to sit around doing nothing but eating bread and drinking water, but you'd survive.

I mean if you were super worried about some meteor hitting the earth or something, you could literally have half a U.S. standard short ton of wheat (1000lb) for 800 USD, which is like 1.5 MILLION CALORIES ... which at 2000 calories a day would last you like 700 days ..

3408,3409,"Look man Im not gonna lie to you, but I never thought I was gonna lose my virginity. I lost it at 21, kind of late compare to my peers. Honestly, I was pressured by friends to lose it. However, I held my ground and just told them if I lose it Ill lose it. What Im saying is dont put losing your virginity on a pedestal, when I first had sex it was awkward asf. When I first lost it, I was like was that it? So right now Im glad youre seeking help. What the others have said is take walk or start lifting. 

Im so glad I started lifting not only it help your health it also boosted your confidence. However, since all the gyms are closed right now Ill suggest just taking walks then start transitioning into running. Also, like another redditor had said to start worrying about your looks as well. Girls actually see that, if you cared about how you dress/groom yourself. It shows that how you actually present yourself as a person. I highly suggest going to therapy to get your mental health back on track as well.  At the end of the day, is the fact youre trying to better yourself. Since the gyms are closed, I hope you join one once this all blows over. I know you may feel intimidated at first, but honestly people dont care about what you look like or do. Since they are there to workout and move on with their day. Because at the end of the day youre there to better yourself. If they say something about you they can go fuck themselves. I met a lot of friends from the gym. 

Also, one last thing is during this time find a hobby and start branching and find people with similar interests. Then build a connection with them and you never know that you might find that someone and it blossom into something more. I suggest trying to find three hobbies that helps you be creative, money, and being healthy. I as would like to suggest a book to read as well. Its called The subtle of art of not giving a fuck by mark Manson. Truly a really good book on developing a better mindset. You got this I believe in you. This whole subreddit got your back.

3781,3782,"How do you dress breastfeeding boobs?I'm struggling with my postpartum body. I've pretty much lost all the pregnancy weight, but the weight was never the issue. My boobs grew like two cups sizes and I *hate* them. None of my light, flowy blouses fit. None of my bras. I've got a handful of shirts I'm surviving in and like three bras that actually fit...

What's worse, is most of my clothes thst do fit don't fit them right. I'm top heavy. And I can't wear any tight or supportive bras while I'm breastfeeding. And I actually breastfeed via exclusive pumping, so being able to access both to put on a pumping bra is a necessity.

And my husband finally has some time to help me with my intense nine month old and all the stores I would normally go to are closed. We are students, so I don't have a ton of money to spend. Amazon is a favorite.

So, all that being said, any words of wisdom or links to pumping friendly giant boob clothing? I'm finding that alot of cute, fitted dresses would fit my bust but be loose everywhere else.

There isn't necessarily just one norm, there can be different norms enforced and approved by different groups.  If you don't conform to the jock norm, maybe you can conform to the punk norm and you fit in there.  We internalize the norms and use them to define ourselves and they also limit us and our expressions of who we are.  

In your example, you identified two different man norms, the first one is just a much softer norm.  Generally the more strict, oppressive, and coercive a sex/gender norm is the worse it is, and all norms are at least a little coercive.",0

You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and
the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts,
situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal
level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very
existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but
at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so
important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or
dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the
opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we
should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all

3352,3353,"How is non-neediness different from arrogance or disinterest?For a long time, I have had to problem to understand what neediness is to begin with. But now to some extent I think I get it. However, most times my non-neediness comes across as disinterest or arrogance.

For ex: A girl expects me to be in touch with her constantly. We can't be meeting all the time. She expects that we are in touch with each other constantly either through call or text. So, I'd say I'm busy or I'd say normally I don't text so much but rather I'd like to meet in person instead. Somehow, she ignores this and keeps texting me. Now if I do respond to her everytime she texts me, I'd be texting all day long and eventually I'll come across as low value. On the other hand if I don't reply or take a long time to reply, it'll come across as disinterest or arrogance and she may auto-reject or go find someone who can cater to her needs. If I like the girl, I'll be losing her either way. How do I balance this?

P.S: Above example can show up in different forms and at different stages.
This question may have been asked already but I couldn't get an answer that I'm specifically looking for in this context. So had to re-ask",0

After like 3 months, I  started to realise that sometimes people scare that im holding eye contact and in that moments I felt creepy . Idk maybe i misinterpreted their body language maybe they were not scared but still sometimes that happens and I feel creepy occasionally if that happens.

In my mind, though, its hard not to feel like the two cant coexist: like if we dont have some amount of sympathy for these people then they may never feel compelled to improve. I may be totally wrong though. 

As for other comparable crimes I meant like people who killed another person by accident, or trafficked illegal drugs. Obviously killing people is wrong and depending on where the drugs came from they may have been indirectly supporting other crimes such as human trafficking. I suppose its easier to feel sympathy for these people because either didnt mean to hurt someone else or they didnt directly commit a crime against another person, though logically I know that these crimes arent any less bad than sex crimes.",0

5234,5235,"A Man's Worst EnemyDiscussed in greater detail on my [daily video.](https://youtu.be/n7msLY3sEjQ)

There lurks an enemy in the soul of every man. So insidious is the enemy that many cannot even see it or know it.  

It is the difference between a rich man and a poor man. A CEO and an underling. A 'has' and a 'has not'. Someone who learns from those who have paved a successful path and someone who complains that they can't be successful and gives excuses.  

That enemy of man is Instant Gratification.  

**Examples include:** 

\-Eating a sugary treat when you know you should eat healthy 

\-Hitting the snooze button instead of jumping out of bed and working out 

\-Going out with friends instead of studying finishing that project or studying for that exam 

\-Taking out a high interest loan and eventually shelling out way more money for it instead of saving for it and paying with cash 

\-Playing video games instead of building out a business or brand or any other passion that could actually make you money 

\-Looking at porn and shooting your mojo into a tissue instead of letting it build up and guiding you into starting new relationships

In the end, all of these things come down to you being addicted to dopamine. Your body will supply you with dopamine when you do any of the above and there are many more examples than what I just listed.  

So what is the answer to fighting this? Well that should be obvious.  

The ally in this fight is Delayed Gratification. But how do we get in contact with this ally?  

You can throw away your video games and your drugs if you need to. It's an extreme method of control, but if you are constantly succumbing to instant gratification it is something to consider.  

One of my favorite ways to do that is this:  

Get in touch with your 'future-self' and ask yourself now what you wish you had done as your 'past-self.'  

For example... where do you want to be in 20 years? Perhaps a nice house on some big land. 3 cars. Maybe some kids. Maybe not. But do you really want to be living in your parents basement or with roommates? What is your 50 year old self going to say to your 25 year old self? Let me tell you this... as a 34 year old man I curse my 21 year old self. I had ample opportunity to be in the military.. to study hard.. to lift weights earlier.. to be much more successful earlier on. But no, I pissed my early and mid 20s away with video games, marijuana and porn. Yes I still bedded women but for what? My success today is largely based on choices I made in my 30s. My 50 year old self has desires and I cannot let that future man down.  

Do not let your future-self down! 

**Lessons Learned:**

All the choices we make today shape our future. If you can truly delay gratification you are setting your self up for a much brighter and successful life. If you are constantly giving into your desires for a quick dopamine hit your future will be less than it could have been.",0

Gender identity can be problematic for two reasons. One, due to the huge discrimination people face for what is or isn't hanging between their legs, and the fact that gender identity is often tied up with that, means it's not as trivial as identifying a punk for example. Two because of the aforementioned discrimination gender identity can often be empowering.

So while I disagree with gender entirely and think it's complete bullshit. I won't ever call someone out for having one. I'm saying this as a white hetronormative cis gendered male. So I can't ever really know the empowerment a gender identity might bring. My identity has never been under attack.

My point is the above commentor is saying there is nothing wrong with saying bodybuilding is masculine or knitting is feminine as long as recognise a man or woman can do either and don't pigeonhole people. But of course they are free to correct me if I got the wrong end of the stick.",0

6051,6052,"See, the problem is you're comparing Western media to Eastern.

In Western media, a character isn't just a character. No, they *represent* an entire class of people! At least, that's how it is to the loudest voices (i.e. ""journalists"" and Twitter-addicted losers). You can't have a Galbrush in Western media, because if she's abused or is a failure, it somehow represents *all women* or how the author *views* all women, and is thus sexist.

In Eastern media, a character IS just a character, and not a vehicle for representation. At least, the media/fans don't treat it as such (unless it's reviewed by Western media idiots, like ANN). So, you *can* have a Galbrush in Eastern media, because she is allowed to be flawed or is allowed to fail or be abused.

You rarely see any ""controversy"" about anime/manga/LNs until they come over here... For example, I believe ANN had interviewed the director or producer of the Goblin Slayer anime (I think?) and asked them about how they handled the controversy over in Japan, and their response was basically ""what controversy?""   
That is to say, it's not like they *don't* get whiners from the East. Like with the recent ""controversy"" over a My Hero Academia villain... it was *Chinese* fans getting angry, claiming the character's name was a WW2 reference... So Horikoshi changes the character's name... and then they're *angry about the new name*, too.",0

Personally I think the time of men holding almost all of the cultural power is long past. We're left with the legacy of patriarchy, but each of us, as an individual, can choose to perpetuate it, or to fight it. This is a fight that men and women are a part of equally.

It just feels odd to me that when men's issues are brought up in feminist spaces, there always needs to be the caveat that ""men made it this way"". Why is that so necessary to bring up? Why the need to always take anti-male sexism and re-label it as misogyny? Even if misogyny may have played a part in the formation of a gendered double standard (which personally I would dispute in certain cases), men are suffering from it now. It feels almost like it's intended to downplay the very real struggles men face, or suggest that men alone are responsible for fixing them.",0

I am at odds. I realised that I have been treating my boyfriend like my husband - what should I do about this?

 We've been together for 2 years (the first year was on and off and this year has been stable). Yesterday night we were talking on the phone and I joked saying I like the nick name Bubby because its hubby and baby mixed into one. We have been discussing marriage alot since being in Quarantine so I guess I felt comfortable making that joke. Then he said laughing that it was too soon and I shouldn't call him that. That shut me down - it made me realise I have been giving myself to someone as if he were my husband when he doesn't see himself that way or me like his wife. He is a good guy. He is loving and I would like to marry him some day. He said that however and I pretty much hung up and now I have this innate unease when I think about him. 

I know it is not his fault but I think I am more annoyed with myself for getting carried away - I am 20 and he is my first boyfriend so I can see why I fell into this pit of fantasy. When he said that it burst my bubble... I've lost my sexual attraction to him - me and him aren't really tied in any way so why should I give myself? We have treated sex casually in the relationship but I have been moving towards Chastity for a while now so because we are distanced due to this quarantine I have been turning him down for sexting and so on. I dont like sex being so casual anymore? But I was okay with it before? I cant help but see him as a user - even though that's not what is going on... I dont want to see him or have him touch me rn? I know I am being over dramatic. 

So...

What are husband benefits?

What are boyfriend benefits? 

Should I learn to compartmentalise the two? 

What are your experiences? 

How do I make it clear that wifey is something to be earned and that I am no longer going to be the way I was before?

5675,5676,"My teachers were generally pretty kind to me -- because I was a star pupil with a genuine love for learning and a creative, out-of-the-box perspective on just about every topic. HOWEVER, when I was bullied in class, they would do nothing to stop the bullies from picking on me. When I complained, they told me that without proof there was nothing they could do.

One day, in 7th grade, I brought a tiny recording device (this was in the late '90s, when dinosaurs walked the Earth and smart phones were not yet a given), and used it to record my bullies' merciless insults during our group lab. I planned on using the recording as proof of my suffering so maybe the teacher could intervene. Unfortunately I became upset and let the head bully know I was recording him. He immediately told the teacher I was recording him and the teacher, with an apology, confiscated my device.

There was another time in 6th grade where my bully was punished, but I was punished for my reaction to the bully. The bully in question publicly and loudly accused me of m""\*%$\*@$ing in the bathroom during an indoor recess held in the gym, and I left school right then and there, riding my bike home in the snow to escape the humiliation. My bully received 3 after-school detentions for her action, and I received a single day of in-school suspension (I got to do all my schoolwork and homework privately in school, and then read all day, not that much of a punishment).

There was also the time some idiot etched a b@mb threat across the bathroom walls in 9th grade, and a few bully types decided to accuse me. I was, of course, called into the school psychologist's office and questioned. And of course when I tried to explain my suicidal thoughts resulting from years of bullying to that same school psychologist, I was sent to a hospital for a suicide risk assessment. Same after the 11th-grade ""Project Love"" anti-bullying seminar, in which I publicly announced the division between school-aged ""Predators"" and ""Prey Animals"" and theorised that merciless bullying by the stronger ""Predators"" was a subconscious attempt to convince the less popular among the population to off ourselves, culling the herd until only the more desirable folks remained.

All people suffer from alienation and loneliness. It's just that mens form makes them more likely to (wrongly) consider feminism as an enemy rather than a solution, and to ignore things that can actually help them (like self reflection in order to counter toxic masculinity).


It's also that there haven't been many male-liberation movements that have been openly feminist, most have been about reinforcing the patriarchy on themselves further. It's also that most male-led feminist movements have been very openly radical, openly marxist feminist, meaning men have further considered them as enemy rather than a solution to the problems of patriarchy",0

5220,5221,"Original TRP post by u/taracus on this story:

http://archive.is/lv4aW

>Summary: OP (girlfriend) gets asked by an ""ancient ex"" to meet up in Amsterdam for a week while he is there for work (he lives in Italy and she in the UK). She books the ticket before mentioning anything to her BF because:
they were on sale for a ridiculously low price on the dates that he would be there, so I jumped at the opportunity.

>Boyfriend breaks up with her without loosing frame and even 'that' subreddit calls her out for being wrong.

>Body: So they've dated for 6 months and she thinks that going alone to Amsterdam to meet up with an ""ex from ancient history who is more like a best-friend"" is a good idea. She starts with the excuses even in the title.

>Her boyfriend shows exactly how a situation like this are to be handled, no harsh words, no complaining about not going simply holding frame:

>Pete seemed cool with it at first but after a few days asked me if there was any history between us. I was honest and told him there was. He didn't seem too bothered and eventually asked if I thought visiting an ex in another country was appropriate whilst in a relationship. I explained to him how Dave and my relationship wasn't like that and that we were strictly platonic. He didn't seem to really react, he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic, I suppose, would be the best way to describe it.

>Edit: ""he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic"" -> ""dont need to talk, just grin"" (c) Endorsed TRP-philosophy.

>First he calmly suspects that this is more than platonic and asks her and her hamster believes that going a week to Amsterdam with an ex to do drugs and partying is a sign of a ""platonic friendship"" and feels safe confessing that he is actually an ex. He then proceeds to ask if she think its appropriate (not telling her its not, just vetting to see if she is really LTR material).
She then pulls out the ""strong independent black woman"" card as a response:

>I then told him that I wouldn't be controlled and hated men that thought they owned me and could tell me what to do. I told him I was free to see who I wanted and that I found his lack of trust in me upsetting, disrespectful and, perhaps, a sign of future abusiveness. I now realise that this may have been a bad thing to say. Again, he didn't really react so I thought that was the end of it.

>Here most men would have caved, given her reasons not go, told her not to go or even worse, supported the idea of the trip because nobody wants to be an ""abusive boyfriend"". Her boyfriend on the other hand shows exactly how to hold frame he even explains it to her:

>Then, last night, he came around to my flat and broke up with me! I asked him why and tried to get him to explain himself and he told me that my going away was to see ""another man"" a deal-breaker, that he'd been in this type of situation before and wasn't going to go through it again. I asked him if this was an ultimatum - I hate ultimatums, they are tools of abusers - and he said ""No, its not an ultimatum. I've decided to break up with you. I have not presented you with any options. I just came to say goodbye."" Before I could say or do anything more, he kissed me on the forehead, said goodbye and walked away. He didn't seem angry, just...sad.

>No harsh words, no ultimatums, no anger, just HELD FRAME. He realise a women that cant show her relationship the respect it deserves dont deserve him and he simply lets her go.
Here comes some bonus:

>To make matters worse, I told Dave about what happened and he replied ""Oh well, guess that means we can have even more fun then! ;o)"" He didn't care about my relationship and my pain - he just wanted a hookup buddy and someone to get stoned with whilst he was in Amsterdam.
Suprise, her ex-boyfriend didnt invite her to Amsterdam to party to have a platonic friendship re-kindle. 

>Obviously both men in this story knew exactly what was up but she comes to the Internet asking for advice of what went wrong.

>I tried calling Pete today, about an hour ago, and he actually answered! He told me that I should look to be with someone who wasn't so abusive. He said, ""Please stop calling me - this is over. Have a nice trip to Amsterdam"" Then he BLOCKED me! How could he do that to someone he loves? Is he over reacting or was I? What should I do now? Was I wrong?

>""How could he do that to someone he loves?"" she asks herself without any self-reflection (until even the Internet told her that yes, you were wrong).

>Lessons learnt:
>Women believe in their hamsters, they are not lying when they say they ""didnt cheat"" or ""it just happened"", just because she believes her own lies dont mean you have to.
Hold frame, even if your girlfriend is planning on going on a fuck-trip to Amsterdam with an EX.

Mystery solved, weight continuing down. A big part of the problem was that I wasn't drinking enough water.

###Financial

...

###Professional

...

###Social

I deleted the dating apps, too much temptation for quick validation when I'm bored at work.

I have built a schedule for my time.

I'll be spending 3 dates a week discovering and working on my covert contracts, maintaining boundaries, Game, Kino, initiation, OI, passing shit and comfort tests from 3+ ""different"" women who all know I'm seeing other women, and developing and maintaining the beginnings of my Frame. 

###Mental

I couldn't figure out a way to make the leap to internal abundance (non-external based) when it comes to my value to women while sitting in my house being in my own head.

Plating was absolutely about seeking external validation at the start and still is to a certain extent, ""proof of concept"" for myself, and I made an extremely risky move that I'm still fighting my way through internally... I could become addicted to the external validation (I'm still working to understand, minimize, and regulate my *desire to be desired* vs having the proper mental model of ""assumed desire"" - *of course they desire me - because I have high value as a Red Pilled man who owns his shit - this one is lucky I'm deciding to gift her with my time and attention*, it is extremely easy to be on the wrong side of that line, or lie to yourself about which side of it you're on) 

I won't blame anyone but myself if shit hits the fan because of my choices. 

I've made some progress already, but not the full on critical leaps that are necessary to never need this kind of external proof again. 

I had the internal realization that women's value of me isn't a worthy measurement of my value, not even this small part of my value, nor is it an accurate one. This is why it is so important to be my own judge in all things.

My mental state has quickly arrived at the fact that plating women can't be a mission, not even a side mission, its basically a distraction at best - a ""hobby of interest"" to pass time enjoyably and help one relax after a day spent living a fulfilling life. 

Women (single women especially) are all desperate to connect to a man who doesn't enervate them, and offers escape from their shitty, lonely existence. AWALT. J10 and u/HornsOfApathy put it well, and as I've been going on dates with these women over the last month while mostly Larping Alfa, the truth of that is crystal clear. The better I embodied that energizing HVM who could offer ""The Great Escape"", the better my dates went. Having an attitude and outlook absolutely overflowing with positivity and life energy (""Abundance"") was extremely attractive to them, whether in a high or low energy environment. 

I'm not that guy yet, but I'm not exactly Larping him either. He's in me, got buried alive for a while, and I just have to keep helping him grow to become an automatic part of who I am. 

J10 talked about a hot tub soak. One of my plates has a nice deep tub in her room connected to a standing shower (hers is the master in the house), so after we fucked this last time, I spontaneously had the desire to try it out. As a reward for her, I let her join me for the bubble hot soak. I had her sitting in my lap in the tub, both of us laid back, just relaxing and talking and joking about nothing important. She commented that she ""didn't think it would be this nice"" just to take a bath together. The time I spent at her place was less than 3 hours total, yet that *escape* was there, and was tied to having great sex with me. She was asking before I left if I could stay over, and when she could see me again. The next time she started the bath herself and asked me in.

This is like a different kind of dynamite, and I need to treat it with the same care.

I hadn't reread HOA's and J10's words prior to reflecting on this week in at least 4 months, and everything I've been doing with this chick and the other 2 has been almost 100% on instinct, very little thinking, so something somewhere must be clicking... the experiences I've had reminded me of their words. Good to reread them and remember what I'm working towards as a starting point for an eventual LTR if one of them vets properly, although not likely.

Fuck me... just reread the other parts of HOA's ""Great Escape"" and a staple of what I've been telling my plates from the very beginning is that I don't judge them, I only judge myself.

""No Judgement, No Expectations."" 

This is basically my catchphrase at this point whenever they tell me some shit they're nervous about sharing because its personal or they give me the cues that they're scared I'm going to ""run away"" because they have faults or whatever. Teaching them that their shit doesn't bother me or affect why I'm spending time with them, I'll just listen and thats it. 

I better go reread the Fundamentals of Frame posts because these plates are about to do a trust-fall straight through my ""Frame"" and its not going to be pretty if I'm not prepared to hold them in my Frame and they end up hitting the ground. I need to not be a cardboard cutout basically. Its well past time to be a man in more than words.",0

If we take it as a given that women are constantly in danger from men, because men are physically stronger, wouldn't it make sense to make military service mandatory only for women? After all, what better place to learn how to defend yourself with or without weapons, spatial awareness etc. than there?

If men are already the main danger to women and service is mandatory, then having only men do it actively REDUCES the safety of women in society, since now men are not only physically stronger and much fitter due to having spent several months if not years working on physical fitness, they're also trained in how to control, subdue, and even kill people.

6169,6170,"You are 20 and your SO is 24, which means he was about 22 when you met and started dating. It is rare that men are dating for marriage at that age. It is unlikely that he is dating you with marriage in mind. 

I was a couple of years older than you when I met my husband, who was in his late 20s at the time. We were both dating for marriage and moved in together after only 6 months and were engaged in less than a year and married less than a year after that. 

Very, very little has changed from the time we started living together and now as far as how we act. There is very little distinction between girlfriend and wife. For most women, the only distinction is allowing the government into your relationship through legal marriage. For some women, it may also mean engaging in physical activity outside of hand holding and side hugs. 

Here, I think the real issue is that your SO is not old enough to truly be prepared for marriage. At your age, relationships tend to take much longer before marriage.  Among my husbands friends, those who met their partners in their early 20s took nearly a decade to propose. In contrast, those who met in their partners in their late 20s and early 30s were ready to commit to marriage in 6-12 months.",0

In this situation, we have identified a victim of years long abuse, one where the perp has manipulated society at large and even spoke at the women's march. And now that the truth has come to light, feminism and the media are silent. And it's because it provides evidence of the fallacy of feminism and is an example of all the criticisms of the MRM/Anti Fem movement. And that can't be abided.

**Week Goals**

* One meditation session 20min  4 
* 10 min meditation  7/7
* Boundaries  9/10 
* Mobility 100% of intended sessions 
* No porn for four weeks  two week done 

**Reading:** NMMNG, MMSLP, Pook, MAP, Side Bar, Unchained male, models, The Eagle and the Dragon, WOTSM, WISNIFG, The dating playbook for men, The subtle art of not giving a fuck, The Rational Male, Awareness, Meditation Book (40%), NMMNG (40%), Stop walking on eggshells (50%). Sidebar.

**Mission:**

Win each day.

**Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.*

* Cardio times three (Hill sprints, run, metcon)  these are for mental health more than anything. 
* Weights three sessions
* I go in energy cycles, for a few days Ill need less sleep, be more awake and I think have orgasms that dont feel as good, then Ill be more tired, sleep more, and my orgasms feel betternot sure what the fuck that means. 

**Separation:**

Ex is using daughter as bargaining chip. The mediation process has been surprisingly unbiased after I got rid of the first mediator. I have only done the intake session and Im sure they try and make you feel heard so Ill wait until we actually sit down to make a call. Im doing what needs to be done. If we go to court, I am ready but I suspect this is stressing me out more than I realize (see mood in mental). 

*Guilt*: this is still a major problem for me. My ex has stopped my overnights for no reason and I still feel guilty only paying the mandated child support. Even the mediator asked if I had considered only paying what Im legally required to pay. There are benefits to paying more, but I can't separate how much is guilt and how much is the benefits. 

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

I am trying to focus on just doing what I want. Not putting it through any filters (society or MRP) just what I want. I still need to be very careful with all the covert contracts etc but Im trying to act more authentically and noticing when the shit comes up so I can more quickly move into that space. 

*Mood*: Lower than it has been over the past few weeks. I still have periods of joy but mostly when with my daughter. Feeling more emotional I feel like crying for no reason, watched something sad in a movie, felt like crying... Still mood is better than before the T-Cream. I have been deliberately digging into painful memories/thought patterns and maybe that plus the worry about the STI and ex being a shit with court is wearing on me. Im not entirely sure. 

When feeling flat Im focusing on letting go of shoulds e.g. I should be driven and crushing life and instead just taking the next manageable step. This is helping keep me more productive on these days. E.g. one day I was feeling a bit lazy and annoyed at myself, I should be driven and motivated at all times. But thats bullshit and just uses mental energy on negative thought loops, instead I checked off the productive things I had already done; work, got blood taken, ate healthy and then I went and meditated for 20min and did hill sprints. Consistent forward progress. I will apply my mental energy to this rather than chastising myself for failing. 

*Anger*: I have a lot of it, Im pissed at what happened to my dad, pissed at what happened to me and pissed at my ex. I am struggling to manage my anger at my ex. She is driving us towards court for ridiculous reasons and wont get what she wants out of it. I am praying in the iron temple and upping the cardio, channeling my anger there is helping. Also, Im trying to change the narrative, when I find myself running a skit in my head I replace it with, you have all the big wins already and you are just going to keep building a great life. What do you want right now? 

*Needs*: something that resonated from NMMNG was having needs means being needy and needy represents a one-way ticket to abandonment. I am really starting to see how having emotions was met by a parent shutting down and how this is driving a lot of my current dysfunctional relationship patterns. 

*Caretaking*: this runs so deep, I see myself as the protector from life. I dont know what I have to offer apart from this. I feel like women wouldnt want me unless I provide this. Interestingly the thing thats helping the most is time alone in nature, I feel my life energy I just exist and thats when I feel most whole. Women can want this or not its up to them. But on some level I know its more attractive. Still, new mental models take a while to embed and this is a deep one for me.

*Goals*: last week u/[Blarg\_Risen](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blarg_Risen)  pointed out I need goals. I still need to do some work in this space but I wrote down my values/who I want to be, my 3 month objectives and longer term goals. I read this regularly and am finding it is helping me stay focused. 

**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*

I am present and calm with daughter, I enforce boundaries but give her as much space to experiment with life as I can. Im happy with this area. Current focus areas are: be present, calm, clear boundaries, enabling independent play and not letting my stress with ex leak over into our interactions.",0

4623,4624,"Ask Fwbs if she's going cold/okay? Is this needy?Have been seeing my female FWBs for the last 6 months.  She initiated the whole thing. 

Back in Feb/March she started to tell me she was getting attached.  Towards the end of March she seemed to open a lot more and her feelings become quite clear - she was really really into me.  We were also having sex everyday at this point 

Since lockdown, we've barely been able to see each other (we do have a little bit of freedom), perhaps once a week.  The last couple of weeks she has started to go a bit cold - definitely less flirty, less emotional etc. by text, although she will message me first everyday.  Things started to go south when last week she said she couldn't come round but offered to see me on the weekend to which I said we'll have to see.  Anyway, we met on Saturday and had a good time.  I then asked her on Monday if she was free to meet but she said she couldn't.  I asked her again last night, she initially said no but then later she hinted at seeing me but I didn't pick up on the hint so we didn't. 

I want to ask her how she's feeling - I'm wondering if she's going a bit cold because she thought I was rejecting her or going cold towards her myself?  Is this a weak move to ask her? It feels  like I'm asking her where I stand?  There is something definitely up with her though but no evidence as such to back this up.  She used to message me a lot during work but that has slowed down, as with messaging in the evening - it's all a bit dry. 

I like her and want to keep this going but want to avoid coming across as clingy and needy.  On the one hand, it's like she's falling in love and she's trying to play it cool to not get her feelings hurt - but the on other, I can't tell if she's pulling back because she's getting bored - however, she will still message me first most days.  

Does anyone have any advice here?

Perhaps I could ask her ""I don't want anything to change, but I notice that you've been a bit quieter this week with me...""?",0

>These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly.

I used the wrong word for draconian. I didn't mean harsh per se...I meant one sided. What I meant was we're just going to say, all these programs are just going to be help women. Full stop. They do not apply to men. Just put all the cards on the table. 

The problem is that's not politically viable, I think. It just breaks a basic sense of fairness that I do think is dominant still. As well...I think it just makes the costs too evident. It's not some vague goal...it becomes...yeah...your son has to sacrifice to get the numbers right. Sorry, he has to give up on his dreams. I'm sure you'll make him understand that it's for the greater good. 

I think that's why it's not sustainable. That's the other side of the pendulum. We're stuck between a relatively vague commitment to ""equality"", which won't last under scrutiny at a systems/process level, and this other point of not wanting to be thrown under the bus/throw our loved ones under the bus, for the greater good of equality.",0

I hope you all get my message well.  
Last year in April I have arranged for my sister's wedding. We all were happy
and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their
demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband
and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from
Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times
police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become
innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my
sister. One day she told ""Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die
because of their torture and painless beat"". Then I have decided to go for
police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We
have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then
police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against
them so that they can feel guilty about their did.  
  
HOW CAN ANYONE SAY POLICE WILL TAKE ACTION SERIOUSLY? NOW POLICE HAS MORE
CHANCE TO DO CURRUPTION.  
  
IN INDIA DOWRY IS STATUS. I CAN BET 99.99% OF MARRIAGE CASE BOY WILL NOT

3192,3193,"When you treat relationships and human interaction like a game, or a playbook, or a video game talk system where you just select the right dialogue options and get what you want... you're bound to fail. That way of seeing a partnership is toxic and will weird out/alienate the other person. The thing to remember is that there is no rule book, no ""right"" way to talk to someone. The whole reason the red pill ""game"" philosophy is so flawed and useless is that other people aren't vending machines where you input the right code and love falls out. Everyone is a complex, feeling person just like you - the only way to win that ""game"" is to not play",0
