Males view women as wastes of space unless they're attractive, you can share all their views, doesn't matter.

If she was hot she could have killed people and have a career. 

All this mockery of her is just people justifying their sadism against women they view as unattractive at the end of the day.

5014,5015,"Part of the problem here is I dont think we will ever achieve statistical equality with those in power currently there.

The problem is that there is a lot of people in the field of gender equality which are only and exclusively advocates for women.

You can see how begrudging some of these schools were to allow men (into programs named for girls) simply so they could continue their agenda.

The problem is the mindset and goal is wrong. We cant even evaluate statistical inequality without looking at other things such as women making up 60 percent of degrees in masters programs. Just to point out how big that difference is and there is no school addressing it.

Also, I agree that STEM gives out harsher grades and there might be some difference either social or biological that causes that to affect women more. It could be because of inflated grades given for other subjects or if one sex is used to failiure more often that they perform better when failiure is a higher risk. However, we cant get to that conversation because people are trying to balance out percentages, but only ones they feel are discriminatory or that affect women.

These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly.",0

818,819,"Pretentious Indie Game SimulatorHi folks, I'm just your average non-binary/genderfluid/trans/differently-abled/autistic/immigrant indie developer from San Francisco.  


The last few years of my life have been very difficult . People have called me mean names on the internet for voicing my empathetic and well-researched opinion on the benefits of veganism. I received so many death threats and dick pics online that I  wasn't able to focus on doing my job. I just couldn't manage to play and  review the latest AAA games for 8 hours everyday. I was very concerned  about my life and mental health.   


So I decided to quit my stressful job working as a part-time writer for a gaming website and moved back to my father's mansion in LA. It was very hard to go back to a  life of solitude after having being used to the chaos of San Francisco.  


While  I lived in LA, I had the extremely difficult job of catching up on all the backlog of games that I had reviewed at my last job without playing.  Through this I discovered something about myself. I discovered my passion for copying other people's ideas and passing them off as my own.  


I knew what I had to do. I had to make my own game. It was literally the only way I could make my voice known.  


I  felt validated when my first post about the game got over a thousand likes. I was so proud that my amazing idea resonated with my 15000+  followers on Twitter. I knew I was onto something special when all my game journalist friends retweeted all of my 74 blog posts about how difficult it was to learn RPG maker to make this game. The idea was so  great that I managed to get the game funded without any sort of  marketing at all! It just goes to show that a good idea is all you need  to really create hype around your game.  


I'm proud to reveal that  I've spent the last 7 months of my life working on my magnum opus. I've put up 3 months of wages on the line into buying the assets for this game. I work on the game all the time. It is so hard to manage with my offshore programming team due to time zone differences. When I'm not streaming obscure 80s DOS games in my pajamas from my bedroom, I am either engaging with the game's backers or trying to explain to my programmer who barely speaks English that I want the game to use a  custom game engine to build the world's most high performance and cross-platform visual novel.  


I like to make games that express how I  really feel inside. I like to express myself online because I can't do that in the real world due to my repressed, shy, and introverted personality.  


This game recounts the first heartbreak in my life when I wasn't asked out to the dance by my high school's quarterback and instead had to settle for a linebacker. It also deals with my childhood's most traumatic horse polo incident. It recalls the liberating feeling when I and my ex-girlfriend simultaneously got our third abortion. It tells the story of a fish out of the water, ignored, who jumps out to discover that the sunshine is just an illusion perpetrated by the capitalist patriarchy.  


This is my story. This is my voice. This is my soul.

First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

That when they fail it seems worse than mans failures. 
I guy I used to know abandoned his kids for 5 year but got pats in the back for calling his kids on their bday but when she(the wife) divorced him and told the truth about what happened she was a bitch . 
So many men I know rely on their SO so much for basic needs cleaning/cooking that when they put away the dishes or vacuum the floor their heroes or deserve something. 
Men can walk away from their kids but if a women gives them up for adoption/abortion she a monster. 
Men can get away with changing their kids diapers once but god forbid a women hires a nanny or housekeeper. 
Single mother are shunned and laughed at but single fathers are heroes.

On the flip side, I've come across far more women virtue signalling ugly men online than I have in reality. A self pitying male irl doesn't really get more than an ""awww, I'm sure you'll find someone."" A self pitying male on Reddit will get ""awww no hun I find 3ft 700lbs guys super sexy.

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The problem is not ""them being whores"". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT.


The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

The post from the girl came on the day when the Bois Locker Room group controversy came to light, which has triggered nationwide outrage.

HT mentions an officer saying: No suicide note was found but messages retrieved from the boys phone showed that fellow students warned him that he will be questioned by the police.

Reports say that the police are investigating the deceased boy's alleged involvement in Bois Locker Room Instagram account. His phone has been seized and sent for analysis. The cyber crime cell has been looped in. His social media account and chats will be investigated to help understand why he took the extreme step.

The report says, ""The police official ruled out any foul play during preliminary investigation. The deceased has not left any suicide note. Further action will be taken only after detailed reports of his mobile analysis is received. As of now, legal proceedings under CrPC 174 have been initiated.""

As NCR fights against the Covid-19 situation, the incident involving a group of social media users on Instagram came to light. The incident, now known as Bois Locker Room incident, made news after a girl from South Delhi shared a screenshot on social media. The screenshot went viral.

The screenshot brought to light the activities on this particular group, where the users, as it appeared on the screenshot, showed school boys sharing photos of underage girls. The chats have shown the boys to have objectified the girls and to have planned 'gang rapes'.

Almost all the 21 members of the group have been identified. They will be examined.

Owing to the lockdown, the 15-year-old apprehended has not yet been produced before the juvenile justice (JJ) board, this report says.

The boy is said to have told counsellors and police that he was added by a classmate to the group during the last week of March.

After some days, they added a total of 51 people to their group and also made another group. Some of them allegedly started sharing photos posted by girls on their Instagram accounts. Some allegedly shared morphed photos as well, the Indian Express report quotes an officer saying.

Deccan Herald says in its report that the Cyber Cell had filed an FIR in the case under sections 67, 67(A) of the Information Technology Act, and other IPC Sections. The case was filed on 4",0

This is very true. I left academia after my PhD, and that was in hard sciences. But I could see how people are holding onto research themes that make no sense, just because they get funding for it. If they were funded by private corporations, they would long have been gone.   


The word kafkaesque you used is spot on. What has been human's strength since the dawn of  ages is the collaboration between more pragmatic, ambitious, cold-blooded, rational man and the more intuitive, maternal, empathic, emotional and less rational woman. Each trait on each gender can be seen as positive or negative, but they each contribute to a certain balance.  


Starting to say that not just knowledge, but in fact the whole rational scientific method are 'oppressive', is one of the most self-destructive ideas that our society could have. Sure - we can't measure everything and see things black/white all the time (as men tend to), but we can't rule a society on hunches and beliefs either (as women tend to).",1

being homosexual. being terrorists and dislike or disrespect people are more
criminal act than being gay. why you islam don't accept that, you only making
mess all around the world about this matter. don't you have lots of muslim
brothers who are gay around this world ?? why you hate and reject them, this
is criminal. if god against homosexuality he would not create gay people, it

I *wish* that my *only* problem with ugliness was the lack of success with women. I found many copes like vidya, movies, and dog to cope with loneliness. It's painful to be alone but it's possible to go on. 

But bullying absolutely destroys my mentality and will to live. It happens almost weekly. I've developed social anxiety, and depression. I cannot go outside feeling safe. I have missed all my lectures in the past 3 months and when I did go outside, I was met with more bullying. I cannot do my favorite sport, I can't even go shopping because I will be met with smirks and looks of disgust. This is the life of ugly man. 

*Who are the bullies?* It's mostly women - educated medical students that will soon become doctors. *What do they say?* Mostly ""eew"", ""hell no"", ""he is ugly""....

For instance, last Wednesday we had an exam. I was standing in line with earphones when I hear an ""eew"" and then 4 girls in front turned around and looked at my face with spite.

5021,5022,"I agree with you but let me lay out the problem as I see it:

The problem is popular advocacy wants the best of both of these worlds frequently. 

Oh this is a situation where men are outperforming without involvement? Lets redistribute the success! Equality of outcome!

Oh this is a situation where women are outperforming men? Well hands off! Freedom to choose! Freedom of association etc! 

The issue I have is when you are here defending things with freedom of choice and another person defends stuff with equality of outcome . Sometimes both are used by people who only care about womens interest and they either dont understand or act maliciously about how its discriminatory against men.

I would select equality of oppurtunity by the way. I am actually against Title IX existing, but that means I would want everything it affects including sports to be undone. I would like everything judged by that same standard.

The problem is we have lots of areas where we have redistributive policies which benefit women and areas where women have more rights and/or outperform that should arguably be distributed.

Some examples of redistributive equality policies that benefit women or tend to benefit more women: quotas, child support, Alimony, sports payment/scholarships, marriage/divorce laws, female only programs, gym hours.

Some examples where women have an arguably better deal out of it without any other intervening policy: child custody, paternity laws, womens scholarships, draft, #believewomen, dating, power of sex appeal, FGM/MGM, spending gap

You can also list some redistributed policies that favor men (bathroom lines based on same size bathrooms in public)

You can also add non redistributed policies that people argue should be redistributed (Pay Gap, job career choices gap)



I could add more things to all 4 of these areas. The point is that it is common to see freedom of choice arguements made alongside redistributive ones. (See advocacy for my body my choice and compare it to wage gap). However I look at all these issues and notice that redistributive equality and equality of oppurtunity get men shafted on both ends of it currently, frequently. 

I see current advocacy as using both standards, combined. This is no longer equality but a way to use equality as an arguement of convenience to argue for something above equality.

So, when I argue Title IX, its not because I believe Title IX is the best thing ever, but because I am pointing out the lopsided tendency of advocacy that argues BOTH Outcome and Oppurtunity...picking whichever arguement is convient.

The goal should be to pick one standard and work towards it. Instead we have the bastardization or arguing as advocacy for women by any standard that can possibly be used to support the arguement.

This is why I consider my flair to be the most important thing for advocacy in general. I am not anti woman or pro man.. I am advocating for a consistent standard.",0

The fact that we mostly read and discuss Western feminism is a part of the post colonial discourse. There is a still a soft culture in academia about the Western understanding of feminism. And the fact that we often feel alienated from the discussions in our home as well as overseas is because we dont take multitudes of lived realities into account. Even if we do, we dont hear much about it and its often exoticized and seen as something bizarre  in the West. Its so frustrating because women from third world countries are assumed to achieve the feminist discourse in the West. The cultural nuances are completely disregarded. The collective voices of women from the third world heard. There is need to engage with lived experiences of multitude of women from diverse cultures and classes. Patriarchy affects us all but it affects some more disproportionately than others. Feminism at the outset should account for this.

I agree, women really need to stop bending over backwards. I dont mind somewhat shorter men that I keep that to myself (the whole debacle is turning me off men shorter than me completely tbh but I'm a femcel so what I like doesn't matter lmao). All I say is that women are allowed to have preferences and it's the only thing I'll say.

I hear men going on and on about ""petite"" this and ""petite"" that. Blackpeopletwitter loves to make fun of ugly women but bring up short men in that thread and they get mad.

The infamous angry short man who claimed he couldn't get dates lied. He even recorded one of his many dates where he abandons a woman in the snow.

It's a power issue, they're have to accept that they're not rich Adonis' that all women lust over and get a hobby instead.

being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in

from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure

taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments

(romans 1 - new international version) ...... ""for since the creation of the
world god’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been
clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are
without excuse.  
  
21 for although they knew god, they neither glorified him as god nor gave
thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were
darkened. 22 although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and
exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like a mortal
human being and birds and animals and reptiles.  
  
24 therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to
sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 they
exchanged the truth about god for a lie, and worshiped and served created
things rather than the creator—who is forever praised. amen.  
  
26 because of this, god gave them over to shameful lusts. even their women
exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 in the same way the
men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust
for one another. men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in
themselves the due penalty for their error. furthermore, just as they did not
think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god, so god gave them over to a
depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. although they know
god’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not
only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice
them."" .... and this one, you can put wherever you want ....... who said that,

It says:

*How do we not lose hope in finding love? How do you tell yourself that the right guy will come along when you don't really believe it? Why do you not believe that it could happen for you? Regardless of the insanity that we see out there today, love happens. People get married. People move in together. These things happen all the time. You don't have to be young, or beautiful, \[rich, famous\], in shape, enough to offer, or have a good credit score. If love happens for this one or for that one then it is possible for me. Whatever we have lived up to in our past, it does not indicate our future. You may want to revisit choices that you dismissed in the past.*

In the comments below the video, you can find an excerpt from the the despair of women over 25 (and certainly over 30):

*Im 46 years old and it has never happened for me.*

*Its really hard to believe love can happen for me when I have been waiting for so long. Its been 12 years since my divorce, and I am losing hope.*

*It has been 20 years since my divorce.  I've been with several dating agencies, and only had a couple of short - term relationships which have never lasted beyond a few weeks/months.  Just one that lasted about 15 months, but he turned out to be an alcoholic.  I've had a couple of dates just recently, but all he wanted was a friend ""with benefits"" .  I will be 70 this year so just want someone who will prove his worth before anything like that happens.  I'm not as confident about my body, as I was years ago.*

*Im a very affectionate caring loving women aged 35 , men tell me Im attractive all the time.  But I meet a guy we start to date , we get on great he says hes so crazy about me & finds me so attractive & caring and with in a few weeks( longest being 6 mths )the man says he doesnt want commitment & has no feelings for me . This has happen to me about 20 times over the past 15 years. So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it.*

*Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?*

I think that the lesson for women is quite simple.

Either they find a husband while still in their prime age, or else, they will soon end up in a desperate situation.

Of course, that does not change anything on the male side, which first and foremost may want to stay away from the gynocentric court system. So, if a woman is young and pretty, she may still be able convince a younger man, who at that point is still governed by his hormones, to ignore his red-pill lessons and sign up anyway, for a stint on the plantation. Older women are mostly toast, while the video tries to give them hope that they are not (but they do not seem to believe it, really).",0

2524,2525,"How To AMOG Beta MalesIt shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.

Steel's Guide to Married Red Pill  It will be a long journey for a career beta like me.

MRP Beginner's Guide for the Career Beta  I want to read again in a few months and be proud of how far I have gone.

Currently reading: not really reading, just latest posts in MRP and askMRP, I have too much things to do to catch up with my goals  

Reading queue:

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius  I kind of like stoicism. Getting worried about mundane things is like when a small baby have a tantrum over a random toy.

Audiobooks:

TWOTSM  I followed HornsOfApathys advice and I am listening to audiobooks while training. Book is inspiring, too deep/god focused, maybe I am still not ready, but I am enjoying the explanations.

**Myself:**

Confinement. Routine. Wake up. Kids tasks. Cook. Work tasks. Food. Train or not. Projects or laziness in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Hey, I built a wall. No, not an emotional wall you feelings-porn-seeker, a real one with bricks and mortar. For being a first time I feel really proud. I build things. I am a man now.

For the DoD challenge, I keep working out, diet is not soo bad and of course I shower and shave every day you disgusting faggots! Keeping house a bit better, but I need to do some tasks none of my children (including wife) feel responsible for. They will. Because I will guide them.

I have been busy with myself. Changes and habits take some time to settle, so I did not feel like writing weekly. It might sound like an excuse, but I did not want to repeat myself. Still, from time to time is good to write down to keep the pulse (and get some kick in the ass from wiser men).  

I own that I need to improve with the kids. I could be better and schedule better and be stricter and plan better and guide better but they are kids and are trapped here, so I let them slip a bit from schedule and be kids. Still, there is room to improvement and I will go for it. A bit stricter in the mornings and more playful in the afternoons, that will be me.

Time is scarce due to the fact that I am supposed to be working and dealing with kiddos at the same time, and this is not possible. So I work afternoons after wife comes back from the job.

I am still searching for my mission. By listening TWOTSM I had to stop lifting for a few minutes and list all the shit I like to do, I want to do, and there are a lot of things, but no real legacy yet. Nothing tells me go for it, they are still a bunch of long-term things I want to do. I will choose some things and see if it brings me to a better sense of mission.  

**Current goals:**

* Reach 1000 lbs club: deadlifting heavy is the best feeling I have in life. I cannot explain it but if I had to do a personal record or fuck, I would go for deadlifting (iron oneitis?). Max 1RM theoretic calculations put me in 800. I will try when it says 1100.
* Play guitar. And sing. I will be a rock star. Yeah I also dont believe it, but it is fucking fun.
* Be consistent with my working, training, household, etc. I need to put it as a goal because being the best me is part of my mission.

**Relationship:**

I am surprised on how unemotional I have become regarding my relationship most of the time. No, really, not angry anymore, no fear or whatever. I was over-sensitized lately and jumping at every bone. I somehow dont care about many things that would have had me angry and emotional regarding the relationship. I kind of see shit tests and am sorry, what?, you expect me to react to that?. Old me would DEER and whine and justify and make things rational and explain and prove and try and on and on but new(TM?) me is kind of whatever IDNGAF. And the best is that I mean it. My relationship is still really important to me, but the explosions/situations of the moment are not interesting me at all.  

Too much shit to do to be bothered I guess I am now at 80% of the time with this attitude, 20% resentment. This 80% is not rambo, it includes  initiating, relaxed attitude dude this confinement has been a blessing in disguise for me. The 20% are still my insecurities and fears and still being angry for not getting the treatment I deserve and fuck the noise, I just STFU and it disappears after some time. I am kind of relieved I am not in the emotional roller-coaster anymore.  

We are still not talking about us, but I am not sure I want to taaaaalk anymore. We share time together, play with the children, have some interesting non-relationship conversations, watch some serial together, pair of sexy times a week (I want more, and I dont get butthurt when rejected most of the time)... a standard blueish relationship. If she is fucking around or hiding things/lying is her fucking problem, fuck her (I still have oneitis, so I am trying to fake it until I make it). Not where I want to be, but far better than before. I take my time for myself and she is not the center of the universe, the center of the universe is again that marvelous land called Fraggle Rock or me, better me.  

**Lifting:**

\#60DoD  Weights are improving. I was lying to myself in the first OYS about my weights, this is where I though I was. Well, I was not close, I injured myself because I was too proud to lower the weights and do proper form, recovered and now my lifts are where I really am, proper form and at a minimum x5. I am fine with that and getting in a good shape.  

Doing Phraks Greyskull LP Variant and adding some shoulder and back exercises alternating days, plus some abs.  

Still a bit of fat, but I look better in pictures than two months ago. I had not decided in my last OYS if reducing body fat or going for increasing strength. I will go for the strength, I felt miserable when I tried to cut calories. And the mirror shows me a better body now, so even at the same BF% there is a huge difference.

**Diet & habits:**

I feel better and more energetic when I eat in a surplus. I will not go go-mad, but will keep calories high for now.  

I stopped cigarettes completely. They are disgusting now. Weed is reduced to evenings with wife, but I am also cutting that from last night (not even a goodbye joint, I stopped already). I dont drink, so I will go back to weed for recreational purposes, but I need at least a full clean month before considering that for now.  

I have enough rest, but I am not sleeping my 8 hours. I need to schedule myself better now that I am really doing things.  

**Financial:**

We share expenses. No change here. I started to do projects with the computer. Nothing that can create money yet, but the skills I need to build them will put me on the right track.

**Social:**

3836,3837,"If you improve youself so much, why would you need a girl?This is a very genuine question.   
Game theory aside, you'll find that one of the most recommended advises on the seduction community is to work on yourself instead of chasing women. Hell, learning about seduction and game is in itself self improvment. 

From my experience. I have reached states where I was very, very mature. I was neither angry nor impatient nor insecure nor needy. I was confident, calm, smooth, rational, fun but not forcibely, everything was so genuine about me, and I felt totally in synch with myself.  

What I noticed about those moments, aside from the inner peace I had. Is that people just followed me. If I was with a girl then seducing her was not necessary, Hell I didn't have to talk or say anything, I could sit there with a girl totally silent and somehow I could feel that she's enjoying my company. Same with guys. And when I said let's go there or do that and I lead, they just followed, no questions asked, no ""Why!! we can't, it's better to do that and that"" It was a great feeling. But I am unable to stay in that state for very long.   


This made me wonder, if I improve myself to the point where I'm in that state most of them time, what would I need girls for apart from sex? I mean everybody will talk about not being needy when you want a girl, but if you're not needy and abundant, why would you need her?

You  are going to grow up so, so resilient in ways that these kids will not.  It hurts and I know it's barely any comfort, but honestly, you are  going to be /so/ prepared for the knock-backs in life. You're having to  claw your way into recognition and being taken seriously - what happens  to these pretty people when that starts to fade?

One  of the biggest lessons I've had to teach myself (more due to abusive  father/controlling dynamics, but same theory applies) is to be  warm-blooded, not cold-blooded.

Cold-blooded  people need constant validation from those around them - they seek it  to warm themselves, they're always yearning for what others can give  them. Warm-blooded people find validation and comfort within themselves,  they understand their value and radiate with it, they don't need  outside comforts or input.

Focus  on your own personal goals and you can still have a great life. I live  alone in an apartment right next to work and it's a dream come true, I  work in a field I'm passionate about and have so much spare time to  pursue my hobbies. I'm taken seriously because I've had to force myself  to be, and people know I definitely got where I am based on  achievements.",0

6437,6438,"I would say you have three possible options. Rookie, intermediate, and advanced. Which option you choose is strictly up to your level of confidence. 

Rookie: pick her up from work and when you see the guy, just give him a stare. Say nothing. Give him a handshake and crush his hand during the handshake. Say ""is this the fat faggot you were telling me about?"" This path is a little insecure but if fatty is a pussy he will fuck off

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time. If she is chasing your validation she won't give a fuck about her faggy coworker. Flirting is fun and females love attention. If you're giving her too much attention it won't mean anything to her and she will seek it thru other sources. Dread game is goat.

Believe me. I was one of them. I started to look at my own mental processes and condition myself to find short men attractive. Not gonna do that.

3891,3892,"Western Society was built because of the culture of monogamy where the bottom 80% of men made major contributions. These contributions were made in exchange for access to reproduction they wouldnt normally have access to (due to socially enforced monogamy, religion, patriarchy) 

If majority of men truly become incel, society will crumble and devolve back to the days when the 80/20 rule was even more apparent 8000 years ago when [17 women reproduced for every 1 man](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success)

Women's mating strategies/preferences are not selected for advanced societies. They select for muscles,  broad shoulders, height, jawline - traits that were advantageous in ancient times rife with tribal warfare. They don't select for IQ which is necessary for advanced western civilizations

The feminist pipe dream is to revert to our primal mating strategies (for women) while retaining all the benefits provided by the unworthy masses of men giving rise to modern civilization. Good luck to them all.

A modern western society cannot exist when hypergamy is fully realized like 8000 years ago. Yes, muh lady will be more free but society will devolve",1
5554,5555,"Great post with usable tactics.

There should be a ""Tactics"" flair for these posts, versus ""Theory"" posts.

I never had trouble, generally speaking, with confidence. But all the little behavioral cues that society ingrained into me as ""right"" and ""correct"" had to be shed before I first really  felt the power of TRP. Even little Beta shit like saying ""sorry"" when I bump someone at the store. It all had to be shed, but it also had to be replaced with something.

And for me, anyway, it was finding and implementing the right *tactics* in place of all the bullshit that I was filled up with. So it's great to say ""do not give a fuck"" but how does that actually look in context.

What I find, much like V. reports, is that women will resort to overt communication if you're just nailing the tactics:

>**She flat out told me,** *I like to feel how strong you are.*

Overt communication in this context means you're doing it right.",0

4594,4595,"I dated a very successful woman and it was enjoyable. I also have male friends that would/have reacted the same way as you have described.

What worked for my relationship with the successful woman, is there was a sense of balance. Although she made more money than me. She'd ""allow"" (for lack of a better word) me to pay for things. I once had planned a trip for her birthday. I had bought tickets to a show and surprised her, but I hadn't purchased the plane tickets yet. We talked about it and decided she would pay for airfare and I would pay for the events, lodging, and majority of food. The trip was lovely.

Throughout the relationship we had made a deal. Whoever has the idea, pays. For example if she wants to go to breakfast, she pays. If I mention us going to a movie, I pay. Things like that. 

Although it isn't all about money. She also ""let"" me be dominant in the bedroom. It is important that men feel like we can be men. When a woman tries to stifle that or if we feel unable to provide. We end up lost.

There are many ways other than financial to provide for someone. The men you dated may have been intimidated/insecure of your success. But did you allow them to be men in other situations?

It's often small things. Letting us drive places, build things, take over in the bedroom, make decisions on what we do, etc. Even if you paid for majority of the things, we (men) need to feel some sense of control somewhere in the relationship. If you drive everywhere, if we always take your car, if you pay all the bills, buy all the food. It makes us feel unnecessary.",0

Meanwhile men have a laundry list of preferences, standards, and REQUIREMENTS for womens physical beauty. 

Some of their preferences are breast size/shape, nose size, WHR, hip width.

And the most common argument the short guys have is well you cant change height!! 1. You cant change the above things unless you are willing to risk your life, take time off from work and lose money, and drop >5k on implants or surgery, which guys shame you for anyways. 2. Why does it MATTER that you cant change your height? Ok? Should women immediately be sympathetic because you have an unfixable feature and start to have a preference for it? 

Its double standards. Im glad theres a feature for men to widespread be insecure about. Because women are picked apart and microscopically dissected for their features. Men dissect an oblivious woman walking by, with their friends as a social pastime. Its disgusting.

Back in the days, men would chase women and we were ready to do anything for you know what. Women would get annoyed by our horniness, and we would get accused of being only interested in sex. This is not happening anymore, and it is very distressing for women. It has considerably changed the balance of power. I have seen women in awe with my dick just because I could raise it, something which at any other time in history would have just been the normal. They would tell me of all their past dates that could not perform, and then they would just worship my dick and giving me anything I wanted just for being hard. Thats something I would not have seen 20 years ago. Sometimes, just being a bit bold and showing sexual interest is enough to get laid.

started, when it started and why it started. if kangana have accepted to do
movies with anurag, then taapsee wouldn't have got her got father and wouldn't
be that big month to attract kangana. kangana rejection has benefit to taapsee
so, she should be thankful to her rather attracting by saying she needs double

she felt kind of secured when anurag gave her a job back to back, and she felt
why not i took that opportunity to attract kangana so, that movie mafia gang
will be delighted and get job form them , which every actress wishes for. just
being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in
karan's good book list. by attracting kangana is the fastest way to get a job
from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure
hearted. so, taapsee use that tool intentionally. that is her strategy or plan
to get role from them.  
  
  
  
honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments
deals, but they never put outsider heroine on the top cuz that position only
belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia

5261,5262,"This mentality forever baffles me. Also, its makes highlighting those issues seem very reactionary. Those men issues are also very important, but if those men you describe reallly care about the problem, they will address it & try to solve it independently. Yet in my experience, men who bring up male rape victims as a dismissal of female rape victims are the ones who laugh at prison rape jokes & shame male victims as being weak. 

Feminists dont expect men to  lead the revolution for womens rights, so why do men (like the one described above) want feminists to lead the fight for mens rights? We can be allies for each others cause. This doesnt mean feminists dont advocate for men because we do; I make it a point to also address the inequality that men face. But I prioritize women issues & mainly address womens issues because I am a woman and it directly affects me.

Also, to answer OP, people want to justify their behavior by pointing out a nonexistent double standard. They want to believe that girls wouldnt be reprimanded for the same behavior & thus, they are being unfairly targeted. But either way regardless of gender, its wrong.",0

5604,5605,"Had my first date in 3 months. Accidentally blew my load in a minute - Can this be salvaged?Well boys - Have I got a story for y'all.  I welcome any words of advice, wisdom, or how to play this moving forward.

Like many of you, I've been in quarantine for the past 2 months. Finally, in the last 2 weeks, I decided to say fuck it and download Tinder again. Before that, I was doing some solid self-introspection, reading, home workouts, learning to trade options, no drinking, no weed, lots of meditation. All was well. I was feeling great!

During this time, I also stayed away from Porn and only jacked it once a week to no porn.

Fast forward to yesterday and I had my first outside date with a bird in that span of time. Super fucking cute, short Asian girl with amazing tits. I took her to my usual spot, which is this outdoor walking street with cafes and whatnot. We grab some cold drinks and start working around the area. All was going phenomenal with exceptional banter, kino, easy-flowing conversation, etc.

I said let's get outta here and we headed back to my place to 'watch a documentary' as that's what it said she liked to do in her profile.

We hung out on the couch, more kino, kissing, slowing escalating, she's getting wet and ready to go. It's getting to the point where she has to go home, but I take is LMR and just keep escalating.

Eventually, her dress on the floor and those gorgeous fucking tits are flopping around in my face.

We're both naked and eventually, I caveman carry her to my bed. We're still working up to sex, which is fine, so I flip her around and we start 69'ing.

Well here's where it all went to hell! After 2 months of quarantine, and not even having the chance to touch a bird, I fucking let myself accidentally get way over-excited, and as she's giving me the best head this side of 6 months - using her mouth in ways only god knows  - before you know it I'm shooting a giant premature fucking load in her mouth. I lasted maybe a minute. Not my proudest minute at that. I had no problem when she was jacking me off vigorously, but as soon as she went down on me, while I'm eating her out, I fucking lost it.

I haven't cum this fast in years.

To make matters worse, she jumps up and runs to the bathroom to spit out my spunk, just leaving me sitting there on the bed.  I mean, maybe she was surprised at my load, maybe I fucking hit the back of her throat. I don't fucking know.

She comes back out of the bathroom, and I try to play it off as if I'm just gonna finish her. I go down on her for a little bit longer and she says she needs to finally get home - it's 11:30 pm and she has to wake up at 7 am. I say cool and here's where she proceeds to give me the ego dick punch of death. ""Oh - you came so fast"" in what can only be described as a disappointing tone.

I wasn't quick enough on my feet to come up with a good line, but I also didn't fucking show emotion either. I just played it off to quarantine and not having any action in a while. Just like it was no big deal, and just hoping it was a shit-test. So many other things I could have said, trust me I know. But the damage was done and my ego lay in tiny fucking shards all over the floor.

So boys - what do you think? Any chance of salvaging this. I feel like there's no fucking way I'm gonna contact her now. Gonna just have to wait for her.  And if she does contact, I'll just never bring it up again like it never even happened. Again - every other part of the date was great. I actually enjoyed conversing with her. That is the first time in a while.

Thing is, I've got 3 more dates lined up with 3 different birds this week alone, but I'll be dammed if my ego won't let me forget this performance. Of course, I want the revenge fuck now to show her what I can really do in bed.

What do you think lads?

**Edit #1**: She literally just reached out asking for some innocuous link to another documentary I had mentioned. If she really wanted to ghost, she wouldn't have contacted at all, I think.

**Edit #2:** Lads, you're all legends! Cheers for the solid advice from all of you. I truly appreciate it. Some hard lessons to learn, but that's all part of the process.

As a consensus: DGAF Attitude, Amused Mastery, Ego is the Enemy, Better Psychological Stimulation, and Eat that Pussy Better are the lessons learned. Just been a little outta practice. Quarantine does weird shit to the social skills. But it will all come back. On to the next one!",1

Eye contact

Greet

Small Talk

Farewell/Contact Info

Get out of your head, be in the present moment, and pay attention to your environment and the person in front of you.

Eye contact is how women convey interest.  If she locks eye contact with you, chances are she's interested enough to at least talk to you.  Master eye contact and you'll notice you're having more and more success with women.

Greetings are very natural and gives off a warm vibe.  Don't try to sound sexy or cool.  A ""good morning"" with good eye contact will get you better results than trying to be funny, interesting or cool.  Especially if you see the person frequently.

Small talk is when you can throw in your wittiness.

Her: ""Every time I see you you're drinking coffee""

You: ""So how long have you had your eye on me?"" said with a smile.

Don't expect fireworks, just observe her reaction.

Farewells don't require a hug or a kiss.  I know ""kiss closing"" is your goal, but you could kiss somebody today and she could be kissing someone new tomorrow.  It's not an accomplishment.  If you want to speak to her again, just get her social media info or phone number.  With social media, you can see what kind of person she is a little more.  You'll know if it has the potential to go further than a one-night stand or not if you actually do get to fuck.

I have to admit, the results have been life changing.

This all happened last 48 hours

First off, a lot of women stare, and for much longer. The first women was on a date with a guy at a bar, and in-between small talk with the guy  I had to go to the bathroom. Well, there are mirrors that I can see him and his date as I walk away either direction, and all I saw was this guy's date have the most memorizing stare I've seen on a girl. Right in front of him. Nothing held back. Beautiful girl btw, but I'm not a terrible person, so I would never encourage guy hopping while on a date. The look gave that ""this guy is so interesting"". They haven't been dating long it turns out.

On the same night, a more heavy set girl and her friend stand behind me at the bar. I look behind me, and I see two genuinely nice smiles. I'm not into bigger women, personally, but I still found it really nice.

One coworker checked me out from head to toe with a smile, and a 2nd coworker is straight up looking to rebound her break up by putting a lot of really cute effort into being close to me, and having me notice her. She does these really attractive/confident stare with a smile. Did a little small talk, but the sexual tension was so intense. I might actually be down for what she's looking for. I actually really liked her sway when she  walked passed me for no reason and then looked back at me to see if I noticed her. Her flirt was up to 11.

 last night, at the bars and club, another heavy girl flat out put my friend down because she thought he was ugly and I was attractive, and said she was down to fuck. That one pissed me off. So I shut her down by letting her know she's shitty. I leave to a new bar, and IMMEDIATELY, a wicked cutie hits on me which I assume is a one nighter she's looking for. I fucked that one up because I was so caught off guard, and ended up saying things that sounded like I was rejecting her. (Oops). I wasn't thinking before I spoke, so I ended up saying things that made her feel hurt.

Finally, my male friend straight up told me I was clearly a really good looking guy. This one felt so nice, because he's a really good dude, and straight men don't normally tell me that. (Bless you)

The rate of attention I got wasn't anywhere close to this before I decided to actually look confident. I also feel more powerful. I'm 6'4, and now look properly strong. Mentally and physically, girls and guy notice my vibe, and want to be around it.

So now it's day three, and about to go to work. And make the bar after. Based on all the attention with my new posture, I look forward to how people will treat me.

Update: at the bar right now. Haven't been looking around much, but have caught two 8s stealing glaces. One of them double takes and held the stare for a long time. Not sure how else to explain this shit.",0

3251,3252,"So, just like rape culture, and the other things in this series, I'm going to make the same complaint. I think it's impossible to ""falsify"" hypergamy. I don't think it's something that exists universally in our world. I think there are clusters that have factors and pressures that make it worse than in other places (and vice versa, really) 

Certainly, I don't think every woman follows that sort of hypergamy path. Maybe most don't. I don't know. But I wouldn't say it's NEVER the case. Because that's obviously not true. And certainly, I've seen and heard about social pressures that actually serve to make hypergamy more expected behavior. 

I think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal. It's FAR from universal. 

Again, the best we can do is look at local factors. That's probably the best information  we can use on these topics.",0

Now that this  quarantine is in full motion I can see just how foreign it is for a lot of people to be socially isolated. Whereas for me it's pretty much been my reality for the past couple of years now. I wish I could have a good friend that geniunely wants to spend time with me, but it's unlikely now. 

Anytime in the past that I've managed to befriend someone, they dump me for a newer, shinier model. And I'm just left to wallow in my own misery. It's painful, and I go through the motions of thinking what did I do wrong, why me etc. But that doesn't help and to be honest, they were never very good friends anyway. Like you mentioned I'd also invest more in the friendship than they did.

I still feel a pang of sadness at times, and there's only so much isolation one can take before you descend into madness, but I can't deal with the bullshit anymore. I desire friendship, but I want to feel wanted in my future friendships. If they ever come to fruition. It's a very tumultuous and painful place my mind is in.",0

4836,4837,"How I succeeded in datingAfter reading a lot of hoopla on inner game, flirting and other BS that there is out there, I came to an undeniable conclusion that most of these were full of shit. Sure, you could learn something of value from there, but most of it BS. So, I started using my common sense and got success.

I started working out. Not just because I wanted to date hot girls, but because I wanted to improve my health. This after having a fatal hospitalisation due to liver swelling. I improved my diet, which was now balanced and vegetarian. I did eat boiled eggs for breakfast though. And, I started working out. Hired a trainer and started finally. There were many points in time where I simply wanted to run away from gym and sleep in my cozy bed. It was painful, but worth it in the end. Now, for a year I have not been sick. Not even a cold.

Secondly, I started visiting a good barber. I can't emphasise how important is having a good hair cut. After getting my haircut, I kept going to the same since it is important to go to the same barber for maintaining a good hairstyle. I have specs so I bought a stylish pair of eyewear.

Thirdly, I improved my fashion sense. I started taking my female friends for shopping my clothes. If you want to attract females, better ask them what suits you. Besides, they have a much better fashion sense than males.

Meanwhile, while executing all this, I started socialising. Like just going out there. Started chatting up any girls that I liked. Initially, I had nerves. I was frantic, nervous. But gradually I started gaining confidence. I read somewhere that when girls reject you, think of it as their loss instead of yours. Initially, I will be honest, I got depressed upon rejection. It shattered my confidence, but I kept at it. I had to. And eventually, this benefited me. I became desensitised to rejection. Whenever I got rejected, I got a bit sad but moved on. 

Then after some time, I finally got success. Hence my confidence increased. But a big part of it was me getting fit. I cannot emphasise the importance of what being fit did to my confidence. No longer had a pot belly. No longer was I skinny. So I would say this, going to gym and being fit will boost your confidence enormously. You do not need to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Just be fit. Muscular. Don't go overboard with it, lol.

Another thing that has kept me happy in the relationships is:-

* I do not dip my pen in crazy ink.
* No games. No push pull. Be genuinely busy. Develop constructive hobbies. Develop interests. Be an interesting person for the sake of living fullfiling life. Not to get chicks.
* Never pursued a girl that was playing games. I have my self respect intact. No girl is worth losing it. I have a rule about dating. If after first date, the girl does not herself ask for another date or start a conversation, I consider it to be the end of it. Never drive single handedly. After some time if a girl is not reciprocating, or is confused. I tell them to make up their mind.
* Be forth coming once you start dating about what you want. No pussyfooting about what you want. Do not be friends if you are attracted. You will end up suffering.
* Do not be manipulative. Do not put a nice guy act. Girls can see through it within seconds. They might end up using you and then dumping you before you get anything.
* Do not stalk. Do not be pathetic. No means no. Develop a thick skin and learn to move on.

I have to make some diet changes due to blood pressure rising again. Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast.

Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy.

**Mindset**

After working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various ""victim"" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long.

**Relationship**

Wife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU.

Intro

Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. 

Body

>Good seduction competently follows Mysterys attraction, comfort, escalation model and so lay reports tend to get repetitious. Im much more interested in the principles of game that you can use repeatedly to get ongoing results than any one particular story.

>Knowing the underlying principles means you can get repeat results. Recently I pulled together a threesome with my main girl and a new one I met, and taking RPDs excellent advice I wanted to write this lay report to crystallize for myself what I did right while my thoughts are fresh. I intend to do more of these in the future.

There are a number of takeaways

>Set the frame from the first time you meet a girl that youre a sexual, non-judgmental guy. Plant the seed with women you date as part of your sexual dirty talk that a threesome would be fun for you and her to enjoy together.

>When pitching the actual threesome date to a girl you dont know well, be indirect. Instead just suggest another friend joins for a drink or that you hang out at your place. Give girls plausible deniability.

>Threesomes take even stronger leading than a normal 1:1 date. You as the man have to lead the girls through the entire process.

Conclusion

Threesomes are fun but tricky. 

How this benefits the community

Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. If you are a guy and you want a threesome, then this is a guide to help you make that happen. Most guys have no idea how to make this happen so it's nice to see someone who does.

6090,6091,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

It may not mean to hurt the person, but purposefully making someone else sad does hurt them and it taints their entire day

721,722,"My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.

It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.

The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". 

Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. 

I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.

TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",1

Long answer, I moved countries so I do not know if my experience is relevant.

This is not because I disagree with the principle but sometimes with the solutions. While feminism is a global movement, solutions need to take into account the specificity of local culture and history.

Therefore, when a marriage is breaking up at the insistence of either the breadwinning wife or the supported husband, the lawyer has to apprise the client that when a big-earner wife comes in, the court bends over backward to be gender-neutral, and it is possible the bum is going to be rewarded for sitting on his hands. You do a flip-flop and make believe she is a guy.

Simply put: In order for a man to be happy and at peace, he must have a presently unattainable goal.


------


Let's jump right into it. Your personal deficiencies are going to be very different from the other guy (and your past self as you grow up and evolve). To expound on the second point, what I cared about at 17 was of the utmost importance to me at 17, but has no relevance to me now. Likewise, my expectation of achieving the goals I set for present-day me would be outrageous at that time.

That means in plain English that my mission in life at 17 was as follows:

* Graduate high school
* Hold on to the relationship with my girlfriend

My unattainable at 17 was:

* Get into my ""dream"" college  

When the unattainable is achieved, something new must take its place. **Failure to do this creates existential agony until an appropriate obstacle is in place to calm that nerve once again**. What do I do now when I achieve what felt like the unattainable? I invent a new unattainable. However, this lesson took some time to learn.

My college mission was as follows:

* Break up with high school girlfriend
* Make grades
* Rush the fraternity I wanted to be in

My unattainable at the time was as follows:


* 


Yep, nothing. This is where my journey stalled. I never bothered to think past my last unattainable into a new one! After all, I had already done the impossible. I was perfect and needed no further improvement in my mind.

I briefly got back together with the high school girlfriend long distance. It was, as my football coach put it, an ""other than positive experience"". See the problem?

----

This applies to men of literally any age. I use a teenage example because it will resonate with boys and men alike, but the message is the same: whether your limitations are sex, money, power, wealth (believe me, that is different than money), or fame (a thing many people hamster into attaining the other 4 aforementioned), you need to understand that without some seemingly unattainable goal to strive for you will never continue to be a man.


The core act of being a man involves becoming a different man worthy of surpassing self-defined milestones. The unattainable should be a combination of ""a thing you've never done before and have limited hope of achieving RIGHT NOW"" and ""things men you admire and respect have done before"". 

Fortunately for our dear readers, many are probably major losers right now. This unattainable can be as low as ""kiss a new girl"" or ""earn a promotion / earn $46,575 a year"". THIS IS A GOOD THING. Your self-actualization depends on actually achieving these goals, *just not in your current mindset, body, or frame.*

For the avoidance of confusion, your current mission should be:

1. Specific
2. Measurable
3. Attainable
4. Relevant 
5. Timely

Your current unattainable may or may not be any of these things - you have the freedom to decide. The only requirement is that the unattainable must be grand enough that you are currently unworthy. Hold yourself to this principle, and you will evolve rapidly into the man you want to be.",0

This makes me kinda out of my zone if you get me, I know it's as simple as ""let me kiss you"" (i tried and it works) but her ""coldness"" just sort of pushes me away and I end up sitting next to her wishing I was instead with a friend smoking a joint.

It's nice, but once you see how much friendlier people are to you when they assume you're decent-looking you can never go back... Still worth it, IMO. 

Unfortunately, as you've probably realised, it's pretty much impossible to find genuine friends when you're trying. (Decent-looking people don't need to try, so never realise this LOL.) Best thing to do is try and improve your alone time, and dose yourself with bits of social contact (family, internet, etc.) for basic survival. 

If you're seriously desperate for some one-off social contact, talking about random shit in the Omegle spy question mode kept me above water for a long time. You just have to go through a lot of bots.

3813,3814,"**OYS 17**: Mid 30s, 6 186lb, \~12%BF (Navy method), Separated, one kid 3yrs (f)

**Week Goals**

* One meditation session 20min  did three.
* 10 min meditation per day  4/7
* Actively reject guilt associated with ex  getting rid of this. Boundaries are what will progress me forwards.
* Stick to boundaries  9/10 did well here.
* Mobility taking some time off then will reset.
* Four morning walks  4/4 I think these are good for getting going in the morning.

**Reading:** NMMNG, MMSLP, Pook, MAP, Side Bar, Unchained male, models, The Eagle and the Dragon, WOTSM, WISNIFG, The dating playbook for men, The subtle art of not giving a fuck, The Rational Male, Awareness, Meditation Book (40%), NMMNG (35%), Stop walking on eggshells (50%). Sidebar.

**Mission:**

* Win each day.

Be a man I respect. A man of strength, courage and wisdom.

**Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.*

* Have used slightly higher does of sleeping tablets this week when stress was high.
* Run to burn off energy/stress.
* Weights three times.
* Seem to be putting on some muscle, not sure if its t-cream or increased calories.
* Had to take a break from all strengthening exercises for knee, ongoing pain since I pushed too hard which is disappointing as I thought it was getting better. Ill give it a few more days off then reset.

**Separation:**

* Ex reacted as I predicted to a letter from my lawyer. Im in a difficult position, she has just stopped allowing overnights for bullshit reasons. If I push it I wont see my daughter at all until I get an urgent court application (assuming I do at this time). If I dont push it she feels like she has won and will be encouraged to do this in the future. I have talked to lawyers (two to triangulate what Im being told)  Im finding the whole thing extremely frustrating. I dropped daughter off the other day and ex brought it all up in front of her. I said dont talk about it in front of daughter and she kept going at me while I got in car and drove off.
* So what am I doing  firstly I stopped. I was getting caught up in ego, then I considered a proper time perspective, in 2 years this will all be locked down legally and Ill have most of what I want. So, while it is frustrating and I want to do something the right play is to wait it out (mediation) then have an urgent application ready to go. I will not stop the money during this time although I legally could, it would look like Im retaliating. Previously I had in my mission (and it came back this week because I felt like writing it) Be a man I respect that man would see the frustration and let it pass over him, he would not react to petty ego games to get a short term ego win at the expense of what he really wants in the medium term. He would not forget to think about 2 years from now because something is happening 2 minutes from now. So that is what Im doing, its frustrating but I am going to do what needs to be done to get the best long term outcome.

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

* I feel better than I have in as long as I can remember. Ex is being annoying but I am in a strong position because I have done the work to get myself here. Life is only going to get better because Im going to keep doing the work to make it better. Im doing things that I want to do and am starting to craft a vision rather than just letting life happen to me.
* Still struggling with the tension of doing what I want and feeling good in the moment and doing what I should do which would progress me towards my goals but does not feel good and goes against some internal resistance.
* Following [u/Tyred\_Biggums](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyred_Biggums/) comment last week I have been thinking about Shame/needy partners and selfishness. Im not sure what I want to do for me, I did the NMMNG activity on this and have a few items. Most of these dont raise any issues e.g. I want to do a rally driving course and probably will. But there are a few that get to other issues. One is own a nice car, buying myself a nice car seems selfish because you could spend that money on the greater good. Im not sure 100% where this comes from but my parents have a part. I imagine my dad being disappointed in my decision. Im clearly still not living in my own frame if Im worried about things like that in the first place. Also, looking at shame and picking needy women I think they are two separate issues that feed into each other. I pick needy women because it makes me feel safe, they need me and so I dont have to worry. I feel shame because I feel like having any needs is wrong and will result in love being taken away, I am defective just by having needs. This feels so typical nice guy that I kept looking for something else but that is what it is. I try to have no needs, I dont inconvenience, I am always trying to do the right thing, when you combine that with picking a needy women and a fear of being alone you get my relationships and my codependency issues.
* Im not sure why I am so worried about being lonely/alone. Sometimes I find MRP very nihilistic and feel empty, Im still not sure what to replace that with. I go camping on my own quite a bit and feel happy and fine when Im doing that but with others I still chase something from that connection that I cant ever get. I need to spend more time thinking about this. Or maybe I dont, maybe I just want to have a nice car a fuck a pair of 19 year olds Im not sure yet.

**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*

* Im concerned my ex is coaching our daughter to say she doesnt want to stay at my house. There have been a few things she has said that leads me to believe this.
* Im worried about exs mental state and the effect that is having on our daughter e.g. her picking up on the anxiety. She has had some tantrums lately, I just try and be there not making a big deal about it all and making sure she knows I love her.
* My plan is to be a stable and safe place where she is always welcome and loved. Im listening to more Janet Lansbury podcasts while I wait for the book to arrive. This is giving me a lot of material to work with.

**Shit to Own:**

* Used porn again to feel better  not sure if I should focus on cutting this now. Its not a huge problem and Im focusing on other things. Long term I will need to at least run periods without it.
* Still think about the relationship sometimes and indulge myself here. Second guessing my decision, thinking how maybe I could make it work etc.
* Scared of being alone.
* Not sure where to go next with my development. I have had that feeling a lot and will just keep pushing and see where I end up.",1

The reason I know that the people who push this idea are ""blind"" or really, inexperienced or just don't know what they're talking about, is because for most of these people, if they have a girlfriend and she's friends with this cool guy and she always hangs out with him, they recognize the possibility that she could cheat on them with him.

But why would you think that she could cheat if befriending a girl supposedly keeps a guy stuck in the friendzone?

Or do the ""rules"" somehow not apply to that guy but they do to you? 

Friendship doesn't put you in the friendzone. 

The friendzone comes as a consolation prize from a girl who rejects your sexual advances and it is also sometimes a way for the occasional girl who has issues to manipulate and take advantage of a guy.

Its not your friendliness that puts you in the friendzone. Its the lack of a girl's attraction for you that does.

You can be that cool guy that all the girls want. Don't listen to blind people who project their own insecurities onto you.

In it a man described stumbling upon on evidence that his LTR had cheated on him ruthlessly a couple years back. So what did he do? He dropped her instantly. Good move on his part. 

While I don't advocate snooping around emails and social media to dig up possible dirt I will say he did the right thing by confronting her and kicking her to the curb. 

However in his post someone dropped a comment titled ""Be like Pete"" and I clicked it. It took me to an archived post from 2016 on the Relationships sub in which a woman had posted that she got dumped for suggesting to her then BF that she was going to visit in an Ex in another country. 

[Read the post for yourself](https://archive.is/uULD2).. 

**Lessons learned:**  

\-Have abundance Mentality: Pete gave no fucks. He knew he could find another chick and didn't care about spending the last 6 months with her. It's easy to drop a girl for bad behavior if you have an abundance mindset aka the confidence in knowing you can easily find more woman. A beta in scarcity mindset would convince himself to keep a bad woman around for fear of being alone.

\-Never keep a woman in your life who would even suggest visiting an Ex. It's a huge red flag but she also tried to spin it on him saying he was abusive for not thinking she should do it.  

\-Men don't want to be friends with good looking women. She honestly thought her ex was just platonic and yet the moment she told him she got dumped he said ""great now we can bang."" (Paraphrasing that)

engaged and having a fiance persuades kabir from the hospital and ask him to
come to her apartment to have sex and when he comes and they gets intimate her

asks him to leave then kabir becomes a little irritated and acts aggressive in

I'm going to do what real men do. True story from the other day bro.

3280,3281,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to.

5718,5719,"great initiative. kudos. all sides need a voice to maintain balance of
judgement. but let's talk about most of the comments here that's like ' i take
this golden opportunity to give slippershot to feminists'. kindly tell me, are
feminists conspiring and encouraging women to file fake cases? how is this
even a logical inference.  
  
people hear about false cases and simply assume it's just women exacting
revenge or exhorting money. in reality, the reasons are so much more complex.  
  
majority of false cases (according to the delhi study) are filed by parents of
eloping daughters especially if the boy belongs to another community or
religion in order to end their relationship. and these cases were then deemed
false because of testimony of the girl involved.  
false cases with women doing out of revenge is really the least common type.
but people talking about false cases only zoom in on this type.  
  
truth is we don't really have much reliable post verdict data of all this.
there's only this one study that too conducted for delhi courts alone. we need
to press for more data and research of into this area (root causes) to amend
the rape laws in a way that's justifiable. one of the amendments i would
support is removing 'breach of promise of marriage'  
  
please understand increase in fake cases do not correspond to decrease in real
rape cases. according to nhfs and ncrb reports not even 1℅ of sexual assaults
even get reported. i have interracted with rape victims and inspite of all the
laws favoring women, victims still find it difficult to navigate the legal and
social system after a rape. they are very ofen shut up, threatened and shamed.
there's a systemic problem of underreporting of rape.  
  
often in an attempt to support false case victims, people end up undermining
the frequency and severity of rape in the process.  
  
it's a good thing, fake cases are coming to light and people are fighting for
justice where it's warranted. but a fight for more fair treatment of men need
not necessarily turn into a stupid fight against feminism.

3867,3868,"Why do so many women tolerate and even encourage casual sexism from their friends/boyfriendsI am a woman myself. I was sexually harassed by a guy in my campus and the entire incident was caught on CCTV cameras, so when I reported he was suspended but got off without any punishment by using a legal loophole in the campus rules.

Knowing this and the existence of this proof even having seen it themselves in some cases, I still see the same women becoming his friends and hanging out with him as if it's totally normal. 
He never apologized he denied the whole incident and then went ahead to spread rumours about me being a ""characterless"" woman, who was drunk and delusional.

Not just this, the popular girls here the ones that are considered nice and you know not problematic or feminist like me, are usually the ones who allow casual sexism, laugh at sexist jokes, and basically appease men. I have tried hanging out in these groups or been forced on several occasions, and I've been put off by the huge amount of shit that these girls are putting up with. And when I bring it up they make excuses and they say it's how boys are.

I'm sick and tired, I've never been able to have female friends, just a couple of them. I'm tired of the normalisation of this behaviour. Why would any woman play against her own team, why would she support molesters? Why are they so scared of even trying to understand what feminism stands for?

Edit: he was not someone who had more social capital at least within the sophisticated circles, also most of the women whose behaviour I'm questioning are themselves in better positions of power than the men they were trying to appease",0

3655,3656,"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and
I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect.",0

4917,4918,"With such people making such remarks, it is always interesting to ask then why, if such words are so critically important that they denote sexism (which is so incredibly linguistically illiterate it's astounding), is their movement named after women, which clearly must also be a sign of sexism, and everything they fight against, from patriarchy to manspreading, manterupting and toxic masculinity, is named after men. Aren't such words also likely to be internalized harmfuly by young boys the way ""mankind"" is going to be internalized harmfuly by young girls?

Of course all of it is neglecting the fact that the ""man"" in mankind was the term representing a human being, and has to do with the hand (""main"" in French, same root as manual) at the time where male humans were referenced as ""wereman"" (like it is still in werewolf) and female humans were referenced as ""wyfman"".

It can be argued that the disparition of the ""were"" in front of man has more to do with the fact that men are only valued for what they do in society, hence their unique role being fused with the ""hand"", the ""man"" that is used to describe a profession (like in fireman, policeman).

To argue that the ""man"" in English word refer to men and is sexist is illiterate, and also (ironically since it is feminists we are talking about"" completely American-centric. It forgets that there ever was other languages than English, and that English has shared and borrowed words from all sorts of languages, including in large parts Latin and French. 

It is as incredibly stupid as ""we call it history because it is his story"", when in fact, it comes from historia in Latin (where ""his"" isn't a thing) and it is more likely that the word ""story"" actually comes from a deformation of ""history"" than the other way around.

3860,3861,"> more likely to commit crimes

If you ask sociologists, it's about being more likely to be accused and sentenced for crimes. Also something about discrimination in the first place, and less verbal and social skills making them have more difficult time to defend themselves against accusation. Some will go on with religious beliefs about patriarchy and toxic masculinity.

If you ask evolutionary psychologists, it's about status and access to women, in other words men committing crimes for the benefit of women or for their positive attention.

Regardless, even normalized for the same crimes, out of the accused, men are disproportionally more often sentenced than women and out of the sentenced ones, they're getting harsher sentences than women. Men are also less likely to get any help and are discriminated against by the police when they're victims of crimes. It goes on and on, and the OP of the crossposted article has plenty of good sources, also see the bonus sources chapter.

&#x200B;

Hello Everyone,

I have just watched this documentary which tends to show the reality of this hookup culture particularly focusing on graduates celeberating spring break on florida beaches. Some particular examples I would like to quote,

""It is easier to find FWB than boyfriends"" (girl 1)

""Guys believe they are entitled to our bodies; there is almost this one guy in every party who try to rip off my clothes"" (girl 2)

""I had always felt pressure from woman magazines to look sexy for boys and engage in frequent sex to get the validation I wanted"" (girl 3)

""I have always felt pressurerized to lose my virginity"" (Guy 1)

""Sex is not about love anymore, its about pleasure only. I don't have to know a girl to get into her pants. Let me demonstrate you (goes to demonstrate it)... You see, its so easy, the more intoxicated she is, the more likely she will drop her panties"" (Guy 2)

""I have come with my girlfriend here and I don't mind if she hooks up somewhere \[lol a cuck\]"" (Guy 3)

I live in a conservative muslim country where sexual market is controlled and free sex is frowned upon but thanks to feminism it is quickly changing. I used to believe that I had a disadvantage by not being born into a western liberal country but I don't think its true anymore. Its not because the girls are magically better but its because feminism has still not been able to destroy the fabric of this society. A regulated sexual market is both good for men and women, women retain their pair bonding ability and men don't have to worry about being compared to past sexual partners. Its a win-win situation for almost everyone (almost). Most people confuse TRP with another form of seduction and alpha male to be just a fucking machine. However, the reality is that in a society having the concept of masculinity solely revolving around the number of sexual partners could (almost) never produce homely virgin girls (with few exceptoins). The rise of feminsim has seen the rise of pornification of society, single motherhood, divorce rates, false rape accusations and other social ills. Women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas. They love to masculinize themsleves in order to get the dose of power which they could never taste even if they do they shall never be content because a woman's satisfaction lies in her being protected by a man. Being alpha is not about banging numerous women, this may have been an advantage during the dark ages but we are no longer in the dark ages and sticking to this dogma may damage male pysche as well e.g. depressing over not losing one's virginity due to peer pressure instead of working towards worthwhile goals. Is Dan Brazalian more alpha than an anverage guy who is working towards his goal and fortunately have a stable unicorn?. Hence, we should modify who really is  Alpha male:

1. Always working on self improvment.
2. Protecting his children and women (unicorn exists in controlled sexual markets).
3. Resisting Feminism and porn culture.
4. Achieving goals.
5. (Add what you think is constructive).

The degeneration of western society and downfall of fatherhood shall continue to move on if something is not done against this hedonistic feminsim. Although men have taken advantage from this hook up culture but the price which we are paying is far bigger than what can be put into words.  Banging multiple women cannot make our lives better, yes there is a burst of pleasure but its not good long term. I don't think a hook up culture and controlled sexual markets can co-exist ever.

Most men here use TRP knowledge to get into panites which does work because we know the nature of women but to find a traditional homely women is almost impossible.  I utilize TRP knowledge to pass shit test of women and her attraction only grows when you pass her shit tests. I was one of the victims of plantation culture until I came to TRP and received salvation.

4495,4496,"The Second Arrow  Currently there's an interesting AMA featuring Dr. Laurie Santos, host of the happiness lab. One of her replies contained an old parable I'd learned years ago but had forgotten till I read that thread. For those that struggle with self confidence; insecurities and negative self talk; this was her reply;

*Thats a hard one, as I incorporate a lot of the tips I share with my students from meditation to exercise to trying to protect my time affluence.*

*But if I had to pick one, Id say the most important insight comes from the fact that that we can control our reactions to the bad situations in life. Its an insight that comes from the ancient stoics but also from the Buddhist parable of the second arrow. Which goes something like this Buddha asks his followers if its bad to get hit with an arrow when youre walking down the street, which they quicky agree it is. Then he asks if its worse to get hit with a second arrow. All the followers agree that yup, getting hit with two arrows would suck more. Buddha goes on to explain that the first arrow is our of our control thats all the bad stuff that happens to us in life. But the second arrow is our reaction to those bad events whether we get angry or upset and make things worse. That second arrow is always up to us.*

*And so Id say the biggest insight thats had a positive effect on my own life is NOT to hit myself with that second arrow.* - Dr Laurie Santos 

During my teens I grew up with fairly high expectations. At the time I was expected to work, excel at studies and then contribute wherever else I was required. It's a gruelling weight to bear when there's so much expectation. I was drinking with my uncles and cousins one time and after relaying my woes; one uncle told me not keep shooting myself with *the second arrow*. He then told that same story. At the time I had a deep seeded doubt that the path I was forced upon; I wasn't up to. Insecurities, self doubt and my negative internal dialogue were eroding my confidence. Gaining that perspective however, then applying it; changed my world view. It irrevocably changed my frame. 

We all face adversity. Frame; and the base of its strength comes from a choice. We don't have a choice getting shot with the first arrow; **but we CAN consciously chose not to shoot ourselves with the second arrow.**

4105,4106,"The Power Of Teasing - Building Major Sexual Desire In WomenWomen are not use to men rejecting or teasing them.  The hotter she is, the less likely a man has teased or rejected her.  As a matter of fact, if he has, this is the guy she finds the most intriguing.

""Why are you playing games with women""

This is a game that women play with men all the time.  When a man does it back to her, it disarms her.

I wrote a post called  [**How To Be Charismatic With Confidence Coming Out Of Your Pores**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/how-to-be-charismatic-with-confidence-coming-out-of-your-pores/) and it's with the elements I mention in that post and what I'm about to share with you is gonna give you an unfair advantage over your male competition when it comes to women.

So how do you tease a woman?  First and foremost, stop being thirsty to fuck.  Second, this is not teasing that goes nowhere.  The more you tease her, the more intrigued she becomes and the more she will keep you out of the friend zone.

Don't give a woman everything she wants.  When you give her everything she wants, she will start to get bored.  Keep your conversations short.  When the both of you hang out, she will enjoy your time so much more.  So if you only hang out with her for just 10-15 minutes at a time, the more she starts having feelings for you, the longer she's gonna want to spend time with you.

Her: ""What?  You have to leave?  You just got here!"" in a whiny voice.

You: ""Yeah.  I gotta go.  I have to leave for work tomorrow""

Her: ""Wanna spend the night?  I can wash what you're  wearing so you can have something clean for work tomorrow""

This is an example, don't expect this to happen exactly like this.  But you get the idea.  When a woman starts making accommodations for you to spend more time with her, she is doing what men want women to do when they ask her on a date.

Remember that women make time and switch things around for men they're attracted to.  The more desire you build up in her, the less resistance she'll have.  If she's suppose to hang out with her girls, she'll do it earlier or later to make time for you.

If you learn how to focus on building the desire in her, you won't have to worry about sleeping with her... she'll do her best to make sure that it's gonna happen.",1

Despite this, it continues to find a fanbase, as evidenced by its consistently high ranking on sites like Crunchyroll. **Here's a look at how one of today's worst anime has become one of its most popular.**

So the arguments seems to literally be ""I disagree with some of the supposed messages of this anime, so obviously it being popular makes no sense"".

>The controversial elements might actually be a boon for the show's popularity. Some viewers may seek out Shield Hero because of its taboo, almost risque reputation, while others might even sympathize with the protagonist. **This would justify the show's label as an ""incel fantasy,""** but it would also explain why **rampant criticism has failed to break the show's viewership.**

Weird how someone who might empathize with a character being wrongly maligned and mistreated by powerful social elements might not react positively to criticism revolving around how it's apparently *morally wrong* to ever portray a woman abusing societal expectations for personal gain.

There's a few limp-wrist complaints about generic anime tropes thrown in, but its pretty easy to tell the driving reason this dude hates Rising of the Shield Hero is because it was declared guilty of wrongthink for having an evil female character do something an evil female character would do, but those damn incel anime fans kept enjoying it anyway.",0

It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital
platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get
certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and
Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that
the news channels alone can provide.",0

>  
>There is this modern trend that traditional gender roles cause men  not to talk about this and that gender is a useless construct, but this  is far from true.  Its because most of us know if we come forward with  our issues, the people around us and society at large will largely shun  us. Therefore we bottle it in and deal with it by ourselves, not because  we are afraid of not looking like ""real men"" but because we know we are  alone in this struggle and if we open up we will lose so, so much.

My husband took nights on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) so I could actually sleep.  Do you absolutely have to keep pumping? Can you supplement with formula? 

You really need some self care.  There is nothing that says you never get a break just because you are a mom of a baby. In fact you really, really need a break.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  I realize theres a quarantine on and I dont know where you are - but even if you can go get a coffee and sit in the car with a book for 30 minutes.  

The thing is you have a ton of things going on here: you have an infant you is still at an age that is fully dependent on you.  You probably arent sleeping amazing. You are isolated because of a quarantine (along with the stress of that). You are essentially doing this alone (with some help from your husband).  

The infant is a full time job that never ends.  The house and being a homemaker is a full time job.  There isnt much time for leisure and building up your empty stores (you cannot pour from an empty cup).  Figure out what you need.  One day a week of sleeping in?  3 evenings where you can take a bath? Going out to get coffee? Calling a friend?  I cant answer the question for you.  But what you ARE doing isnt working.  Be specific and then tell your husband I really need sleep and I need one full night of sleep a week.  How can we make that happen? Or whatever it is that you need.  YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM FOR NEEDING THIS nor are you a bad wife.  You, my dear, are human.  

If after replenishing your stores you still dont like things that you used to enjoy - please talk to your doctor about it.  You could have Post Partum Depression.

Say Goodbye to Survival Mode by Crystal Paine

The transition into motherhood is a hard one.  I feel like as a society its supposed to be this 6 week - all the weight is gone, baby is sleeping all night.  Its okay that you arent okay right now.

Edit-cant believe I forgot this! My advice to all new moms (especially if you are struggling!) is to get outside as much as you can.  I realize it may be hard.  But if you can put baby in a stroller or a carrier and got for a short walk that can make a world of difference.  Even just sitting on the porch or a park bench can be very refreshing instead of being stuck inside all day.",0

3570,3571,"I moderate a large subreddit. Some time ago, we decided to stop letting people use gendered slurs entirely. No bitch, dick, or pussy. No whore, no slut, no man-ups, no man-child, no fuckboy. The results were the following: 

* A lot of people got mad about the policy (and still do)
* Everyone got nicer
* All the comments got more constructive
* The amount of whining about the gender double-standard went way, way down and people focused on these specifics of the situation. 

I honestly didn't expect this to work. Never in my dizziest daydreams did I think this would have much of an impact. But it *did* have an impact. I've actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why that might be. 

I think that when people use a gendered slur as shorthand and then you take it away from them, they won't rephrase it to the exact same level of vitriol because they don't necessarily mean *that thing they said*. When people stop being able to ask, ""Am I just being a bitch"" and have to ask the question another way, they typically don't go to the most derogatory counterexample. Rarely it is rephrased to ""am I just being angry and controlling for no reason"". They have to clarify what they think being a 'bitch' means, and that could be controlling, manipulative, assertive, mean-spirited, cruel, or crazy. I might also mean a better meaning like, ""Are my expectations unreasonable?"" or ""Am I asking too much to expect that my partner ___"". 

The way people respond to those two questions is dramatically different too. People often will echo ""Yes, you're a bitch"" back, but they will answer ""Am I being unreasonable"" with ""No, boundaries are important"". Gender bias plays out in this situation like you wouldn't believe. People who are disinclined to support a woman who might be being a ""bitch"" to their partner (even if the specifics of the situation are the exact same) will support respectful boundaries, clear communication, and taking responsibility in the next breath. Similarly, telling someone to man-up is actually really unclear advice. What does that mean? What does one *do* if they actually want to man-up? A large percentage of the time, that evolves into ""Sit down and have an honest conversation about your feelings"" which, I think you'll agree, is a weird definition of ""man-up"". 

What I find is that gendered slurs usually are a short-hand for a complex and largely unconsidered pile of baggage that everyone means and understands in their own way. You can still call someone an asshole, a piece of shit, a cheater, a loathsome creature, an emotional terrorist. You can still say terribly mean things about people without using gendered slurs. You actually don't say much when you tell someone to man-up, quit being a pussy, stop being a fuckboy. When you ask 35 people a day to reword that to make it something else, you realize that no one is really communicating with those words at all. They are just thought-terminating cliches for feelings people mostly never consider.",1

1027,1028,"Went to the bar on Valentines NightSo as the title says, I went to the bar on Valentines with my friend because Im a man looking to find a relationship or casual sex. Couldnt go into the bar because my friend forgot his ID. Classic. I decided to be a bro and stay outside with him and try to get lucky that way (I live in a big city so 1am hangouts outside the bar is a possibility). There were two instances where I had a chance.

1.) Theres this very attractive blonde girl about my height with heeled boots by herself on her phone. Time to shine. I walk up to her and say, excuse me! I introduce myself to her. She does the same to me. I tell her that I think she is a very attractive woman as well as that I would like to get to know her. She tells me Im very sweet with a cute puppy dog face and tells me that she has a boyfriend and that hes picking her up soon. I say thats okay and that Id love to be her friend, so I ask her for her number.

Que the boyfriend pulling up on a motorcycle and revving his engine for her to get on. She tells me thats him and I shake her hand as well as tell her it was nice to meet her and I walk away. About 3-5 minutes later I see the motorcycle drive off and same girl with other people hugging someone which appeared to be a friend, so I walk over to her and asked if she was just dumped to which she replies that shes just meeting him somewhere else. Looking back on that second encounter I feel stupid because I couldve said looks like I have a chance to get that number after all or something like that. Is there any other way I could have handled the second encounter?

2.) There was this other attractive brunette girl that kept exchanging looks with me, but I was too enveloped in a conversation with the group that I was interjecting myself in to go over there. Looking back I should have totally went over there for at least a moment. I was actually about to invite that girl into the group and she walked to the parking lot. How couldve I handled that differently?",0

5701,5702,"before women were suppressed by men.  
now men are suppressed by women.  
it's basic human nature if you give more power to anyone then that power will
eventually turn into evil.  
humans always try to take advantage.if they can suppress any one they will. so
every law should be made very carefully and loopholes must be fixed quickly.  
yes, woman are raped .that's bad and extreme punishment should be given to
anyone who rapes or tries to rape.  
but the harsh reality is that about 50% rape cases are false.  
they are in a relationship they have sex.that's normal.but the problem comes
when they break up. if it's a girl leaving a boy it's fine "" but"" if a boy
leaves a girl (breaks up with her) then that's a rape.  
a sex with both parties agreement is not a fucking rape.  
it's rape if you are forced to do it physically or be it mentally( harassment
/blackmail ).  
if a woman says ,""i did sex with him because he said he will marry her."" but
didn't marry because of some reasons. it does not show that man is a rapist
but rather it shows that she is a fucking gold-digger. he may be a fraud but
he is not a rapist.that's not rape.

5544,5545,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.

^2  Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever).  Dont over plan.

5867,5868,"How to double text? Don't give up too soonHi guys. I have been into seduction for a couple of years now. I am moderate by most standards. I know and read the most popular material (models etc.).

And once in a while I stumble on a detail about game that I haven't figured out.

In my first year I went by the 'hell yes hell no principle'. Thinking that if women flaked or did any sign of disinterest I moved on.

But now I have more experience I start to notice that it isn't this straight forward at all. I had a date for example where the girl wanted to leave. I turned it around and had a f close. Same with reinitiating  contact. Girl doesn't answer texts says she is busy but 2 months later we still hook up.

I was far too negative. Having a short fuse to think women aren't into me by the first sign of trouble.

Ofcourse if a girl is bothering me with her behavior I let it go. But if I am less insecure about it I just try again and to my suprise I often get what I want.

So I am thinking about the double text.

We are having a fun conversation. About equal investment. And than it stops. How do you approach this?

A woman who is interested in you will make it work to be with you. She'll want to be a part of your lifestyle as it is. If you meet a girl and then change everything in your life to be with her, she'll most likely leave. A woman wants to add to your life, she doesn't want to BE your life.",0

6094,6095,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

I think society functions best when the base assumption is everyone is entitled to being loved, having sex and enjoying at least one relationship.

I find it alarming that in a culture where we obsess about the health and welfare of the environment and animal kingdom, we care so little about each other and our collective mental health and happiness.

The superficiality and cruelty that define the dating market should be beneath the type of people we believe ourselves to be.

Incels of both genders should have access to legal prostitution and both men and women should be encouraged to be less shallow and more generous in their dealings with each other.

So many people now end opportunities for happiness because theyre not getting 100% of everything on their list, mostly women.

This dull, checklist-style approach to dating sucks all the fun out of interactions for both genders and leaves many on the sidelines who are good people and would make good partners if others could just get over their superficiality.

In short, I think the current state of dating is sad, cruel and shallow, and the idea that only the most shiniest people deserve love is a big reason behind it.",0

4318,4319,"TRP was meant for Average Frustrated Chumps not Bottom Tier Omegas**Who is the Average Frustrated Chump?**

The average frustrated chump aka our beloved beta has had a semi normal childhood. They know how to talk to people and make friends. They have a friend group that goes outs and meets girls. The average frustrated chumps has gotten girlfriends in the past and knows how to flirt(albeit badly). 

Our AFC is a 5.

The purpose of TRP was to teach 5's how to improve their looks to a 7.5 and how to act like a player.       
 It also teaches men to take women off the pedestal. 

Go to the gym, fix your wardrobe , get an awesome haircut.

 Stop trying to be friends first.  Assume attraction. Kill approach anxiety. 

2-3 years of consistent effort and you can go from a 5 to 7. It works for guys with a decent starting point.

Another important note is that a 5 will see results faster. A wardrobe and hair cut can bring a 5 to 6. His friends will compliment his newbie gains. This postive feedback will motivate him to continue his journey.

**However TRP was never meant for Bottom Tier Omegas**

Omegas are guys who have no social life , no experience with women, are downright unattractive in multiple ways, and  are considers creeps by literally everyone who interacts with them. 


Our Omega is a 2. TRP welcomes all men with open arms and will try to help them. 

In theory TRP could work for them, but there no advice for guys who are starting from zero. 

How do you teach someone how socialize and flirt through a Reddit post? It's almost impossible.  


2-3 years of consistent effort and these guys will go from a 2 to 5. All that work to get mediocre women our AFC was running from . 

And these guys will see no fast results. Girls don't care if the obese guy has swag. Your newbie gains can't compensate for your social anxiety  . They get no positive feedback until they reach the minimum of 5. 


Any new trick or theory they learn from TRP can only be tested years after they see it. The AFC can test it out when he goes out or even on his GF/wife. Maybe an Omega can try it out some girl he's orbited but that's about it. It'll be months of improving himself and learning the basics before he can test TRP.

Even on the topic orbiting the advice should differ. If the Omega has literally one girl in his life, maybe he shouldn't ""next"" her. That's the only socializing with a girl he has. He should practice what hes learnt on her. Our normal beta can find another girl hence he can ""next"" her. 

You'd have to make an entirely new sub for guys who need to get from 2-5.  Then they can graduate to TRP.

**Here I explain the rise of the Blackpill**

The balding, 5'3,  Indian ~~janitor~~ programmer has found TRP. They've always been on Reddit. Reddit was built for these guys.  

This guy will be never be Chad. But TRP will give him hope. And he will be disappointed.  

The OG RP dude bros just didn't quite understand what they were dealing with when they tried to save Redditors . ECs would  tell them to talk to girls and these guys would ask how. ""What do you mean how? Just flirt like you usually do"". Poor asktrp ECs probably never realized they were talking to Omegas. 

Eventually the manlets, autists and  indians/asians realized that even if they did everything TRP said they wouldn't get the results of someone with a better starting point. 

Hence The BlackPill was born - Genetic Determinism the ideology. Some guys simply have lower ceilings.

Some guys will never reach 7.5 and get to date stacies and plate beckies.  Some guys peak at 5. 

""All that work just to be average? lol "" These bottom tier guys all denounced TRP and made their own subs. However one thing they  took from TRP was pushing women off pedestal. They did that perfectly.

This what ultimately lead to the death of TRP.  All the AFCs came improved and left, leaving the dregs of Reddit. The ECs struggled with the omegas who believed they had potential; who eventually graduated. And the omegas who felt they'd never make it  denounced The RedPill and took The BlackPill",1

412,413,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

5565,5566,"Is it just me or is it time to normalise non-invasive vasectomies the way we do IUDs? #ittakestwoBefore anyone gets defensive, lets break this down. Non-invasive vasectomies are...NON-INVASIVE. Theyre an outpatient procedure and after reading a lot about it, theyre compared to dental procedures that you can drive home from, and the worst part is the pain of anaesthetics. The only issue seems to be that vasectomies are harder (and completely possible) to reverse, and that insurance doesnt cover reversal (but they do cover vasectomies).

Now lets discuss IUDs. In a lot of countries, people who havent given birth aret considered for IUD procedures and some countries administer local anaesthesia. Im not mentioning it because I agree, but because of the implications of severity. Most women are given ibuprofen, which doesnt do much considering you have to push past the cervix opening (that is closed tight) with a rod to insert an IUD. For those who are having a hard time imagining, think about a hard rod being shoved up your urethra. 

As for side effects, where do I even begin? Constant bleeding for 1-6 months after the insertion? Weight gain? Acne? Fever and debilitating cramps after insertion? Severe PMS mood swings that border on clinical depression? Life threatening (ectopic) pregnancy? Irregular/heavy bleeding until its taken out? Increase risked of infections? Perforation (piercing through the uterus wall)? Extreme cramping with a copper (non-hormonal) IUD?

I am sick and tired, and frankly, disgusted, by the pressures put on women to be the ones responsible for birth control when it takes two to reproduce. And for the people who think: not my body, not my problem, you think paying for an abortion or child support is a risk not worth taking? Birth control comes with awful side effects, and do you know how stressful it is to take a pill at the same time everyday? Do you know what its like to make plans always having to consider that? Compared to a one-time non-invasive, outpatient procedure that has the highest rates of preventing pregnancy?

I see high school and college students taking responsibility and getting IUD insertions. Its about time we start calling out absurd double standards and placing responsibility on all participating parties.

Dear women, dont feel discouraged. Im iffy about talking to my male friends about this but what seems to separate the boys from the men is that while boys remain self-centred and self-involved, men understand my stance and even begin to agree with it.

I want to reiterate, Im not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves. Im here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them.

#ittakestwo

[Edit: I dont know if vasectomies are a viable solution. BUT...I would like to point out the discrepancy in the way we discuss what men might have to endure and what women have repeatedly endured. If theres such a huge burden on women, isnt it worth it to discuss and explore a variety of solutions no matter how bizarre they might seem before shutting it down completely? Are womens burdens THAT insignificant that we immediately shut down something that seems scary but may or may not be scary in actuality? THAT insignificant that we shut down solutions because the IDEA of it causes discomfort? THAT insignificant that possible pain takes priority of actual pain?]",0

###Physical

Goal: don't just *maintain muscle, gain muscle* over the next 60 days. 

Measurement: post cropped before and after pics as evidence.

Day 1 http://imgur.com/a/HT3NZYY

Week 1: 207lbs ~22%BF

Week 2: 201lbs ~20%BF

Week 3: 198lbs ~19%BF

Week 4/Day 30: 195lbs https://imgur.com/a/waZTVe6

Diet goal is to hit sub 15% BF during the Time Of No Lifts

Hygiene: I had already been brushing my teeth, washing my face, feet, and ass before finding MRP. I have now cleaned my living space and am going to keep it organized and orderly, I let things pile up over the last few weeks while I've been prioritizing work and fucking around with girls 

###Mental

If I don't put me and my responsibilities first I will end up right back where I started, possibly in a worse place. It needs to be where I'm not chasing pussy, pussy is chasing me, and I give it the time of day on my terms and on my time, when my shit has actually been owned, and I have time to spare that I want to spend enjoying the company of a woman worth my time.

The external validation is like meth, extremely addictive, and it had been so long since I've felt a woman's interest, it was like being a first time user. In some ways I really am. On some level I knew all this, yet was weak over the last 2 weeks and indulged anyway. I'm coming down off of the validation binge now, and settling into what I said I needed to do last OYS: a more manageable amount of time spent on plating. I'll continue to step down my time commitment over the coming weeks, and continue working on identifying when I'm interacting for their validation (don't do it) and when I'm interacting for my own enjoyment and giving my time freely without expecting something back. 

###Family

Still not spending as much time as I was here before plating, makes sense, you can only do one thing with your time at any given moment, I can't read 48LOP as a bedtime story to my 3yo, nor can I be at home with my kids if I'm out on a date, or at work, etc. 

###Financial

Saving a lot. Stimulus came in, saving that too. 

Bought some new clothes in prep for Style week of 60DoD, this should finish out the cycling of my wardrobe that I've done over the last 6 months, it will be piecemeal from now on, cleaning out old/stained things and replacing those with new ones. 

###Professional

My temporary assignment is nearly over, and the permanent promotions needed to free up that position for me haven't happened yet. They did extend me in this position though, another month. No matter what I'm in so much of a better position to take the next similar opening that its not even funny. I killed it over the last 3 months and everyone, I mean everyone, knows it. 

###Social

Been having fun on my dates. 

Fucked Property Manager again, this time without the Nice Guy backdrop - I just did what I wanted, came, and that was that. Didn't worry about her at all. Spent a total of an hour at her place? Doesn't really matter. I wanted to fuck, so I did. 

Date 2 with Nurse is tomorrow. She said maybe at first, so I asked the next day ""is it a yes for you, or should I put that time back out on the market?"" Her ""Woooow, you are cut throat"" I said, my free time is valuable to me, we can hang out next week if it isn't good for you, just don't leave me in limbo. She said ""Got it"" and agreed to the date. We are doing a private Happy Hour at a secluded spot I picked out. 

Date 2 with Diver is a maybe, this one is a good learning opportunity for me, she's super assertive and independent, and I'm sometimes not sure how to respond because of it. She talked so much that I don't have to say much. We agreed to a plan, and when I texted to confirm the day before, she reneged but offered to reschedule to the next day. So I told her to come up with the idea, and once she had decided and suggested it I put a plan together to make it worth my time and fun for me and gave her a part in it. That plan she followed my lead and completed her assigned part quite well. Internally I focused on not reacting to her having so casually altered agreed on plans and staying positive and fun instead of getting offended like a faggot that she didn't do what I wanted when I wanted.

Date 2 with Physical Therapist is a maybe. She's smart but kind of full of herself, maybe takes herself a little too seriously. 

Date 1 with Server who shit tested is later this week. 

Out of the 4 I like Nurse and Phys the best, they are the most fun to be with, but I'm keeping the pipeline moving. Lining up 4 more girls, but not taking so much time with any of them as I did the first batch. I'm learning.

###Marriage

STBX was pissed back in February because I sent our tax refund to my personal account, then transferred her half when it came in. ""It should have gone to our joint account"" - and now with the stimulus it automatically went to my account again  so she was upset again. So I told her ""You threatened to take money that doesn't belong to you when you overreacted to me putting the savings back in savings at the end of last year. I've shared everything we've received 50/50. Maybe don't make threats next time, and I won't feel the need to protect myself."" She tried to twist the facts, but I stood my ground, so she texted my mom a screengrab of our conversation . My mom told me she had and said I should be nicer... I told her to mind her own business. 

Nothing else significant... finally found a place still doing Notary work and made an appointment this next week to get the uncontested document Notarized, STBX will be there to sign. 

###Goals

Don't let on that I know about her indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (14 week streak)

Go to at least one Social activity without family. (3 week streak)

(Case in point, my teachers might have said 'women's access to professional work has historically been limited by law and stigma to lesser-paying roles'.)  Yet, if your partner is into statistics, and thinks that only the most comprehensive and up-to-date will do:

[https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap](https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap)  
""The controlled gender pay gap, which controls for job title, years of experience, industry, location and other compensable factors, has also decreased, but only by $0.01 since 2015. Women in the controlled group make $0.98 for every $1 a man makes.

New to the gender pay gap report for 2020 is analysis on the impact of lost wages on lifetime earnings. By calculating presumptive raises given over a 40-year career, we find that women in the uncontrolled group stand to lose $900,000 on average over a lifetime. Lost earnings narrow to $80,000 for the controlled group, but this is still significant, especially if you consider how lost earnings due to the gender pay gap would grow with compound interest if invested each year for 40 years.""

Also, as a man who's come a long way from where I once was - if you don't think that the housework is being shared equally but he does, 98 times out of 100 you're right.  I was very good at confusing myself about the relative value of the work I was doing for the household, and advocating for my cockamamie logic.

3207,3208,"The way the concept of a patriarchy is abused genuinely scares me.
Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that ""Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world"" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment. 

You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world. There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues. 

The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.

The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.

I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.",0

Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men
and humanising terrorists and what not. The cultural values you keep referring
to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially
in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape
accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed  
two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is
exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing
a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know
feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said?
As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's
family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage
with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a
girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively
because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a
heroic romance then god bless you. God save you.

4557,4558,"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 05, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

3150,3151,"About the double standards of Reddit (the ""what if we reversed the genders"" case)I'm mostly targetting the AITA and relationsip\_advice subreddits, there are many time where people say ""Just reverse the genders and people would react very differently"".

I agree with these claims several time, and it's very likely that there is an ""empathy"" gap where women get support or understanding and men don't.

For example :  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5xt2c/my_girlfriend_wont_let_me_finish_in_her_mouth/) is about a guy whose GF won't give him a blowjob (or won't let him finish in her mouth, the post is unclear) and almost everybody just tell him to deal with it and stop wanting it. While at the same time  [another posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5vcda/nsfw_my_boyfriend_absolutely_will_not_go_down_on/) about a girl whose BF won't go down on her get responses telling her to dump the dude.

I've also seen two AITA posts about a parent wanting nothing to do with their born child because they didn't want it when the pregnancy happened but the pregnancy was carried anyway:

You guessed it, the woman had tons of NTA saying she's not forced to get involved in the child's life. And the man got almost unanimously YTA saying that if he has sex he should be ready to be a father.(I wanted to put the posts but unfortunately one of them have been deleted and the second post's link was in the comments of the first)

I'm pretty sure that it has been discussed a lot, with many examples, do you have other links and examples ?

3564,3565,"Thoughts about gender-related insults?A friend of mine asked me yesterday if I thought an email she'd written sounded 'bitchy,' and it got me thinking about this. The friend is a feminist, if that makes a difference. Her choice of words took me aback a little because 'bitchy' isn't used often among the people with whom I hang out. I don't use it myself, but due to a general aversion to profanity or otherwise harsh language rather than any concerns about sexism. Upon reflection, though, I thought that 'bitchy' actually bothered me a bit rather than just surprising me. 

*Is* it sexist? 'Bitchy' only ever seems to be directed at either women or people perceived to be acting in a feminine or effeminate manner. Relatedly, the insult 'dick' (which I also don't use, but again not for sexism-related reasons) is pretty much never applied to women. However, something being statistically associated with only one gender doesn't mean it's necessarily sexist. 

It's not like I'd tell my friend she should stop using the term, but I am curious about feminists' views on gender-related insults such as this. Are they sexist? Or does nobody really care? It's quite possible I only took note of it due to great boredom rather than any actual hint of sexism.",0

I don't think politics should be removed from games, because you are forcing particular narratives to be silenced.

Story-driven games need to focus on the stories itself, and not being preachy. Games can't sacrifice what makes it fun for the sake of a narrative.

flocked in theaters to watch that film only because it got word of mouth
publicity for being the scariest movie of it's [time.It](http://time.it/) was
banned in several places but people still took buses to watch the movie in the
next town.The show 'Game Of Thrones', 'Breaking Bad' and 'Dexter' had a lot of
impact on people.They have fan clubs for superhero movies.A lot of people were
committing murders after watching 'Dexter' series.'Gone Girl' inspired a lot
of people to commit similar crimes.'Titanic' had that same effect on people
who were gushing over 'Jack & Rose' romance.K-Pop and K-drama has forced a lot

Bollywood.Most Indians are middle class or lower middle class people who are

>TL;DR A girl I've known for a while, with some common friends. How to contact her and chat a bit, making your intentions of going out after the lockdown clear but without sounding like a sex predator or something?

I think this is something others are experiencing in this period too

So, there is this girl I kinda like, but we have a basic ""hello, how you doin'"" relationship since a while and haven't seen each other in months

Now, I'm thinking hell why not contact her, write a bit and polarize the thing, so when the lockdown is over we can go grab a coffee and you know.

I can see 2 problems:

\* I don't want to come off as creepy, contacting her now after months and we never talked much anyway. I really want a genuine connection

BUT

\* I don't want to come off as an uninterested friend neither. I mean, while I genuinely enjoy human contact and knowing people, regardless of everything, it should be clear that I am also looking for a more intimate thing, polarize it, that is.

I would just invite her for a coffee... if things were normal. But now?

Basic question you may ask me: why now after months?

Well, I'm a bit insecure and now I'm working on that part of myself, and also yes, I'm bored. And she is cute, and smart.

Sure I agree with you. But most of the times people aren't equally good-looking in which case the better-looking guy is always going to win because personality won't compensate for looks.

How? 80% of rejections happen in the first 5 seconds of an interaction. You can immediately see the way a girl responds to you in the first few seconds if she's gonna let you flirt with her or not. If she doesn't like the way you look she's just gonna give you one-word replies, put on a bitch-face and have negative body language. Good luck flirting with that.

men and a woman in this country cannot even raise voice against someone to
protect her modesty. all kinds of social barriers are applied on her. the
documentary seems to be completely biased for sure. if compared the ratio of
crime done against men and women , women stands in majority. i am surprised
that how callously this fact has been ignored. pity and shame !! the only
solution i feel to this is that :  
  
a : india should stop calling itself a liberal country. it's not !  
  
b : separate school, colleges, hospitals, transportation for men and women. so
there's least interaction.  
  
c : make different compartments for men and women in any public place, office
building and different hrs for the two.  
  
it's better to divide than unite.",0

4319,4320,"TRP was meant for Average Frustrated Chumps not Bottom Tier Omegas**Who is the Average Frustrated Chump?**

The average frustrated chump aka our beloved beta has had a semi normal childhood. They know how to talk to people and make friends. They have a friend group that goes outs and meets girls. The average frustrated chumps has gotten girlfriends in the past and knows how to flirt(albeit badly). 

Our AFC is a 5.

The purpose of TRP was to teach 5's how to improve their looks to a 7.5 and how to act like a player.       
 It also teaches men to take women off the pedestal. 

Go to the gym, fix your wardrobe , get an awesome haircut.

 Stop trying to be friends first.  Assume attraction. Kill approach anxiety. 

2-3 years of consistent effort and you can go from a 5 to 7. It works for guys with a decent starting point.

Another important note is that a 5 will see results faster. A wardrobe and hair cut can bring a 5 to 6. His friends will compliment his newbie gains. This postive feedback will motivate him to continue his journey.

**However TRP was never meant for Bottom Tier Omegas**

Omegas are guys who have no social life , no experience with women, are downright unattractive in multiple ways, and  are considers creeps by literally everyone who interacts with them. 


Our Omega is a 2. TRP welcomes all men with open arms and will try to help them. 

In theory TRP could work for them, but there no advice for guys who are starting from zero. 

How do you teach someone how socialize and flirt through a Reddit post? It's almost impossible.  


2-3 years of consistent effort and these guys will go from a 2 to 5. All that work to get mediocre women our AFC was running from . 

And these guys will see no fast results. Girls don't care if the obese guy has swag. Your newbie gains can't compensate for your social anxiety  . They get no positive feedback until they reach the minimum of 5. 


Any new trick or theory they learn from TRP can only be tested years after they see it. The AFC can test it out when he goes out or even on his GF/wife. Maybe an Omega can try it out some girl he's orbited but that's about it. It'll be months of improving himself and learning the basics before he can test TRP.

Even on the topic orbiting the advice should differ. If the Omega has literally one girl in his life, maybe he shouldn't ""next"" her. That's the only socializing with a girl he has. He should practice what hes learnt on her. Our normal beta can find another girl hence he can ""next"" her. 

You'd have to make an entirely new sub for guys who need to get from 2-5.  Then they can graduate to TRP.

**Here I explain the rise of the Blackpill**

The balding, 5'3,  Indian ~~janitor~~ programmer has found TRP. They've always been on Reddit. Reddit was built for these guys.  

This guy will be never be Chad. But TRP will give him hope. And he will be disappointed.  

The OG RP dude bros just didn't quite understand what they were dealing with when they tried to save Redditors . ECs would  tell them to talk to girls and these guys would ask how. ""What do you mean how? Just flirt like you usually do"". Poor asktrp ECs probably never realized they were talking to Omegas. 

Eventually the manlets, autists and  indians/asians realized that even if they did everything TRP said they wouldn't get the results of someone with a better starting point. 

Hence The BlackPill was born - Genetic Determinism the ideology. Some guys simply have lower ceilings.

Some guys will never reach 7.5 and get to date stacies and plate beckies.  Some guys peak at 5. 

""All that work just to be average? lol "" These bottom tier guys all denounced TRP and made their own subs. However one thing they  took from TRP was pushing women off pedestal. They did that perfectly.

This what ultimately lead to the death of TRP.  All the AFCs came improved and left, leaving the dregs of Reddit. The ECs struggled with the omegas who believed they had potential; who eventually graduated. And the omegas who felt they'd never make it  denounced The RedPill and took The BlackPill",1

2094,2095,"Withdrawing A Guilty Plea Before Sentencing?Please excuse if this question has been answered before. I am new to reddit and don't have much time to help my friend who I believe has been pressured into pleading guilty to a crime he does not believe himself guilty of. I will refer to him as David here, however this of course is not his real name and I will not provide any identifying details even if asked.

David is considering trying to withdraw his guilty plea, for the following reasons:

What happened:

1. Five minutes before his plea was due, whilst at the court, he was told the prosecution had completely rewritten the description of the charges against him, to which he claims to be innocent of and has much proof of.
2. He was told by his solicitor he 'will' be found guilty of the new charge by a jury because they will all hate him and ignore his evidence.
3. He was told he will not get 1/3 off his sentence if he does not admit his guilt right there and then. He was told it would be expensive to defend himself and that pleading guilty will save everyone a lot of money.
4. He argued with his solicitor that it did not feel right but minutes later they were called to the court room.
5. As he walked to the courtroom with his solicitor he was told again he should say guilty when asked.
6. Just before he was asked to plea the judge offered an adjournment of a few days to allow defence to consider the rewritten charge, however his solicitor declined the offer without consulting my friend at all.
7. During the plea itself the defence solicitor mouthed plead guilty multiple times at my friend as he hesitated.
8. The rewritten charge arbitrarily changed the period of the offence from a couple of months, to a whole year and included additional un-provable claims not stated before.
9. Later he was told that he could put in a basis of plea setting out his version of events and disputing certain accusations that form the charge. The basis of plea was then submitted but the CPS is saying they will not accept it because it was not agreed at the time of the plea hearing.

In addition to the above, David is suffering from chronic depression, officially homeless, often suicidal and very, very vulnerable at this time. As a result, he is very easily influenced and due to the nature of the charges, finds if very hard to argue his innocence without people saying he sounds more guilty by doing so, or he is minimising the offence.

IANAL but from my understanding of both the evidence and his explanations. I do not believe him guilty of this crime, although I admit I may be biased and it is a complicated case. He is in a really terrible place at the moment and I want to help him as best I can before what I believe is a miscarriage of justice occurs.

Please could someone advise how he might go about asking to withdraw his plea, if this is even possible given the circumstances. His own solicitor has threatened to resign from the case if my friend tries to change his plea now, leaving him undefended with very little time to act before his sentencing.",0

**Physical**

Apparently my gym (24 Hour Fitness) will be declaring bankruptcy.

**Reading** Models, TRM:PM

Began working on the demographics exercise from Models - what am I? Who is in my sphere, my ""demographic"" and thus who might be attracted to me? Business women who travel 100%? That would be the woman who picked me up last year. Its still academic as NYC is talking about a July or August opening. As I worked on it a question occurred to me: Is wife in the demographic that would be attracted to me? Spoiler: no.

**Mindset**

Maybe it was due to being stuck with no female interaction other then wife, but I need to own the fail day I had last week that was off/on for almost the entire day: While reading thru a disassembly of some hapless n00b in the comments in askMRP I realized I've still got a lot of work still to do myself. PON helped me realize how tied up my ego is in ""being the victim"". And I've been working on the exercises for that. But I'm like Alex j Anderson's passive aggressive evil twin. I'm the unicorn that should not have been cheated on. I'm the only one ever to deal with an alpha widow, etc, etc. Each time I started down this mental spiral I was able to stop - for a time, but then it would sneak back in. The siren call of the self-pitying mope. On the positive side, I have the tools to deal with this, I kept all this to myself (at least I think I did), and I appear to have a ""floor"" that I can climb back up from. 

**Relationship**

It was pointed out to me in last week's comments that she's probably faking it: She's most likely still not attracted to me - she's doing it out of obligation, or to keep me from being Billy Beta Butthurt, etc. Was I trying to ""prove"" something? Be better than him? Am I keeping ""score""? I was for a while, but now I focus on what I feel like. I keep the pedal down on polarity and let it play out however it will.

Overall I find myself laughing at the pathetic loser I used to be, and probably still am. The day after that fail day I actually laughed out loud thinking back to it. What a waste of time that was.  I think that may be my mission: to just enjoy myself. Stop taking myself, or what she thinks, with any seriousness whatsoever. Instead just laugh. Too much other shit going on to get hung up on this ""relationship"" crap.",0

**The Break:**

I took a break from the sub for a while. It was recommended by more experienced guys. I couldn't see it at the time but I was clinging to MRP like a life buoy.

**Mindset:**

I am confident that the work that I am doing is compounding. I can see how I celebrate too early. Instead I will use those times to recalibrate. There is some learned helplessness masked by distractions that I need to deal with.

# MAP

**Physical:**

The home workouts are going well. I will work faster at the gym when it reopens. I will use current frustration to fuel more workouts.

**Money and Material Wealth:**

The work I was doing before the pandemic is steady. It is more demanding. I will systemise more and dedicate the time to new opportunities. That is what I am going to focus on for the rest of the month of May.

My best cash ooportunity is via my creativity. I will set up sales channels for this with the time gained from routinisation.

I am a maker. I can make and manage production teams. The review and reorientation process is my least favorite. This because it doesnt feel like making. This effects my earnings and options. I need to incorporate improvement in these phases into my money and management systems.

**Comfort:**

The comfort I gave myself recently is a few drinks at the weekend. What I am masking is dissatisfaction. I have cut out the weekend drinking to force myself to define what I want more specifically.

There is resentment in the lack of looking after myself first. Previously I have either over battled or bailed. Again the need for calibration raises it head.

HOA made a comment to the effect You cant create for someone what you havent created for yourself. Well...you can. But it is not good. Weve a saying where Im from, The cobblers children go barefoot. Enough of this.

To be congruent you have to build your frame for yourself, not on the promise of favorable outcomes. 


**DHV:**

I was advising on National projects for my countrys response to Covid-19 this coupled with my busy work life, home workout and OYSing has taken on an extra positive halo during the 'crisis'. As the kids say, Im glowed up. But its because of the theatre lights.

This adds to dread. Her compliance is increasing and harpiness is decreasing. The current situation is demonstrating to my family and network that I prepared for this type of work reshuffle for years.

This is resulting in more efforts to keep me and some shitty comfort tests. I have reread some of J10's posts on Shitty Comfort Tests and managed them accordingly. 

I have some residual resentment about AWALT. I will channel this in lifting. And into reflecting on my personality and preferences.

In addition I have been coasting in the sunlight that comes from not being an autist during a pandemic. 

It's time to up my game and take advantage of the free roll Covid has given many of us.


**Personality and Preference:**

This is emerging more. I am making the space to express my preferences by better planning and taking the time to reflect. 

**Sex:**

The sex is always there. I get it when I want it. It's enthusiastic. I'm not here for that anymore. 

There are things I would like to try in bed but it's not a priority. More precisely, its note a priority with my wife in her current body shape. Her tits look great and BJ performance has improved through more nuance and demonstrable hunger. 

The only game i am running is asshole game combined with push/pull and healthy doses of stfu. It works fine at the moment. I could add kino. 

Oneitis is dead but willingness to Nuke the Nuclear Family isnt in play yet. I could do it but would I? 

Early in this process I would have said yes, but anger would have been the fuel. I may say 'yes' again soon and improved preparedness will be the gate to that transition.",0

Don't ask her a question. It puts some pressure on her to reply and if she doesn't, you're gonna feel...not nice. 

Just send her a flirty non-needy statement that makes her know that you were thinking of her. Back and forth for a bit, then suggest going out after the lockdown lifts.

I don't actively seek social justice themed media but i feel like having good social justice themed role models would help the upcoming generations. I know for a lot of white men social justice is a confusing mess of rules and regulations for them and it kinda just turns them off of any kind of allyship. 

The elder scrolls may borrow historically accurate settings (each race being a historical race/empire) but they do such a good job of blending those historical connections into an original lore that you lose any grounds for historical accuracy. As for women in the game, the series touches on slavery, criminal rights, racism, war crimes, nationalism, classism etc. but it rarely talks about women's liberation. Women in the game just kind of exist as characters they're not the lesser and they're not some cheesy ""me women, hear me roar"" trope.",0

3422,3423,"Why are the caring loving fathers against their daughters being a housewife and dating an older man?If I follow the redpill ideology it says that the best thing I should do at 21, should be to stop going to uni, get married to a man 10-15 years older than me and be a SAHM. But my father was actually the one who wanted me to be an indpendant career woman, to have my own money, to study hard, and he say himself that he will never accept a guy whos more than 8 years older than me as a son-in-law. 

Hes not the only one, cause most of my friends that had a great relationship with their fathers seems to get the same advices which is studying, enjoying their youth, having their own money and then getting married to someone they love and theyre attracted to.

My uncle literally hated his daughters boyfriend because he was overweight and short, which means that men are not against women dating chads when it comes to their beloved daughters 

Especially that its funny how most men hate being judged for their career, but theyre the first to look down on their daughters boyfriend if hes jobeless.


The only fathers that are okay with their daughters having low standards usually turn out to be abusives parents and partners that dont give a shit about their offsprings, but most fathers who love their daughters seems to wants them to follow a path that contradict what the redpill wants for women",0

Googling all the names separately and adding ""lesbian activist"" gave me Julie Bindel, Janice Raymond and (I think) Marc Stein. I'm not familiar with any of these (though at least the first two don't seem to like trans people too much so keep that in mind), but I think I see what's going on here.

So I'm now going to invent, I mean discover a very serious disease called the Shapiro-Kirk-Spencer Syndrome. It's a serious mental and physical disorder where after hearing too many angry white men yelling on youtube about Anita Sarkeesian, your brain will begin to leak out of your ears. It also attacks the brains capability of logical thought and reasoning. It's very sad. I mean, sufferers might even start thinking it's possible to sell flooded and underwater houses. It's devastating. And definitely not three alt-right guys I thought of from the top of my head.",0
