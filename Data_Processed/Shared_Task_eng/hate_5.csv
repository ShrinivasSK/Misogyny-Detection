410,411,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

This happened in news with a weeks time and a boy already suicide, some of them are <15yr olds.

> Meanwhile, a new angle to the controversy has also come out on social media. One of the women who had initially outed the group has had her old conversations leaked which show her sexualising men and using homophobic and misogynistic language. 

> Social media users have been using the term Girls Locker Room to discuss how deeply embedded the problem is.

A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners.  Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 

2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play 

One of those factors, sadly, are looks. 
And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or  if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good.

You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about.

___

Women actively look for men who make more money.  Married men make more money not because the wife is cooking and cleaning which somehow helps them earn more, but because their wives saw that they were on promising career trajectories before marrying them:

######Ludwig, V., & Brderl, J. (2018). Is there a male marital wage premium? New evidence from the United States. *American Sociological Review*, 83(4), 744-770. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122418784909?journalCode=asra&

___

A lack of high earning men will cause women to focus on their careers instead of finding a husband.  I believe this study was discussed here in the past:

___

A man's wealth is directly correlated with how women rate him.  A similar effect the other way around is small to non existent.  Men select for looks and personality.  Women select, quite literally, for looks and money:

A loss of income is the single largest predictive factor for a wife wanting to divorce her husband.  The same is not true the other way around.  And interestingly, a wife's inability or refusal to ""cook and clean"" does not effect a husband's willingness to divorce her, either.  I'm not sure if this study goes into this, but my guess is personality issues, things like nagging and harassment, might be the biggest factor for husbands:

Multiple studies show that most women aspire to have easy careers, work part time, or otherwise be a stay at home mom supported by a husband.  I've seen estimates from ~65% and up.  This one is 84%:

######https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/

There is a study showing that most men (around 65%) would prefer to be stay at home dads / husbands, so there isn't much of a gender difference here.  Most people regardless of gender prefer to stay home over working a job.  Many would even call it a *privilege*.

Women just have significantly more power and control in the dating and marriage market, so they tend to get their way more often.  In fact there's a plethora of research showing that wives and girlfriends command significantly more power in relationships than men do.

I had horrible experience in dating with women before. All went sour because I was too needy.   
Thanks everyone on this sub.  


The push and pull technique really worked! And for me, it's the best method to get women.  
Women are more driven by emotion than logic. They get ""aroused"" when they get  curious about you.  
I gave her different signals. I am not predictable. I made sure she is always confused.  


I stopped obsessing about her. Before, I was checking her online status and social medias 24/7.  
I went out to play soccer/football, get a job, kept myself busy and play video games to stop being needy all the time. I realized I was talking and chatting her through the phone all day.

When I read about this sub, I immidietly stopped that hobby. 

She got attached to me because we were constantly chatting, so I decided to ""push"" her away by not replying her messages instantly. Declined her coffee and pizza invitations. Declined to play video games with her. I didn't make myself available all the time. Now she is thinking about me. 

Then I make my self available and chat to her always, then again go cold for a while - repeat. Making her really confused. ""Does he like me or not?""


This created more attraction.   
But it's really hard to control yourself. I just made myself busy to stop being needy.
 
Never confess your feelings to your crush. Why? Because she gets bored, she is no longer curious because she already got the answer.
When women fall in love to you, they become ""obssesed"". They no longer give a shit to your wealth and physical appearance.",1

Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.

Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct.

Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

Her own words = Women have one mission in life: to be beautiful. When one gets old, one must learn how to break mirrors. I am very gently expecting to die

I saw her in name in a post about historical mistresses and looked her up. She started out in a poor family and worked as a maid. She ran away with a boyfriend, found a sponsor, revamped her image, and completely changed her life all because men wanted her. She had all kinds of lovers including powerful men and got to live in luxury. Women didnt have the same opportunities back then to grow businesses or get an education but beauty was the female equivalent to having power.

Nowadays, women have more opportunities to be independent and get a career but I feel like thats made people oblivious to the idea that appearances still matter a lot for women. I actually feel like the stakes are higher nowadays. Now, you have to be educated AND still attractive. Also, beauty standards have become stricter. With plastic surgery, makeup, growth of modeling/fashion industry, social media, etc. its kinda sad and funny that this woman would probably only be considered a normie/Becky-lite nowadays.",1

I was just thinking right now about how charli dimelio is completely average facially in the sense that she isnt strikingly beautiful. Her face is just non offensive so that makes her good looking in an upper tier normie way. 

Then I began thinking okay maybe it about her body since she makes dance videos primarily. And again her body is fairly standard for a 15 year old. Shes just thin in that desirable but still achievable way. 

Everything about her is marginally upper tier normieaside from her technical dance skills which are significantly above averageand yet shes RULING a looks based social medium. 

This really got me thinking about how once you are just conservatively above average as a white woman most of the worlds doors are open to you. Everything about Charlis look is inoffensive. I always expected her to be some really genetically blessed girl because of all the hype surrounding her. But her moderately above averageness is what has made her palatable to a large audience.

Charlis a big reminder to me that lookism really doesnt affect white women. The complaint is always about not having the benefits of the best looking white women. But there are benefits exclusive to being an average looking white woman that, in some cases, I would take over being Stacey.

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

Woman dont care that much about being approached. They often get approached badly and by creeps, but youre not one of them.

The ones you want are the ones that are emotionally stable, like men and like sex. Its not that big a deal to say hi.

3286,3287,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

4064,4065,"I Have Been Doing Cold Approach For 2 Years Now: This Is How I Went From Kissless Handholdless Virgin To 15 Lays In 1 Month&#x200B;

About 3 years ago, I was a 29 year old Asian guy with only a couple months to go before I turned 30, working at a Big 3 Accounting Firm, and I was realizing that I was unhappy and miserable, working long hours at all times of the day and night and spending all my free time playing Overwatch, and Dota 2

And despite earning good money, I had a house and some savings, I just knew my life was NOWHERE near where I wanted it to be or thought it SHOULD be, despite all the years of hard work because I was FOREVER ALONE. I was still a virgin at age 29. A kissless handholdless virgin I just wanted to take the time to finally get this off my chest since I have nothing better to do during the quarantine.

I soon decided, with the help of an epiphany while reading an article on RedPill titled HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD that this was not the life for me and that I would need to start approaching girls and learning game to have any hope of losing my virginity before 30

I didn't want to become a 100+ lay gigachad like the article outlined:

* I just wanted to experience what other guys experienced in college that I missed out on.
* I just wanted to have someone I could share my hopes and struggles with, someone I could come home to and hug if I had a bad day.
* I just wanted to have some fun before I get married and start a family

Was that really too much to ask?

So I quickly began to learn about game and seduction and browsed Reddit and other forums almost daily to get hyped up and learn how to do cold approach. I soon discovered, however, that I had bitten off far more than I could chew

I met up with a white guy I met online who seemed equally as motivated as me to go out and approach and we went out to several bars and clubs together. Every time we went out, he would always go home with a new girl, mostly Asian girls Im not proud of it, but I was extremely jealous since none of these girls gave me any kind of IOIs or other signs of attraction when I approached, and stopped going out with him. Now, I realize it's because he went to the gym a lot and always had a nice haircut, but back then, It was kind of ridiculous how Id approach girl after girl and get one word answers and a GO AWAY vibe the entire conversation and he would come in a few minutes later and THE SAME GIRL would be smiling and asking him questions about himself, it felt like he didnt even need to do any work to get laid

At this point, I was watching pickup videos from or reading articles on how to get girls on an almost daily basis, trying to study and learn all the latest game techniques. It felt like I hit a brick wall. This was SOOO much harder than I thought it would be. The HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article specifically said that women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one but that didnt seem to be the case. I was a 55 Asian guy competing with 60+ white guys at every club I went to and it felt like no matter what I said, no girls were even willing to have an actual conversation with me. This is after 100+ approaches so I knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort.

So reluctantly, after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality, I invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since I figured I was already watching so many of their videos, and its only fair that I pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing.

For those of you thinking about going to a PUA Bootcamp, be very careful you don't waste all your money like I did. This particular company did not give a single FUCK about me other than my money. My instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach, which I already knew how to do, and every time I asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive, he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off. I asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers, always giving some woo woo answer about how I needed to have outcome independence and have more fun. It was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance, even though they teach that looks don't matter.

I finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches. It was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and I just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts. At this point, I was so desperate that I tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date Over the next couple of years, I became obsessed with getting good with girls, which certainly kept me going, but it also caused some problems

I went out with so many wingmen, hoping to find that gold nugget, that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall, but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5'10"", no exceptions. I read an article on Reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot. Girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when I asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together. That's when it hit me that I didn't know as much as I thought I did and that there was a lot more to learn.

The bad news is, all this rejection was not good for my mental health. I started to wonder if maybe a short Asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate I was seriously considering moving to Thailand or The Philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife

But finally, I found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and I immersed myself in his training He was 57 and Asian, so a short Asian like me.

The first thing he told me was that my hairstyle, fashion, and body language were all shit and unless I fix them first, nothing else would work. Now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice I read like the HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article which convinced me that looks dont matter but I decided to give it a shot. I got a blazer and chinos from Zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch. I didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable IMMEDIATELY. Suddenly, they would hang in and listen to every word I had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave. One girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when I asked her to grab a drink with me! I was SOOO HAPPY, it felt like everything changed.

Next, he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt. This was really hard for me because I spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer, always hunched over. I even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after I started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients. Again, I noticed immediate results. I actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob! No lay thought because of last minute resistance

The one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety. I had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all. He had me watch episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white. This did not come easy but I worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable. This turned out to be the tipping point and I finally started getting laid regularly when I go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before. Overall, I'm very happy to have fucked 15 girls. I know that's not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it's a big improvement over ZERO.

Thats kind of the level Im at right now. The girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but Ive gotten a 7 before, mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing. The quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily, I already had a plate I was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan, so Im not wanting for sex, just spending my days reading and learning as much as I can about working out and nutrition since I got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up. Hope everyone reading this is safe and got some value from my post. Just needed to get this off my chest before work starts up again.",1

Women actively look for men who make more money.  Married men make more money not because the wife is cooking and cleaning which somehow helps them earn more, but because their wives saw that they were on promising career trajectories before marrying them:

A loss of income is the single largest predictive factor for a wife wanting to divorce her husband.  The same is not true the other way around.  And interestingly, a wife's inability or refusal to ""cook and clean"" does not effect a husband's willingness to divorce her, either.  I'm not sure if this study goes into this, but my guess is personality issues, things like nagging and harassment, might be the biggest factor for husbands:

Women just have significantly more power and control in the dating and marriage market, so they tend to get their way more often.  In fact there's a plethora of research showing that wives and girlfriends command significantly more power in relationships than men do.

If he isn't serving a woman or piling up resources a woman can land on when she's bucked off the cc, he's being childish.  Peter Pan.  It's especially objectionable to them if he's doing it with other guys, thereby preventing them from doing something that serves women.

When a man is doing something he detests that serves the interests of a woman (and her children), that's when he's being least childish in their eyes.  That's when he's a good man.  That's when he's a 'real man'.  Self-sacrifice in order to give her what she wants but doesn't need and shouldn't accept.

3282,3283,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

5398,5399,"High n count and long term relationships. Red Pill truths confirmed by a plate.TL;DR: A plate of mine confirmed red pill truths about how her having a very high N count resulted in not a single meaningful long term relationship that she so wanted to have.

We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story.

This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). 

Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). 

At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint. This seemed to calm her down a bit and I let her spin the hamster to a conclusion that all is good. After which we got down to business. 

Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here).",1

Gentlemen.... understand this.  A woman who is cheating will lie and deny better than any man who gets accused of lying.  The tears come on.  The ""how can you not trust me"" lines come out.  They will act offended, upset, hurt, etc., that you could accuse them of something so horrible.  And the kicker... they say this with HIS cum still on her breath.  I lived this shit.  It's amazing how far women will carry the betrayal.  Lies.  Trickle truths.  Gaslighting.  Manipulation.

>Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation...

I had to do that once.  When she was in the ""nothing happened"" stage, she showed me edited screenshots, where she deleted PARTS of the conversation.  The conversation made it look like it was all him.  Years later, I found the REAL screenshots in her email. She saved the full conversation for herself before editing the conversation for me to see.  Cheaters will deny everything until faced with facts IN WRITING or IN VIDEO or IN PICTURES.  

>I am quite happy with this breakup, because man, i have been wanting out, i just needed a legitimate reason for leaving now i finally caught the bitch.

""Why are you playing games with women""

This is a game that women play with men all the time.  When a man does it back to her, it disarms her.

I wrote a post called  [**How To Be Charismatic With Confidence Coming Out Of Your Pores**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/how-to-be-charismatic-with-confidence-coming-out-of-your-pores/) and it's with the elements I mention in that post and what I'm about to share with you is gonna give you an unfair advantage over your male competition when it comes to women.

So how do you tease a woman?  First and foremost, stop being thirsty to fuck.  Second, this is not teasing that goes nowhere.  The more you tease her, the more intrigued she becomes and the more she will keep you out of the friend zone.

Don't give a woman everything she wants.  When you give her everything she wants, she will start to get bored.  Keep your conversations short.  When the both of you hang out, she will enjoy your time so much more.  So if you only hang out with her for just 10-15 minutes at a time, the more she starts having feelings for you, the longer she's gonna want to spend time with you.

Her: ""What?  You have to leave?  You just got here!"" in a whiny voice.

You: ""Yeah.  I gotta go.  I have to leave for work tomorrow""

Her: ""Wanna spend the night?  I can wash what you're  wearing so you can have something clean for work tomorrow""

This is an example, don't expect this to happen exactly like this.  But you get the idea.  When a woman starts making accommodations for you to spend more time with her, she is doing what men want women to do when they ask her on a date.

Remember that women make time and switch things around for men they're attracted to.  The more desire you build up in her, the less resistance she'll have.  If she's suppose to hang out with her girls, she'll do it earlier or later to make time for you.

If you learn how to focus on building the desire in her, you won't have to worry about sleeping with her... she'll do her best to make sure that it's gonna happen.",1

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time.

I was just thinking right now about how charli dimelio is completely average facially in the sense that she isnt strikingly beautiful. Her face is just non offensive so that makes her good looking in an upper tier normie way. 

Then I began thinking okay maybe it about her body since she makes dance videos primarily. And again her body is fairly standard for a 15 year old. Shes just thin in that desirable but still achievable way. 

Everything about her is marginally upper tier normieaside from her technical dance skills which are significantly above averageand yet shes RULING a looks based social medium. 

This really got me thinking about how once you are just conservatively above average as a white woman most of the worlds doors are open to you. Everything about Charlis look is inoffensive. I always expected her to be some really genetically blessed girl because of all the hype surrounding her. But her moderately above averageness is what has made her palatable to a large audience.

Charlis a big reminder to me that lookism really doesnt affect white women. The complaint is always about not having the benefits of the best looking white women. But there are benefits exclusive to being an average looking white woman that, in some cases, I would take over being Stacey. 

As a black women you can never been palatable to such a large ground of people no matter your looks level. Thats disheartening.",1
3348,3349,"There's a lot of layers to it to hate. I think what irritates me the most is the inferred superiority in it. There are circumstances where I can imagine the word 'slut' being used either between consenting adults into dirty talk, or even as a self-identifier used with pride. I can't imagine 'thot' being used in any such way, because its always about that girl over there whose a whore. I find something deeply offensive in the idea that you're better than a woman, because she's had sex, or more likely, feels any sort of ownership in her own sexuality.

This tries directly into it being related to this fragile, bullshit macho attitude. There's a distinct component to toxic masculinity that is the idea that a man is inherently superior to a woman, and should have the pick of the litter for some idiot ideal of pure virgin waifu who's never so much as conceived of a dick and is outright terrified of masculine power.  Thot is an extension of this, a declaration of being above a woman who simply isn't some submissive, terrified maiden.

5543,5544,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.

Others may post pictures for the sole purpose of getting people to ""like"" it and compliment them. No one with high self esteem would need that much attention from people.

We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story.

This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). 

Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). 

At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint. This seemed to calm her down a bit and I let her spin the hamster to a conclusion that all is good. After which we got down to business. 

Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here).",1

Still reading some of the sidebar, The Book of Pook, The seduction method. WISNIFG.

**Physical/training**

Finally got the form issue sorted with BP, hope to see more chest growth coming weeks. Compiled pictures of muscle development and see continuous progress since mid feb when I started. 

Got private boxing training from a friend which was great. Hoping to do this every week.

**Marriage/How not to do MRP**

Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good.

After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down  (crying and  asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed.

Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my  worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good.

Failings:

\- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit

\- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol)

\-  Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that)

\- No real OI when facing denial/indifference.

Success (I think)

\- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats.

\- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly)

\- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval)

\- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account"").

**Mental**

Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes.

**Sex**

After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz.   

**Family**

Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great.

**Social**

Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends.

**Week goals**

\- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success)

\- No losing calm at all (2 week success)

\- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend)

**Shit owning / Goals**

\- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue)

\- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week)

\- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot.

~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here.

~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though.

\- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame.

~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.)

\- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there)

**Mission**

\- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle.

If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.

^3  Mild condescension is ok.  Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.  Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid.  Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.",1

Male games who go outside love to talk about their favourite games, dont focus on what they hate and love to encourage people, no matter what gender, to play their fave games.

On the flip side, I've come across far more women virtue signalling ugly men online than I have in reality. A self pitying male irl doesn't really get more than an ""awww, I'm sure you'll find someone."" A self pitying male on Reddit will get ""awww no hun I find 3ft 700lbs guys super sexy.

After hearing a million of these stories, I'm convinced that college-age women actually believe they've been raped, in situations where it's clearly not the case.  Brett Solokow, a lawyer representing women in college rape tribunals, has made similar observations.  It's basically delusional hysteria.

Women in general have no clue about their state of sexual arousal.

This is almost certainly biological, and possibly related to the fact that humans are the only primates that do not go into heat.

This tries directly into it being related to this fragile, bullshit macho attitude.

For people like myself who need to have an ethical explanation for what they do, here's why it is fair/not a double standard.

Men and women live different lives and are born with unique gifts and potentials, some overlapping, some not. Despite knowing this and capitalizing on their feminine power, many women (and their clueless simp supporters) will still try to shame men for being very choosy with their wives/common law partners/ mother of their children. 

A man building himself to his ideal man, creating an expanding frame and acquiring intellectual and physical resources will arouse and attract women as he gains momentum. Women may be ""attracted"" to the outward results of his success, but we all know they are ""aroused"" by his upward energy, his alphaness, his mission. Any woman who seduces him on that journey upward is temporarily stopping him. She has grabbed his attention temporarily, and when he busts a nut, he is satisfied where he is. Weak men stay here but an alpha man hops back on the horse and keeps moving upward. He has only been temporarily stopped.

When this man has spent many many years building himself, he may decide he is ready for a kid. This means he is very satisfied with where he is such that he is willing to now sacrifice mental physical and emotional energy into the next generation. He is literally sacrificing himself, his upward progress and his current wealth for this woman and child. This woman is getting a lot from this man- loyalty, tons of investment, and he is giving up a lot of other women who would love to be part of his now really established frame.

All he is asking back from this woman, is that she be worth giving all that up for. What makes her worth giving that up for? Certainty, or as close to it as he can come, that she will stay loyal to his frame. If she has a history of promiscuity, this means she is very willing to jump from frame to frame, giving herself to men in quick succession. Why would I commit to a woman for 18+ years if she can't stick to one frame? For a promiscuous man, the reverse isn't true. The difference is that for men to have sex, they dont need to enter a womans frame. They havent submitted to her and her reality, but the reverse happens for women. He was always simply building and expanding his frame, allowing women to enter temporarily. She on the other hand has been jumping from frame to frame.

So you see, as a man ascends and sleeps with many women along the way, enjoying them and potentially looking out for a LTR material (if hes at the phase), he is not doing damage to his ability to be loyal and invest heavily in a woman and child. This is because he has never submitted to any one woman's frame, he only built his own. The same cannot be said for a promiscuous woman.",1

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore.

1798,1799,"Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not
follow western culture(even banned in Christianity).  
Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can
only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big
misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's
genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be
genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a
gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of
nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind
later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries
earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who
fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had
multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started
getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor
he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven
that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout
your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us
a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments.
So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it
in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their
opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a
mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy
psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just
to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the
rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue
our sexual and spiritual life.  
At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the
Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be
legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature
given laws and the Truth of life.

movies with anurag, then taapsee wouldn't have got her got father and wouldn't
be that big month to attract kangana. kangana rejection has benefit to taapsee
so, she should be thankful to her rather attracting by saying she needs double

she felt kind of secured when anurag gave her a job back to back, and she felt
why not i took that opportunity to attract kangana so, that movie mafia gang
will be delighted and get job form them , which every actress wishes for. just
being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in
karan's good book list. by attracting kangana is the fastest way to get a job
from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure
hearted. so, taapsee use that tool intentionally. that is her strategy or plan
to get role from them.  
  
  
  
honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments
deals, but they never put outsider heroine on the top cuz that position only
belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia

If youre like 95% of dudes, you either dont know or dont give a fuck about style. You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go.

You wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else.

For a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else.

And if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you.

You wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them.

You never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you.

Thats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style.

A High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him.

Why?

Because his style is a visual representation of who he is.

**It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.***

Your style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier  easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet.

Its a value add on on every level.

People will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it.

# Developing Your Style

&#x200B;

*Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.*

** Epictetus**

&#x200B;

Developing your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition  it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort.

The same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life.

And yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.*

Thats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think  fuck that dude looks good.

I cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style.

But there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process;

 

# Fit is King

It doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is  be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear  fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.***

You see it all the time  fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance.

None of this shit works.

So learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration  thats half the work done.

 

# Stick to the Classics

&#x200B;

*""I live for myself and I answer to nobody.""*

*** Steve McQueen***

You dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented  all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.*

[Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years.

If you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it  he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits.

Theres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish  all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen.

 

# Keep it Simple

*Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.*

Classic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics:

&#x200B;

***Colour.***

Your colour friends are  [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589)  black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown.

Thats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match.

&#x200B;

***Less is more***

&#x200B;

*All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret  the simpler the better.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

The 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of.

*You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.*

So learn to choose carefully  or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch.

# Steal from Your Icons

*One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

If you look at any famous creative people  musicians, artists, designers, film makers  none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.

Developing your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them. Then tweak it & develop it until it becomes your own. Its that simple.

# Show Me the Money

&#x200B;

*It is totally impossible to be well-dressed in cheap shoes.*

** Hardy Amies**

&#x200B;

Why spend 100 bucks on a [polo shirt](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/embroidered-cuban-collar-polo-shirt-mens-vega-in-ecru-cream/?category_id=1111&gaEeList=M%20-%20Tops) when you can get 8 for that price? Well, the answer is easy  for 100 bucks, you get quality in terms of design, materials and fit that will last. For 12 bucks, you get a [poorly fitting polo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Lavendar-XX-Large/dp/B07N4P9DS6/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=polo+shirt&qid=1585770945&sr=8-8) made from low grade materials that looks like it cost 12 bucks and - after a few washes - is worthless. One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you.

The difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1). These are two areas where you simply cannot skimp on. [Cheap shoes](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) kill any outfit stone dead. [Cheap jackets](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) are just as bad. Theres a reason why you pay more for leather, wool and cotton - its practically impossible to look good in man made synthetic materials like polyester, pleather and acrylic.

If you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear.

&#x200B;

**Shop online**

A retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need  good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why.

Youre also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain.

So shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe  youll never wear it.

&#x200B;

**Never Go Full Retail**

All designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack  wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites.

Other places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail.

6275,6276,Porn can't file false harassment  or rape accusations if she doesn't find you attractive!!,1
4035,4036,"She'll never tell you what she really means.I come back to this sub after a 2 year hiatus of regular dwelling. I checked in from time to time, but I never stopped reading books, learning and improving myself.  
  
First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

watch bhavani bhavai, mirch masala, rudaali n many more. 3. let’s look at
patriarchy & other stupid evils as in movies - all karva chauth scenes ever,
lavish weddings n songs, success at any cost, all super fit heroes & heroines,
the list is endless. these are subliminal & vicious more damaging than
anything. 4. flawed characters are just that - characters in a story arc. we
have flawed protagonists in darr, baazigar, anjaam, devdas, dev d, raging
bull, taxi driver, wolf of wall street, a clockwork orange, so many more. it’s
just a movie. 5. do haunted houses shown means we never buy them or that
ghosts exist ? there’s free will & free choice. 6. what’s bigger cheating -
saying that you are catering to family & make movies like race3, thugs of
hindustan, zero, kalank, tubelight & cheat audience of non engaging bullshit.
or dada kondke, mithun movies which know their audience - engaged or
entertained them, though not to everyone’ s taste. but they were not cheating
their audience. 7. an actor becomes a muslim to marry 2nd time, so many actors
have extramarital affairs, so many actresses break homes & marry a married
person. nepotism, corruption is always ok when it’s personal but not in public
domain. should we be boycotting all these to set an example ? 8. i felt
disappointed when laila majnu, sonchidiya flopped & bodyguard, raja hindustani
etc. made money. in terms of technicalities & acting skills kabir singh is
good, trying a narrative which is engaging at times & cringy at others. this
will work overall for sure. why look for political correctness all the time ?

homosexual will get what they want but kids who are sexually confused who are
not born gay will think it's ok. look at america. an 3th grader saying she
thinks she is lesbian because when she sees male she thinks she is not
attracted. believe me if you watch gays on tv and society it'll get disturbed.
a fine line has to be drawn. it all starts with a small thing and it has too
many consequences. the people who are born gay i'm not against them.. just
look at them anyone can tell they are born gay they didn't have a choice.",1

730,731,"Try approaching in locations that aren't so socially unacceptable first (malls, groecry stores, bookstores, concerts, etc...).  Street approach is obviously less normal/harder. Open with a light compliment about a unique object of clothing (never compliment her body, eyes, or hair) she's wearing or an indirect situational observation/question.  Then cold read some things about her (""you look like a (insert occupation here/______ major)"").  If she isn't receptive smile, say ""have a nice day"" and move on.  If she isn't showing any sign she wants you to go away, take the convo towards finding a common interest.  If you find one, ask for her number to do that interest together.  If she says no, say ""take it as a compliment"" and eject.  

Approach instantly too (3 seconds rule), because lingering or following her around the store to approach is creepy.  Also try approaching in different locations as to avoid running into the same girls over and over.  And don't go for a hug or anything physical on the approach (but do hold strong eye contact).",1

6097,6098,"i think people in the comment section are missing the point here. it’s not
about showing a character like arjun reddy, but about the subtext behind the
story. the subtext tries to make a “hero” without identifying the abuse he is
doing. let’s look at an example here. sardar khan in gangs of wasseypur forces
himself on nagma, and nagma falls in love too with him. same foreground, but
let’s look at the subtext. sardar khan has been portrayed as this dark twisted
character by the director. he’s still a likable character but the director
never shies away from discussing his dark behavior as it is. the subtext is
aware of his wrong doings and that’s why it’s okay. now, no one is asking
filmmakers to be overt feminists like kashyap is. i mean nagma does use sardar
for sex, and does start a family with him, for her character has been shown to
be attracted to this abusive guy in the society filled with similar folks. she
decides to marry him and get some leverage in the society. it’s her decision
that the audience can study. rather, kashyap later goes in develop her as this
badass woman who gets sardar killed when she gets wronged. a sudden
development of a strong female character without breaking realism. arjun reddy
is distasteful in 2017-19 era. films like these were a norm till the last
decade. it’s just sad to see people gravitating towards such regressive
thoughts. this conversation also takes me back to javed akhtar’s fantastic
argument breaker. he says don’t get into why the film is bad. but ask people,
if there was no abuse in his actions against women as such, then what was it
that made millions of men get titilated by it. javed used this argument for
pragya thakur’s nomination. he said people are saying pragya doesn’t have
those cases proven against her. to that javed said you ask those people, if
she didn’t do those things, then why is liked. it’s because you think she did
that against the muslims she is famous. or else why is she a hit. a kind of a
twisted analogy, but try to understand it. arjun reddy type films should have
become obsolete, but ....well.",1
