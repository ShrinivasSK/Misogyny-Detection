for quite a long time but this review was shit. Nobody wants to watch the
movie for reality or blah. You dont watch movies for inspiration you would
rather read books and biographies. Yes its true that some people are getting
influenced and doing all shitty fuckery but just think. Anyone who takes this
movie seriouslyis already a chutiya. And you dont go to theatre in india for
some reality shit and if u really seek reality and logical scripts and
characters without plotholes and all then you wouldnt be watching kabir singh.
So I think you just made this for views,  
cause theres no need for this so called raw review. And one thing you acted
like u forgot the movie name like seriously you know the whole story and you
pronounced this overhyped mess wrongly? Oh common!!!😂",0

32,33,"I literally cannot imagine a scenario where I'd be watching content from this
channel, leave alone penning down a comment. I personally abhor this
propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times.
It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital
platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get
certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and
Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that
the news channels alone can provide.",0

saw arjun reddy yesterday on amazon and for one i had to pause whenever
character speak bcoz d subtitles were too fast i didnt have time to read the
whole thing.  
Secondly i didnt like arjun ka character- womZaniser, drug addict,
alcoholic.and very abusive.  
Thirdly, by saying i like thia girl in particular clothing and then going from
class to class plus the girl's hostel and giving it the name of love isn't
love at all and it's CREEPY like srk chasing after kajol in DDLJ.  
Fourth point, after repeated pleas by his parents, he still drinks and smokes.  
He was shown in a negative light....but atleast there was a courtroom scene.  
And he is proud to say that while he was high none of his patients died?
Seriously?  
He slapped a girl when it wasnt expected at all. He was very regressive. Not
only regressive but spoilt, unapoligetoc and obnoxious.  
One time watch but yet inspite all this i could see the effort made by the
makers.

230,231,"I agree with you but I have a point too. Before elaborating my point, I want
to let you know that I'm here after seeing the ""Joker Movie analysis"". I
firmly believe the male character in Kabir Singh was irresponsible and doesn't
have any reflection with real life or practicality. As you said in the later
part of this video, ""if you're in relationship and your partner is self
derogating then run as fast as possible."" Don't you think this line defy your
Joker analysis, where you appraised/empathize Joker's mental state and called
the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of
person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would
our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir
Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality
disorder. In the movie ""principal"" told the class about his Anger management
issue.
Kabir also has emotional/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him
precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian
suffer from depression; 5 out of 100.
Hope you understand what I'm trying to say. Peace ☮️",0

268,269,"@Arnab: Do you know what are the plans of Govt with the Illegal immigrants?
How would a refugee prove religious persecution? Why have we shown selective
compassion?  
Do you really think it is the right time for India to do an activity like NRC
given the facts that almost 20% population are below poverty line and 30% of
adult population are still illiterate which constitutes more than 50% Women
who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time
such exercise would be of any beneficial to India? Don't you think the CJI and
GOI has wasted our huge 16K Cr rupees in this unsuccessful exercise and if we
live the money aside, look at the extent of trouble and pain people went in
Assam due to this.  
The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC
and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions
added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process.  
You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart and
raises alarm. Is there no value of human life on this land anymore?  
  
I strongly Oppose NRC, Oppose CAA amendment in the current situation.  
Was there any effective effort from GOI to stop the infiltration?  
  
GOI is just find ways to treat us like goats every now and then.  
  
I know, this questions should be thrown at GOI, however, as I see you a so
called representative of the GOI most of the time, so, I am throwing this on
you.  
Moreover, whats wrong with you getting stuck in this stupid debates on who
told what. Everyone around us promote lies everyday. Nobody really bothers
that anymore. Starting from PM to HM to Activist everyone promotes lies
everywhere but no facts. So, Arundhati is no different, where we cannot trust
the PM/CJI for that matter, who is Arundhati in that league. No one cares
about her. I stopped watching your channel, just thought of looking over today
for a change, but nothing changed. Same insensitive arguments and false
narratives. I wish I could say alternate narratives, but I see them clearly to
be false.  
Also JFYI, I supported the change in Govt, but really regretting now. I dont
support any political party anymore. So, please dont ask me why didn't I speak
during UPA rule. I dont have to answer that to you.",0

336,337,"You have gone beyond limits this time Pratik. You should not talk about
feminism and liberalism when you have no idea of what it is! I am surprised
beyond anything to see the comments supporting your views and number of
followers you have.  
  
Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit
of a common sense are hurt-  
1\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie.  
According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can
just impose whatever you like on her?  
2\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country,
let alone the question of feminism in that scene.  
  
And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned.
For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for
killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be
considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse.  
  
So don't go on spreading insanity you naive person. Just read more and expand

arises when people get tired of the natural process. And this is basically
because of the arising pornography and vulgarity that is openly viewed and
displayed and majority are prone to it so when they grow tired of the nature,
they tend to find pleasure in something that goes against nature. So we need
to support good and decent content on media and promote early marriages to
abstain from this taboo. And ofcourse this homosexuality is a sign of the day
of judgement as we Muslims believe so we need to seek forgiveness and thank
Allah for His blessings.

Team Nexus is an NGO (Non profit Non GOVT organization), engaged in social

minor domestic disputes / tussle / allegations etc. These Families suffer
trauma and depression in their attempts to be together again. Our first
priority is to save the family by mending the bitter relationship and also
know the reality of the allegations irrespective of gender. We directly or
indirectly help others to, support the main victims of domestic dispute and
domestic violence. Family tension affects people from all walks of life
regardless of gender, sexual orientation or race. Men, in particular, suffer
because of the lack of recognition and awareness by society and often the lack
of local services available to support them. It is a travesty of justice; we
cannot silently ignore because we've felt the sting of false accusations made
by women of domestic violence or anti dowry act (498A), and resolved to try to
prevent this injustice from continuing. We haven't been able to stop it, but
we wish to help male victims to fight against injustice side of the system.

but Mother keeps quiet and lives by him regardless because she loves him.
Actually the love of the women here is far more than the men. In this film the
female character she see Gabir beyond his flaw that’s what the film is about.
That’s why we need to see love beyond flaws. so Gabir Singh with with all his
flawed character there was a women who still liked him. That’s why some people
liked it.  
  
There were already many films like this already made in Tamil films over the
last decade the idea was to appeal the audience with a male dominated
character to show how an angry person who lives a gal madly and has changed
over the time. The only film that showed this very sensibly was acted by Surya
in the film Mohabbat Ke Dushman another film was acted by Vikram in Tamil film
called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir
Singh is actually a rip off from these Two characters nothing more also the
female characters was also rip off from the female characters from these two
films who were timid characters. So here you go the director got the idea of
writing Arjun Reddy from these two films.",0

504,505,"Homosexuality : is it natural ?[困]

Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .

The Question that should be asked is,
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?

Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him
& His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .

i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.

the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30
minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.

Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.

Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?

it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation.

The Bible clearly says ,he changed the ""TRUTH"" of God into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking
around with broken wrists .

since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.

Scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,We have seen that ""Thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.

So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.

There is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created.",1

According to indian constitution we have three genders and homosexuality is
legal in India so if someone is saying NO to homosexuality or transgenders
this means they are not obeying the indian constitution.  
  
I was NCC cadet and when we are in NCC we get a news that army officers or
soldiers sometimes they sexually abuse to girlish or an innocent I am the
witness I saw this and heard during the NCC period.  
Next I have made physical relationship with men who were or still they are
working with defence forces. So no one can come forward and say that in
defence we have no homosexual. There are but they are in closet.  
Second there are many news where soldiers abused or physically harassed girls
so no one can say that if homosexual will join defence so they will tease the
or harass the straight soldiers.  
  
Homosexual people are normal they are not prostitute who need Sex all the
time.  
  
Please don’t respect transgender and homosexual people if you don’t want  
But at least respect your constitution who legalised them

I hope you all get my message well.  
Last year in April I have arranged for my sister's wedding. We all were happy
and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their
demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband
and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from
Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times
police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become
innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my
sister. One day she told ""Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die
because of their torture and painless beat"". Then I have decided to go for
police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We
have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then
police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against
them so that they can feel guilty about their did.  
  
HOW CAN ANYONE SAY POLICE WILL TAKE ACTION SERIOUSLY? NOW POLICE HAS MORE
CHANCE TO DO CURRUPTION.  
  
IN INDIA DOWRY IS STATUS. I CAN BET 99.99% OF MARRIAGE CASE BOY WILL NOT
MARRIED WITH GIRL WITHOUT DOWRY. BECAUSE DOWRY IS NOT ONLY DOWRY IT'S STATUS

3\. Telling the girl of your dreams that I will kiss your mother and sister  
  
4\. Making her stay at a guys' hostel, apparently out of the care for her  
  
5\. Boasting about the fact that he had alcohol every time before he performed
the more than 500 surgeries, without a single one going awry!

black and blue, except for his father. As all this happens, the college

1\. You are not conservative. You are liberal . You are just scared of the
word but you are liberal. I have same thought as you but i call myself as
liberal. Dude your thoughts are liberals. Most of the thing you said about
liberal is not true  
. Things like nudity and stuff. Indigenous tribe who live naked doesn't know
anything. So i dont expect you to tell me what to wear.  
2\. Vedas are bullshit. Do u think god wrote the vedas? I am an atheist. If u
start questioning vedas you will find it just a book written by prosperous
people to control the entire community. How can u relate Mathematics with
vedas? Pls dont tell me calculus was invented by vedas.  
3\. people of indus valley civilization didn't have any Hindu gods. Vedas are
written after indus valley civilization. And zero was in use in Nile Valley
Civilizations too. I can't say who used it first.  
4 . Liberals oppose war. And you think its a bad thought. On man oh man.. god
save me although i dont believe in god.  
5\. Vietnam war ......? Seriously... Do u know anything about Vietnam war?  
6\. I respect aadiwasi ritual and belief system. Far more logical than hindus
but मुझे आदिवासियों के अंधविशवासों प्र विश्वास नहीं। इसलिए मै खुद को
conservative नहीं कह सकता आपकी liberal वाली defination से मै खुद को liberal भी
नहीं कह सकता क्यों की liberal वह नहीं जो आप बता रहे हो। I love my country and
my indigenous culture . The thing is we liberals respect every country and
their culture.. लेकिन कहना तो सिर्फ इतना है कि यदि रीति रिवाजों में कुछ कमिया

projected as heroic and manly for molesting, suppress or objectifying women,
let our leading ladies have the fun!! Or else let wrong be wrong , no matter
which sex it comes from and stay neutral rather than justifying a male
character and further inflating male ego and their superiority complex!! But
on a more serious note I don’t think every liberals or feminists comes from a
place of hating men just like how every conservative does not come from a
place of hating women!! Let night he ideologies be used where they are
needed!! Why do people have to be so rigid, timid and regressive as well as
extremists in following an ideology ( liberal or anti-liberal) for that
matter!!! Let’s be more welcoming of change for better and accommodating of
age old traditions which are actually good and holistic!!",0

1030,1031,"Hello Pratik,  
You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and
the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts,
situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal
level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very
existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but
at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so
important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or
dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the
opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we
should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all
educated and well read people) in a public domain? Aggression is good when
applied cleverly and certainly not in unidimensional rage.

I watched the movie today and I don't feel that it's anyway hurting 'the so-
called feminist ego'. Instead the entire movie is all about acknowledging the
character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love
for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed
Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life
Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I
really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the
air. Instead I support true feminism--equality for both the sexes, male as
well as female without any kind of discrimination on any ground. Also,
negative values are negative for everyone.. Irrespective of men and women.",0

1798,1799,"Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not
follow western culture(even banned in Christianity).  
Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can
only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big
misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's
genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be
genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a
gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of
nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind
later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries
earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who
fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had
multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started
getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor
he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven
that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout
your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us
a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments.
So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it
in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their
opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a
mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy
psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just
to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the
rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue
our sexual and spiritual life.  
At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the
Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be
legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature
given laws and the Truth of life.

move on from someone whom he truly loved. They are separated because of the
prevailing stereotypes. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has studied psychology himself,

surgeon’s downfall and his resurgence. The scene where he doesn’t want to
plead not guilty because his professionalism is the only thing his father
respected about him is very emotional and brings out the good nature of
Kabir/Arjun.

2054,2055,"@Ankit Dass This controversy is not even needed. It's a story about a
fictional character and let's just simply appreciate the hardwork they have
put into it. The character undergoes a proper development and it is shaped
well and has been put wonderfully by Shahid Kapoor. It's a journey of a Man
dealing with consequences of lost love. It does not actually 'promote'
anything. It's simply a story and its better to see a fiction as a fiction. I
personally love both his and Sucharita's review but like I loved Sucharita's
review on Mard ko dard nahi hota and I hated his review about Kedarnath.

they see in movies and blaming Bollywood is wrong.Movies and shows have a
great impact on society around the world.When 'The Exorcist' released in
1973,it had such a cultural impact.There is a documentary made on it.People
flocked in theaters to watch that film only because it got word of mouth
publicity for being the scariest movie of it's [time.It](http://time.it/) was
banned in several places but people still took buses to watch the movie in the
next town.The show 'Game Of Thrones', 'Breaking Bad' and 'Dexter' had a lot of
impact on people.They have fan clubs for superhero movies.A lot of people were
committing murders after watching 'Dexter' series.'Gone Girl' inspired a lot
of people to commit similar crimes.'Titanic' had that same effect on people
who were gushing over 'Jack & Rose' romance.K-Pop and K-drama has forced a lot
of women around the world to believe in fairytale romance and they are all
travelling to Korea to find a Korean bf/husband.Japanese manga and anime has a
huge cultural impact on people around the [world.So](http://world.so/),I
personally believe that you are being a little too harsh on Indians for loving
Bollywood.Most Indians are middle class or lower middle class people who are
struggling in their daily life.Sometimes reality is very harsh so they watch
these over the top movies to escape their reality.I do agree that these
cliched romance movies are very misleading and men and women both fall for

2329,2330,"Totally agreed with your practicality but there are many subtle things that
actually shows how bad the character is and how he suffers for that. You
actually said a lot of things wrong:  
1\. He understands how wrong his attitude is  
2\. Looses his license even though he could have lied and won the case; this
shows how the character matures and starts to remorse his attitude  
3\. He is a kind of person who runs away from a complex situation but at the
end he never wanted to bring that as an excuse (had it not been his friend,
girl would have never known). He did wrong and he realised.  
4\. Totally wrong when you say he is abusing his parents. The ending parts
shows how his relation with father changed.  
5\. Totally wrong when you say he used to stalk that girl even after breakup.
He never does that even though he is unable to move on  
6\. If u see the movie you will understand how he started hating himself. A
man who is narcissistic by nature when he starts to be ashamed of his
personality and attitude, its a very big positive change.  
7\. Okay i agree he ends up getting the girl in a very unrealistic way, but
the scene where he is ready to accept the baby and give him a father without
anything spoken shows the purity in his love (i agree the ripening of the
relationship was very bollywood typical though)  
8\. yes agreed that he was self harming but nowhere did he let the girl know
about it and hence force her to take any decisions based on that. The person
is fake masculine i agree but not manipulative so you cant call it abusive
relationship.  
9\. This guy cares so much about the girl that he rubs her shoulder after
removing her heavy bag.  
10\. The girl had equal domination rights in him as well. She slaps him when
he was out of control angry in a public place and he starts to apologise. I am
sorry I do see a trait of matured and very mentally intimate relationship
here.  
11\. I agree his background was typical bollywood but again as you mentioned
if he was not so pampered he would not have done all the blunders (a humble
background would end up seeing him in jail and maybe a underworld don
biography can be written after that), so to give the film all the colours he
had to belong to a family of means. How about 50 shades of grey as an example
!  
12\. Apparently he never reads(according to you) but how about the fact that
he took her and taught her a lot during a song and never tried to take
advantage of her (she made the first move which shows her agreement). Its also
shown even though he tries to be masculine he never really could face the girl
for long, he was not comfident till the girl agreed.  
13\. You need to agree that girl enjoyed the character and hence he could be
what is portrayed. And hence like kabir (which i do consider a realistic
flawed person), preeti is also a very real character, silent but manipulative.  
14\. Regarding that sex scene. Thats a typical example of rape. Many rapist
actually raped when they were mentally unstabled adding physical needs
(hormones) on top of that. But he says he is sorry and leaves (he dis wrong
but he realises, isnt that good? Isnt that what a normal person should do?)  
15\. He is tharki? Yes he is ... its his sadness mixed with hormones, a very
typical situation of being desparate. But that same person never wanted to go
into a fake relationship, isnt that honesty and maturity? He never wanted to
hurt anyones feelings like his were hurt. All he wants is sex! Isnt that what
hookup culture is in modern Metros? People hookup even without any mental
desparation, just for fun. Why is that not a very real situation then?  
  
Please feel free to couter attack me with a debate. But till then your reviews
are as flawed and biased as the charecter of kabir.  
Ps. I am a big fan of ur work and not a narcissist sympathizer. Dont worry man
todays youth gets enough dose of dumb sexual contents. They are gullable. And
sex sells, thats truth, hence is sold by bollywood. Kabir singh dint sell dumb
sex atlst and is a masterpiece for acting skills. Maybe watch Vijaya
dervakonda in arjun reddy. Takes a lot of effort to get in the shoes of those
villain charecters, should appreciate that before calling it garbage. Ranvir
was great actor since his charecter lost in padmavati but shahid is shit
because his charecter finally gets love? Totally hypocrisy",0

effect of loneliness , frustation of repressed masculinity , toxic outburst

2660,2661,"@smart prabudh dixit the problem with ""Indians"" is that they are very
emotional people. When a kid in his teens sees one of these so called
""romantic bollywood films"", it is bound to play with his mind.  
  
In this scenario, i certainly won't blame the directors or producers, because
I'm sure they may have great scripts, but the audience in India is such that
they dont want to see that. They don't support it, they dont like it. They
want to see that typical ""mirchi masala"" movie and they dont want to think
beyond that. In such a situation, the cinema industry has no option but to
comply with them.  
  
I think its high time we open up our narrow thinking. I saw Joker yesterday,
and oh boy was that a masterpiece. I find it hard to believe that we dont have
such brilliant ideas, but bringing it to the big screens is the biggest
problem. I can do nothing but hope that one day, bollywood moves on and gives
a chance to better projects. Kudos!",0

2814,2815,"What people don't realize is that if Kabir Singh made you feel uncomfortable,
it was supposed to. It did exactly what it set out to do. With Arjun Reddy and
now Kabir Singh, the director Sandeep Vanga is only exhibiting a different
kind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist
who's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey
rather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his
perspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right,
wronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the
same basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the
movie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That
it's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny.  
  
  
Throughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost
feeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by
his self-inflicted agony. Vijay/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this
torment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues
till the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any
kind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn
by finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't
find anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way
glorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and
repulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his
lifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as
a person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering
misogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message
instead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You
literally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting
characters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while
trying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact
a very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed
man, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch-
black. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a
positive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the
rock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at
his lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered
a personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the
choice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for
eternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus
the film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of
its runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life.  
  
For all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said
earlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and
technical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience.  
  
  
I wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with
an open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially
since this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to
distort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when
they are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like
Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society.

2901,2902,"Dear Pratik,  
Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men
and humanising terrorists and what not. The cultural values you keep referring
to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially
in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape
accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed  
two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is
exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing
a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know
feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said?
As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's
family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage
with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a
girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively
because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a
heroic romance then god bless you. God save you.  
Sincerely,  
A feminist",0

2947,2948,"Actually this movie is different because..in other Bollywood romantic movies
hero fights with 100 villains for heroine..or heroine's father is the villain
who hires a gang who will beat hero and then hero will fight and prove his
love...kabir singh is at least different in this case...and Kabir singh is
rude and short tempered..that's his fault and director portrayed the impact in
movie..and the suffering is also portrayed..this movie does not influence boys
to do whatever Kabir singh does...if anybody gets inspired..then he will be
also inspired to kill people by only playing PUBG
And one more thing it is at least better than those shitty Bollywood movies in
which hero fights villains without any weapons(like he is superman).at least
something is different from the previous Bollywood romantic movie trend..
please support that.and you are talking about the behaviour of a real human
being is not portrayed? Who stays confused in his life? I think you have not
seen the movie till the last minute..Kabir Singh who was rude from the first
he also cries at a time when everything was going out of his hand..so it shows
hero gained some lesson from his past and audience should take this as lesson
from the movie.

Youth... I don't say dark character should not be shown in movies but showing
its consequences is necessary too...  
The problem with kabir singh is not with the negativity of the character, but
with the people buying into the negativity. People are proclaiming him the
HERO and is glorifying him as an inspiration!  
Kabir treated Peeeti as his Toy, his 'Bandi'. Kabir at no point asks preeti
for her consent regarding his forcing her to be into relationship with him,
which can mislead many men too, even lots of girls will find it cute too..  
Imagine a Kabir Singh in your Life!!!  
My Problem is not with the movie or character but the character is so real
that it can lead to birth of so many Kabir Singh in real life which is
regressive to the society..  
The character is celebrated as a romantic lead which is dangerous if subjected
to real life, people are finding his actions , his abuse, hus anger cool.. his
negativity is celebrated but thats really wrong.. his character is so real
that it can provoke men in our country...  
Kabir Singh is a masterpiece, Acting is Fabulous, but In reality I don't
support such person, but today's youth especially boys will consider this cool
& heroic which is a threat..

good movie. If a women is shown drinking then it is very bad and against
cultural values but if kabir singh is shown as a drinker and smoker then we
should be proud of the movie. Kabir singh is threatening everybody that preeti
is my lady, nobody should come close to her and thats a morally right thing
acc. to you. Wow, what hypocrisy. I know the movie is about negative side of
kabir singh but unfortunately this side of kabir singh has been highlighted in
a very stylished misogynistic way. In this film one thing is clearly shown
that women should like and look for dominating and possessive lovers. If same
role will be based on a women then u will obviously have problems, you will
see it as a unculturable and non traditional thing. Why women should always be
shown in submissive roles. 99% of movies in india are based on male point of
view but if 1% of movies are based on female point of view, their liberties,
why everybody has problem in that. This is true hypocrisy. Atlast i want to

3241,3242,"Bro you should watch that movie again just to clear some facts. When Kabir
meets Preeti in the end, she tells her about her residence in some hostel and
she worked in a clinic. Movies are not always meant to connect them with
reality and teach us lessons ( I admit some movies do that). Some are meant to
enjoy. The movie shows an excellent chemistry between two guys with some mind
blowing romantic songs, how much more do you expect from it bro? Nothing is
perfect bro.  
As you said person should ideally move on immediately after break up (in one
of the videos you said in a slang way that, “khat khat move on karna chahiye
mard ko""), I am with you bro. But it would take 3-4 months for a guy and it’s
normal. Kabir Singh here takes his time say 7-8months (not too much for even a
fictional story), and then they marry. He developed smoking and drinking habit
but even in that time he worked. Yeah one thing you exaggerated about medical
students (they didn’t get time of all this). I being a medico can say that we
get time for our relationships and we also live as a social animal. (I am not
proving you wrong but you just exaggerated the fact).",0

3643,3644,"All those feminists who are criticising the film did not understand at all the
meaning of the film. Nowhere did the director tried to justify Kabir Singh or
tried to portray him as a great human being. It's the story of a flawed
character, his downfall to the path of self destruction and final redemption.
Actually for me it's quite an inspiring story. We all have inner flaws and
demons within us and are constantly fighting with them. Kabir Singh became a
victim of his inner demons which led to his downfall. But its inspiring to see
his final redemption after controlling all his inner demons.  
So I request all feminists to have some basic knowledge about films before
trying to criticize. They should watch the Oscar Winning film of Robert de
Niro 'Raging Bull' before judging Kabir Singh.

3655,3656,"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and
I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect.",0

you'll say what I want to say but I can't stop myself commenting this that the
dashing and attractive look of shahid is shown in the movie which makes youth
think that they'll still manage to have that attractiveness ( Thick looking
beard, good hairs, those muscles and overall personality) in them even after
abusing drugs is so fake. And in reality if people start abusing drugs than
they'll become so unattractive bcoz reality will slap them so hardly and those
drugs would make you go bald, loose those muscles, loose ur charm, loose ur
social life, make you a failure in ur career and you won't even get that
respect as Kabir singh got in the movie)

should be appreciated too. Considering him so great, publicising him as a
macho dude is in a way whitewashing every wrong thing in him and due to this i

4228,4229,"Seems like you have also watched Sucharita's review !  
However, as a female I would have certainly wanted the lead actress to have
bit stronger character. But critically speaking, this movie is solely based on
an individual's story. The name itself is Kabir Singh. Secondly, we have seen
such rowdy and complicated female characters in Hindi Movies, just like
Tannu's character.  
Now without taking any sides, I would like to state that movies should be
watched critically, and should never have emotional connection if we want to
review.  
And I agree with your review and your explanation of the movie.  
This time I honestly watched the movie before watching any reviews. And it's a
good movie with good character development. Good story line. And it's a story
of an individual.  
This movie is solely meant for commercial success. And I am also not happy
about the over critical feminist reviews.

like kabir Singh marks preeti as his territory without asking her, are we all
guys not taught to ask girls out properly. There are many guys who think it's
okay to act this way, because preeti did not have a problem. But what if a
girl says no, guys will take on their ego and harass a girl till she says Yes.
I have sisters who faced this. This sends out a very wrong message, and guys
learn it indirectly. That's why everyone is fighting for it. There are a lot
of things wrong with other movies too, but Lets not take that and defend this
movie. Lets pinpoint stuff if anything is wrong to get better content which

promote negativity in society subliminally or openly it needs to be called out
and criticised openly. Some will say ""Oh it is just a film."" But many people
DO take these movies seriously and it does affect as well as change their
lives. So though I disagree with Pratik regarding some movies, I hugely

I loved it. I loved the hell out of it.  
  
Not because I fanboy over Kabir Singh and his dominating ways. Not because I
liked how he controlled over the entire college campus and marking the girl.
No. If I'd met someone like Kabir Singh, I'd have never accepted him.  
  
I loved because of the storytelling itself. It wasn't a usual story of boy
meets girl, face problems, get married, over. I loved how flawed both
characters were because of which it felt so real at some parts. You could feel
the emotions, the anxiety, the chemistry between the two leads. In many
movies, you don't really feel for a couple. Like they r just put out there for
the sake of the movie. But here they made sense in their own imperfect ways. I
loved how flawed Kabir was. It made him more human. I hated his ways but over
the course of time, so many things happen to him and he does Grow.  
  
I don't know why some critics think this movie is glorifying anger, macho
behaviour, dominance and alcohol. In the movie, no one encourages to do these
things. Infact, if I remember correctly, his parents, brother, friends,
principal-- all of them tell him to STOP. They clearly state it's WRONG. And
he faces the CONSEQUENCES for that. His temporary suspension from college, his
father throwing him out of the house, a case registered against him, losing
his medical license for a few years-- these were all the result of his
behaviour and habits. Very later on, if these Kabir haters observed, they
would see a GROWTH in his behaviour. He stops drinking, gathers a little
patience and reflects on his life. If he was a totally shit character to you
ppl, he wouldn't have told the truth during the court hearing. He wouldn't
have felt guilty at all and would have continued to behave like that. Despite
his issues, he cared for his patients.  
  
As for his behaviour with Preeti, he was sweet and loving with her, most of
the time. Yes, he claimed her and all in the beginning, he never once FORCED
her anything. Preeti wasn't obligated to anything, you see. If she didn't like
going out with him, she would have refused it from the get go. But she clearly
LIKED it. It was her personal choice. Kabir slapped her but Pretti slapped him
too- Multiple times. It was Preeti who made the first move to kiss him. It was
Preeti who begged him not to go. Was that Kabir doing it too? Both of them
faced many things. They deserved their happy ending.

that bitch and their family members who filed false case against him.Now this
is the only way left for justice in india.Now indian bitches will marry to
innocent man to make shortcut money and have their husband as slave.If man
denies to be a slave of her then he and his famly will be threaten by false
dowry case and ask millions of money in revenge. PROSTITUTES ARE MUCH MUCH
BETTER THEN THESE MARRIED BITCHES, at least these prostitutes makes money in a
honest way and do not cheat their customers and do not spoil their family at
all but these bitches asks millions in the favors of getting fucked for few
nights and their parents who are retired and brother who is in drugs and do
not make any money then for these basterds teach this bitch girl to marry a
innocent guy and get fucked for few nights and then fuck their in laws family
by putting false dowry case so brides family can feed their self with the
money got as compromise called ""REVERSE DOWRY "".After getting money as
settlement these bitches and their family starts hunting for another man
.Indian judicial system knows everything but do not want to do anything and
makes money out of it..sure every one will get lesson because every one has
son and daughter and their daughter in law files the same dawry case against
their son then they will realize and learn the lesson.The people are too
scared to marry a girl once get married and if threaten by girl to file false
case then it will happen that people will kill her and her family before going
to jail after all once they charged in false dowry case then there is no
chance left for compromise except kill them all as only left option as JUSTICE
.so now its upto indian court what they want? do they want to keep these
bitches filling false case one by one and get killed by their husband ???or
court will have the option to do proper investigartion before arrest and if
the bride is convicted then file the case against her and her family and give
them life imprisonment because death penelty is too less for them..God save

to show how the character handled the situation not how it should be handled &

I myself as a girl found out to be wrong therefore i didn't even watch the
whole series unlike you. You can't compare a web series with a film. Films are
meant to put impact on people & what Kabir Singh shows is disgusting because
he kept on calling preeti ki she is my Bandi she doesn't have her own
personality (i know why you ppl liked this movie because it's India).  
Third: Do you liked movie veere di wedding??????? As a girl I didn't watch
movie because it literally showed girls being a bit more sort of bad. You ppl
still comment on Swara Bhaskar's masturbation scene & troll her despite of her

toxic man who might have beaten women or you are supporting movie only because
some anti modi people criticized it (this reason is even worst)Moreover, being
a feminist or liberal has nothing to do with political party or ideology. I am
proud liberal & feminist who don't support extremists or separatist who
support Afzal or Burhan as well as another bunch of extremist like you who
will defend even a rapist may be, just to be anti feminist. Shame on you for
supporting a character who is kissing & misusing a fresher without her consent
but at the end he is shown as true lover. People like this are main reason
behind rapes & domestic violence & it's supporter like you are also part of
it.  
People like you are biggest hypocrite because you people will start blabbering
about Sanskar after watching 4 more shorts or Veere di wedding but proudly
defend a toxic masculinity character. If you are really honest person then
just for few minutes imagine a senior of your sister treating her like this in

tells you that she is sorry for all this toxicity?? Do answer if you will

5331,5332,"just wanna say, there is no gay gene. you can truly and seriously be cured by
accepting jesus as your savior. this gay agenda is everywhere on tv to
subliminally convince you to be interested to the same gender. oh and it's
also demonic. so it's spiritual as well. but if you keep yourself in the dark,
how will you prevail?",0
5332,5333,"well, if a one twin struggles with self confidence in a world where you should
be perfect, then both may come to the same conclusion. “because i’m not
meeting the standard, i’ll just be gay, so that i’ll fit in somewhere”. sperm
and egg are the scientific standard. all gay people can’t get over this. they
are mentally disabled.",0
5333,5334,"i am an identical twin and we are both homosexual. we knew since we were like
4 or 5. the only thing that was confusing is the lack of information
pertaining to homosexuality when we were growing up. it wasn't on tv. it
wasn't in school education. it wasn't explained in our home. it was just this
mysterious wisp concept that you had to figure out on your own. it's pretty
traumatic for a child. thank god society is waking up from the ignorance of
sexual repression.",0

the standard. then later on there happens to be these people who just want to
be different for the sake of it and choose to deviate and become gay hence the
choice. to put it clearly then would be to say, 'everyone is born heterosexual
and then they face the choice whether to remain so or not.'",1
5345,5346,"@iihamed711 homosexuality is a sexuality. so if they think someone chooses
their sexuality, then that basically means they chose to be heterosexual too.
and if that's the case, you may not actually be straight  
coz noone chooses their sexuality",1

because by nature homosexuals cannot reproduce and heterosexuals can.",1

be heterosexual. and if that's the case, then hate to break it to you, but you

with you people are that you fail to tell me how something natural and
harmless (aka homosexuality) is somehow morally wrong. you have no argument
whatsoever on how it is wrong for me to be in bed with a man. you only say it
is because of your feelings period. :) just admit it, the left is absolutely
right on this. :)",0
5359,5360,"@mrworldguyseriously dude, ""homosexuality is a choice."" that's the problem
with you people, you keep on trying to look for loopholes to defend them with.
it is evident that it is wrong but you are so hell-bent on making an inclusive
society that overlooks weaknesses that you've got to the point that you now
overlook basic facts or try falsify or trivialise them. it's just another case
of severe cognitive dissonance",0

you have a nasty disease to put your personal idea forward during interviews.
it makes me wonder why on earth you are allowed to interview people. instead,
you should speak your mind, alone. this very nature of your coward attribute
to hide behind some one else to express your own thoughts disgusted me. hope

misuse-of-laws?signed=true>  
  
women misusing laws against men in india for extortion, manipulation and
revenge/vendetta has become an epidemic that not only threatens the moral
fabric of our society but puts lacs of innocent men behind bars.  
  
lacs of innocent men are languishing behind bars in overcrowded jails, and
there are no laws to protect them or legal body to hear their anguish and
support them.  
  
our constitution states that we are all equal irrespective of caste, colour or
gender. however, we have laws that only protect women and no parallel laws to
protect men. in fact, pro-women laws are being misused to victimise men and
men have no real recourse under law.  
  
we need to put deterrents in place to prevent misuse of laws, victimisation of
men, and also to ensure gender neutral laws are put in place.  
  
[#mentoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mentoo) with pooja
bedi intends to push lawmakers to draft legislation in parliament to create
checks and balances in society that give men and their families equal
protection under law and punishment to those who misuse laws.  
  
please note; [#mentoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mentoo)
is not anti [#metoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo).
women who misuse laws and file false cases are a deterrent to women
empowerment movements.  
  
what needs to change?????  
  
1\. name of accused to be kept as confidential as victims name until proven
guilty.  
  
a woman who files a rape complaint gets her identity protected but the men
carry the hashtag of
[#rapist](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rapist) from moment
case is registered. not just them, the women in their families be it mother,
sister, wife, daughter all bear the brunt of his rapist hashtag. shockingly if
case is proven false, no real punishment is meted out the woman who has
destroyed the life, career, reputation of the man and put him and his family
through mental, emotional and physical torture. punishment for the woman can
be a mere 500 rupees.statistics are shocking.  
  
data by the delhi commission for women states 53.2% of rape cases filed in
delhi between april 2013 and july 2014 turned out to be false.  
  
2\. rape/ domestic violence cases filed post 3 months of date of alleged
rape/abuse to be treated differently and arrest only after investigation of
the same.  
  
most fake cases are filed after deliberation, plotting and connivance with
friends, family and lawyers.  
  
statistics claim almost 75 % of dv cases are false and according to ncrb data,
10% dowry cases filed each year are proven false. there are over 11 lac men
languishing in jails implicated in false cases.  
  
in 2013, out of the investigated 1,12,058 cases, 10,864 were false. and in
2012, 10,235 out of 1,03,848 were proven false. after this data was released,
the supreme court had observed that the law meant to combat the menace of
harassment of women by their husband or in-laws was often being used as a
“weapon rather than shield by disgruntled wives”. the ipc 498a being a
cognisable and non-bailable offence only worsens the plight of those falsely
accused. sections 354, 509 and 376 are there to protect women, and not to
terrorise innocent men.  
  
3\. severe penalty to put in place for women who have been proven to have
filed a fake case as deterrent to others.  
  
please note: there is a distinction between an acqquital on grounds of
insufficient evidence and when it is a proven false case.  
  
4\. creation of national commission for men.  
  
if women have a body that addresses their issues we need one in place for men
as well. data states that for for every 16 women who commit suicide 25 men
commit suicide.  
  
5\. introduce purushdhan which will give a man the same economic rights and
footing as streedhan.  
  
many cases are coming to light of women marrying men and within a few months
demanding divorce and large sums of money. they threaten a man and his family
under sections of 376, 354, 509 and 498a if they don't comply. the assets a
man is given by his famliy or what he has earned prior to marriage should be
considered his. only what is earned during their marriage should be part of a
divorce proceeding based on number of years spent together and whether kids
are involved.  
  
6\. right to prenuptial agreements  
  
currently pre nups are not legal as it absurdly gets challenged under bonded
labour laws. men are increasingly shying away from marriage as it means
extortion. clarity on money will bring rights and respect to both.  
  
7\. to clearly define rape  
  
there have been judgements stating that if a man is in a live in relationship
it can fall under rape. promise to marry and not marrying is equivalent to
rape. rape is a heinous crime and laws for it are stringent. we need to
clearly define rape.  
  
8\. palimony to be taken as seriously as alimony.  
  
if a man is not earning and a woman is, he should be entitled to palimony with
the same respect and laws that grant a woman alimony.  
  
9\. gender neutral laws to be implemented  
  
when men face domestic violence there is no law to support them even if they
submit videographic evidence. same with rape. men on men rape and women on men
rape needs to recognised especically when rape is defined as intercourse under
threat/coercion. also for sexual harassment laws in the workplace to be gender
neutral.  
  
men in india have been imprisoned not only by gender stereotyping but also a
lack of laws and no official body to hear their cries. men are human. and if
we want an equal society, equal relationships, equal justice, we need equal
laws.

but i think the scale of the two issues- actual rapes happening and the number
of false rape cases being reported should also be considered.  
while watching this trailer, the first thing that came to my mind is how
difficult it is a for a woman who's been raped to actually get an fir filed.
also, people commenting that women are considered innocent and men are
considered guilty is not true, since majority of the times women are blamed
for getting raped, that is, if they're believed at all.",0

5718,5719,"great initiative. kudos. all sides need a voice to maintain balance of
judgement. but let's talk about most of the comments here that's like ' i take
this golden opportunity to give slippershot to feminists'. kindly tell me, are
feminists conspiring and encouraging women to file fake cases? how is this
even a logical inference.  
  
people hear about false cases and simply assume it's just women exacting
revenge or exhorting money. in reality, the reasons are so much more complex.  
  
majority of false cases (according to the delhi study) are filed by parents of
eloping daughters especially if the boy belongs to another community or
religion in order to end their relationship. and these cases were then deemed
false because of testimony of the girl involved.  
false cases with women doing out of revenge is really the least common type.
but people talking about false cases only zoom in on this type.  
  
truth is we don't really have much reliable post verdict data of all this.
there's only this one study that too conducted for delhi courts alone. we need
to press for more data and research of into this area (root causes) to amend
the rape laws in a way that's justifiable. one of the amendments i would
support is removing 'breach of promise of marriage'  
  
please understand increase in fake cases do not correspond to decrease in real
rape cases. according to nhfs and ncrb reports not even 1℅ of sexual assaults
even get reported. i have interracted with rape victims and inspite of all the
laws favoring women, victims still find it difficult to navigate the legal and
social system after a rape. they are very ofen shut up, threatened and shamed.
there's a systemic problem of underreporting of rape.  
  
often in an attempt to support false case victims, people end up undermining
the frequency and severity of rape in the process.  
  
it's a good thing, fake cases are coming to light and people are fighting for
justice where it's warranted. but a fight for more fair treatment of men need
not necessarily turn into a stupid fight against feminism.

fake cases started against me i lost one by one everything , wasn't able to
move forward lost opportunities due to these bloody court dates,people started
using the opportunity to loot me knowingly i didn't want to fight with then

get tired soon ,i have proof for everything each and every punctuation marks
in the petitioners petition is lie i even have video and audio proofs to prove
my innocence,rti reports to prove forged documents were filed with the help of
cops to frame me in false cases ,but when will i get the opportunity to prove
it all false? only when the bloody trial starts until then i am guilty ,

gender biased law's the judge's, cops etc somehow love to torture innocent men

members for these organizations are torturing my family members also ,they are
threatening ,they even threathened my wife before my marriage knowing my
tragic life she stood for me and didn't dump me she was threatened by an lady
from some feminist organizations for marrying me she was even insulted at her
college because these ladies called and told all lies to her lectures she

i refuse to believe that all of these ""falsely accused"" ""india's sons"" are
actually purely innocent. additionally, when will we ever talk about the fact
that more often than not, these people get acquitted in the absence of any
physical evidence. get the ipc and study it carefully, falsely promising a
woman that you will marry her and then leaving her after having sex is rape;
forcing her to give consent/get her drunk to obtain consent is rape; even if
she consented (under any circumstances) but feels uncomfortable to go through
with it because of pain or any other factor, yet the boy keeps doing it, that
is rape. there's more than 10 circumstances that will be considered rape, in
the eyes of the law, but no, everything needs to be created at the male's
convenience. most women are of the same view that women are falsely accusing
men now. let it be decided by the judge, what's false, what's not. who are we
to perform a trial? haven't there been cases where an acquittal took place
despite the girl's repeated pleas that she was raped, which of us took a stand
for her? truth is, in this patriarchal society, men give us ""choices"" at men's
convenience to be followed by women for men's satisfaction. and of course,
when just a tiny population of men is actually sensitive and sensible, the
majority being little pieces of shit, it's not uncommon or unusual that even
the innocent (or ""innocent"") ones would get caught in the hurricane.",1

how?  
a woman can demand one night stands, with any random guy.. mutual consent,
still, next day, he could be behind the bars, because a drunken sexually
liberated woman's demand and consent , were gone with hang over! why?

far better if they tackle those 1000 problems and help those 1000 women by

not necessarily at the hands of a woman. add false accusation to that list and
this is something that everyone needs to be aware of. just like a woman who

1) calls it ""rape"" when men break a promise of marriage when it can be
demonstrated that sex was based on that promise.

5911,5912,"@navya patil you are talking about whom then you are referring to men or
women. you are talking about human beings then who are human beings there are
two genders in human beings male and female like that in other species too. if
any person keep false allegations on a person who is innocent that person
becomes the enemy of the humanity.  
look. according to me there are two genders males and females that's it i
don't give a damn about third gender. i am anti lgbt person who will oppose
them because i feel they are huge threat to humanity all women and men will
suffer if they get corrupted.  
according to me feminist is about the rights of girls that it not about men at
all. all i care about humanity,nature,wildlife and animals that's it. always
fighting for equality for education is fine,jobs fine if you have potential to
take care of the pressure no problem go ahead, but if you don't want to change
initial after marriage that is not acceptable you should always be called of
your husband name or his initial which i don't agree if anyone oppose that  
asking for father share of property ok no problem. but if men can marry
multiple women doesn't mean women can marry i will always be against the idea
. fighting for rights in everything is not acceptable. equality in good things
is ok i have full support but not in bad things also. always don't imitate men
for everything. few things ok. always crying over men that women are not
getting justice saying this is wrong.  
if you have potential to take care of both career and family equally then no
problem go ahead. if you are not able to balance both then forget about job.
just take care of children because children can be raise properly by women
more than men. if you want to get divorce though your husband not done
anything wrong then forget about asking money from him. if you are earning
money good then you have no right to ask money from your husband if you are
getting divorced.  
i am not feminist at all i agree women should fight for equality for few
things not everything. if men can do why can't we do. now men are drinking and
smoking try to stop them and don't become like them. if men are bribing try to
stop them don't do the same thing. if men are going for casino try to stop
them not do the same thing. if men are using drugs stop them not doing the
same thing etc.",0

false sexual harrasment accusations.  
  
police detains men just based on accusations with no evidence and only
releases until proven innocent.  
  
police does not detain women until they are proven guilty, and continue with
them without any evidence.  
  
plus the golddigger women who want to divorce after a short period of time and

5995,5996,"**l am a male victim of fake female rape charges**  
  
there was this girl who came from new delhi to stay at my neighbours house
with her cousins for a few weeks and we accidentally clicked and we began
eating out, watching movies, shopping, etc.  
  
she would call me at night and we would talk and laugh etc. as we stayed in
the same floor , she would directly pop into my house without knocking.  
  
fast forward, i was having a shower after my grindr hookup (a gay guy) went
away, now since i stay alone, i don't worry roaming around in the naked, i was
having my shower and she stood there watching me, the moment i noticed , she
acted as if she accidentally saw it. this was so uncomfortable !!!!  
  
next, i began noticing my underwear being stolen , never had this issue ever.  
  
then this girl began spamming me wierd messages which got me pissed. then she
left back for new delhi, she would video call me late at night in very
revealing outfits and i didn't quite like it. but i never had anything in my
mind so, i ignored it.  
  
the she began repeated visits all the way from new delhi to my neighbours (her
uncle) every fucking weekend , and would simply enter my house.  
  
one day, i was having sex with my new date (a man) , thankfully, i kept the
bedroom locked and this girl knocked it and stood out until i opened it , it
was so displeasing, that we had to dress up fast and act as if we were
drinking and having a good male time together. only to open the door and see
her completely naked ,right in front of my bedroom with me and my male
companion looking in utter shock. she didn't expect another male in the house
since i was the lonely tenant. i realised this girl is a weirdo and i began
locking my doors, would sleep at one of my hookup friends or mates or just
anyone else's house at night on weekends because she would come to visit me,
changed my number, everything.  
  
one fine day, she dropped in with her cousins and began shouting at me at my
house by collecting everyone, and my father visited me all the way from surat
, gujarat that morning, she kept saying everyone that i tricked her and had
sex under the context of relationship and showed screenshots of me on my
whatsapp messenger videos, what's even more surprising is that she took
pictures of me while i was in shower oneday in the naked, she showed our
lengthy conversations at night etc. she found my new number from someone in my
office by visiting and stalking me and sent me threatening messages of
alleging molestation and rape charges against her.  
  
i was so shocked and almost about to cry that i was being a friend to her as
she was in a horrible marriage and having divorce with her now husband
already, and that he used to beat her up and all that.  
  
i decided that's it's enough and i made my mind that i won't take this
atrocious behaviour towards me since my elder brother was himself a victim of
""false rape charges"" against him , i collected the entire world including my
relatives my office mates, my friends all over the digital world, the society
members, and guess what ? **i came out as a gay man because i had no choice**  
  
i opened up about my sexuality and everything to everyone including my parents
, my brothers, my boss, my teachers , everyone !  
i was not going to take this woman's shit anymore.  
  
i showed all my sex chats to the world with all the men i had it with, called
all the guys whom i hooked up with, showed all my pictures of me being gay
ever since i realised my sexuality at age 14 and the bullying i suffered as a
child. i didn't stop there ! i called up my ex and asked him to show the
videos were we kissed, had cosy consented adult time together, showed proofs
of gay bar visits in us , finland, israel and all places that i visited.  
  
and asked her if she wanted to really marry me if i keep having sex with men
and be her husband at the same time, she was even more shocked than she could
ever even dream of !  
  
gay men (90% of the time) are masculine and you would never even know that
they're gay until they say it themselves. most indian gay men by age 35 ,
almost 99% marry women to hide their sexuality. i'm of the remainder 1% who
are proud of themselves.  
  
found out this woman had a child already 5 years younger to me , already.  
  
lesson learnt :  
never even befriend a girl or be her companion in her bad times, you might end
up being called a rapist. lol, i can't even imagine seeing a woman nude , let
alone touching her , i literally keep a hand on the part in the porn where
naked girls are around hot naked men to avoid any visual encounter.  
  
my heart beats out for all my heterosexual brothers who have faced such female
molestation or rape charges, even worse if they ever consensual sex , because
the man is screwed now for life ! i saved myself because i was gay , ya'll
have no hopes !  
i also feel bad for girls who have been victims of rape by men, i won't be
biased at all. women do face more of sexual assaults than us men do, no point
in denial but there are many a times , men are victims of it themselves.  
  
imagine. showing your relatives, your sex videos with other people to prove
your sexuality just **so that nobody calls me a rapist**  
i knew those charges would be useless but once an allegation always is a
charge especially if it's a male. ""woh dekho wo launde ko, shadi shuda aurat
ka rape kiya usne""  
nobody would believe me even if i were to be free from all that legally. took
quick action, saved my family from all that shame .  
  
i'm not ashamed of being a gay man, because i made my life out being called a
chakka, hijda, what not by my own brothers, nobody accepted me not even my
straight bestfriend as i grew up because i trusted them and they ditched me ,
as a result i began engulfing my own self either by suffering it or having sex
with other men who would comfort me or play with me for some days in my
teenage years and support me emotionally and cry lonely in the showers and
beat myself ,cursing being a unlucky shame to the family. while my brothers
who did nothing significant didn't have to prove themselves just because
they're straight.  
  
many of my relatives distanced me since we are a conservative family what
matters is my own family, took no shame of me. my employers know my hardwork,
my friends know my value, my neighbours know my support.  
found immense respect socially. actually ,even more after coming out.  
  
my prayers with all rape victims of whatever gender, even more with the gay
men because nobody even reports it if it has been done out of society. most of
teenage gay men are sexually assaulted by their own heterosexual cousins or
had some encounter. you have no idea the trauma gay men suffer as children
being excluded from the world. drying within, most marry women by adulthood
just so that their parents have their dreams fulfilled , drinking their own
self sacrifice of being at freewill as venom. don't blame them, blame each and
every indian citizen for that.  
imagine being a victim , where court deemed us as criminals, religions
admonished us, families throwing us out, brothers beating us, our mothers love
us but they have no choice .  
  
god bless you if you've read this far. i'm just like your brother, son, begin
accepting us for who we are , this will save a lot of devastation from your
own human fellow being.",1
5996,5997,"just amazing. best regards to the director and his team.  
yes some girls are falsely accusing and misusing their power by asking about
equality. we are equal from the beginning itself. a female don't really knew
what feminism is but misuse her power by using it. in some places metros are
free for girls, there are girl's night in pub. but why? can't we pay the bills
or we are so weak? a female is making a female weak by pointing out the words
like ""freedom"" and ""equality"". recently what happened in noida? if that
happened to a girl, people would have come out and start protesting for
freedom and justice. but those were boys so no one came further for their
justice.  
what i'm saying is gender equality.  
we are already equal, if such things goes on and on there will be an another
movement, which will be named as ""mascularism"" and of course india will be the
first to start such kind of movement.  
everyone is equal and should be. if something is doing wrong, he or she should
be punished equally. everyone have their own voice and power. misusing these
powers will not help anyway or the other. rather it will ruined someone else's
life.",1

crime done against men and women , women stands in majority. i am surprised

rape is a heinous crime & should be dealt with utmost care and respect for

not. this is the reason why rapes are increasing though there are strict laws
against it in the country.

about showing a character like arjun reddy, but about the subtext behind the
story. the subtext tries to make a “hero” without identifying the abuse he is
doing. let’s look at an example here. sardar khan in gangs of wasseypur forces
himself on nagma, and nagma falls in love too with him. same foreground, but
let’s look at the subtext. sardar khan has been portrayed as this dark twisted
character by the director. he’s still a likable character but the director
never shies away from discussing his dark behavior as it is. the subtext is
aware of his wrong doings and that’s why it’s okay. now, no one is asking
filmmakers to be overt feminists like kashyap is. i mean nagma does use sardar
for sex, and does start a family with him, for her character has been shown to
be attracted to this abusive guy in the society filled with similar folks. she
decides to marry him and get some leverage in the society. it’s her decision
that the audience can study. rather, kashyap later goes in develop her as this
badass woman who gets sardar killed when she gets wronged. a sudden
development of a strong female character without breaking realism. arjun reddy
is distasteful in 2017-19 era. films like these were a norm till the last
decade. it’s just sad to see people gravitating towards such regressive
thoughts. this conversation also takes me back to javed akhtar’s fantastic
argument breaker. he says don’t get into why the film is bad. but ask people,
if there was no abuse in his actions against women as such, then what was it
that made millions of men get titilated by it. javed used this argument for
pragya thakur’s nomination. he said people are saying pragya doesn’t have
those cases proven against her. to that javed said you ask those people, if
she didn’t do those things, then why is liked. it’s because you think she did
that against the muslims she is famous. or else why is she a hit. a kind of a
twisted analogy, but try to understand it. arjun reddy type films should have
become obsolete, but ....well.",1

not. as for toxic masculinity - 1. shahid has made a very bad choice & suffers
endlessly till he gives up in the extreme end & makes a change.
transformational characters have a way of connecting with audiences, come what
may. 2. let’s look at patriarchy narrative - all love stories true or untrue
have that. there’s also reverse discrimination against men in society at times
- biggest example all supposed criminals guilty of crime yet to be proved are
published with photos n names if you are a male. go look for traffic challans
- less than 5% number is female - ain’t that surprising ? all power to women -
watch bhavani bhavai, mirch masala, rudaali n many more. 3. let’s look at
patriarchy & other stupid evils as in movies - all karva chauth scenes ever,
lavish weddings n songs, success at any cost, all super fit heroes & heroines,
the list is endless. these are subliminal & vicious more damaging than
anything. 4. flawed characters are just that - characters in a story arc. we
have flawed protagonists in darr, baazigar, anjaam, devdas, dev d, raging
bull, taxi driver, wolf of wall street, a clockwork orange, so many more. it’s
just a movie. 5. do haunted houses shown means we never buy them or that
ghosts exist ? there’s free will & free choice. 6. what’s bigger cheating -
saying that you are catering to family & make movies like race3, thugs of
hindustan, zero, kalank, tubelight & cheat audience of non engaging bullshit.
or dada kondke, mithun movies which know their audience - engaged or
entertained them, though not to everyone’ s taste. but they were not cheating
their audience. 7. an actor becomes a muslim to marry 2nd time, so many actors
have extramarital affairs, so many actresses break homes & marry a married
person. nepotism, corruption is always okay when it’s personal but not in
public domain. should we be boycotting all these to set an example ? 8. i felt
disappointed when laila majnu, sonchidiya flopped & bodyguard, raja hindustani
etc. made money. in terms of technicalities & acting skills kabir singh is
good, trying a narrative which is engaging at times & cringy at others. this
will work overall for sure. why look for political correctness all the time ?

6118,6119,"​@elva136 see, it is just my personal opinion , but it would be better if you
do not use the over-used words such as 'feminist', 'male entitlement', and
'toxic' when you argue against this movie(or the mentality that has become
this movie).  
  
  
the reason is that there is so much of bullshit that is attached with the
definition of these words, most of it coming from the privileged but dumb
american left and most of the issues that are raised using those words are
concerning only the educated financially independent upper middle class white
women. in india, where there are communities and citizens that have only
slowly started to understand that women are also human beings and not just
properties, we are eons and eons behind the west in the basic understanding of
human rights. so when you appropriate such academic words to the indian
context, there would be a huge distortion in the message you want to convey,
not to mention the meaning lost due to cultural differences. where in the west
their first world issue is to have the right to be topless in public, in india
the public have yet to acknowledge the basic right of a woman to choose what
she wants to wear.  
  
  
furthermore, these words have been parrotted within and without context so
often, that it could mean just about anything but basic right of a woman for
respect, dignity and freedom in the society, especially in a country like
india, where there are women that belong to a wide variety of economic
classes, not to mention segregations based on caste.  
  
  
what i have also observed is that the conservatives of india have also started
to appropriate the words and arguments of the western conservatives, like
'libtards', to nullify such criticisms as against kabir singh. which they
would do easily, because what they are basically nullifying is the dumb
arguments of american left appropriated by the indian liberals. the american
left liberals are nowhere near as rational or educated as indian liberals,
leftists and centrists, while the american conservatives are far more
progressive when compared to the indian conservatives( who are just a bunch of
undemocratic dumb savages).  
  
  
instead of directly using those words in the arguments, arguing using the
rationale behind those words, while keeping in mind the reality of how deep
such discriminations are etched in the fabric of our indian society, would do
more more good, i guess. not for the sake of winning the argument, nor in the
hope that these dumb idiots would understand it somehow. but for the rational
people who still has a flicker of humanity in them, to read such arguments and
spread the message.",1

clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are
without excuse.

thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were
darkened. 22 although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and
exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like a mortal
human being and birds and animals and reptiles.  
  
24 therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to
sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 they
exchanged the truth about god for a lie, and worshiped and served created
things rather than the creator—who is forever praised. amen.

themselves the due penalty for their error. furthermore, just as they did not
think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god, so god gave them over to a
depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. although they know

6152,6153,"@jin #4289369 no one is born gay. if you'll look into it deeply you'll know
its a satanic agenda promoted by elite satanists in hollywood,the music
industry etc.. i've heard it from actors and singers themselves. being a
supporter of gay rights opens the gates to accepting of worse sins like
acceptance of satanism. us gay laws were passed in 2015, one year or 2 years
later, satanism is made an official religion in us and they've built a statue
of the baphomet right in front of the 10 commandments. also it's really funny
how we are called bigots when in reality, you people support public nudity in
gay parades, and how you can support legal pedophilia (kid drag queen, desmond
is amazing, danced in a bar with dollar bills thrown on him by nude and semi
nude gay men) also we are called bigots when preachers are assaulted by gay
people on a regular basis. seriously, gay pride parades are nothing more than
public pornography. for those telling me to stop hating, first answer the
above questions. also its illegal to mispronounce your gender,or to get into a
debate with gay people,yet its perfectly legal to mock our lord jesus. several
gay celebs and gay people have mocked jesus on national tv,yet that's not
called hate. also christians don't hate gay people, but rather the sin of
homosexuality. no one is born gay,its a demonic perversion. i've talked online
and debated with members of the lgbtq community,none of them are able to
answer my question. also i've had several encounters where those people show
sick pornographic lgbt images(some loving community huh) just for engaging in
a debate. i've heard testimonies of people who used to be part of the lgbt
community, actually calling it a horrible sin. the theme of lgbt is pride, but
mainstream media which is controlled by satanic elites in hollywood and the
music industry have made us forget about god. ever wondered why so many
homosexual pedophilia takes place in hollywood? its because high ranked
directors and celebs have sold their souls, and pedophilia,rape, molestation
are ways of indoctrination into the higher levels of this society. lgbt is an
agenda supported by satanists,whom you think are atheists. its a prophecy in
biblical texts. even pope leo xiii had visions of what's to come for this
world. he saw satan telling god that he's going to control and influence the
world in the 20th century,in those visions,satan showed leo xiii visions of
war, abortion, demonic possessions, and yes homosexuality! and this vision
happened over 130 years ago,and its true. the 20th century had more deaths in
wars than all the other centuries combined,sibs became virtues, pornography
becomes so popular almost all people have seen it one way or another,
abortions have taken place in such a way that the number of dead fetuses could
fill an ocean, homosexuality becomes supported even more than christianity.
the world we live in is made to believe that god and satan doesn't exist, but
its a high level agenda done by the freemasons, kaballists,shriners, and
illumunati. they control mainstream media,they are in nasa, cia, fbi and any
government places. if you've read till here, i humbly ask you to first answer
my questions before ignorantly calling me an idiot or bigot or anything of
that sort. else, i'll consider you as a foolish ignorant nutbag who is simply
stupid",1

are human and innocent. why you hate and reject them, this is criminal. if god
really hates and against homosexuality he would not create gay people on this

homosexuality, then you just do it. gay people never dislike you, so why you

6167,6168,"i am a 27 year old gay man from a small town in up. i am out to my family and
a lot of other people in my life, so it would be easier for me to participate
in the gay pride parades, but the problem is these pride parades happen in big
cities mostly and no where near me. however, lucknow started its pride march
in 2016 and lucknow is near me, so may join lucknow pride in future(didn't see
any youtube video of 2017 pride march in lucknow which i had hoped to attend).
anyways, since i also wanted to contribute to the upliftment of my gay
community i did the following:  
1\. i collected around 1400 mobile numbers of around 850 members of parliament
(the contact details are available on lok sabha and rajya sabha website). and
i wrote the following sms on these numbers:  
""sir/maam, i am a 26 year old homosexual person from u.p. homosexual people
have the same aspirations in life as heterosexual people. kindly change
section 377.""  
i received several call backs but i was too afraid to talk with an mp. though
i chatted with some of them via sms.  
2\. then, i sent all the mps a very elaborate whatsapp message in pure hindi
basically saying gays are the new dalits and homophobia is the new
untouchability. i wish i had saved that message to show you guys. i basically
made humble demand for acknowledgement, education about and protection of
gays.  
this time i received even more encouraging responses. so far so that one of
the mps asked me to visit him in his delhi office. though i excused myself out
of it because i was at lucknow, with a relative and broke. but above all,
again, too intimated to face an mp when i am a nobody and have nobody.
anyways, a lot of those mps still send me messages on festivals, etc.  
3\. i also emailed every mp on their official email id, with the concerns of
gay indians. and again received several positive responses. one interesting
thing that happened is the personal assistant of one of the mps who must have
read my mail called me and said that he has a gay family member and was asking
me how to deal with it basically.  
  
now why i am telling these things to you guys is because i believe we as a
community, the gay community need to up our game and be more focused. pride
marches are great but i am sure it doesn't reach our legislature, judiciary or
executive. so it's my request to reach out to our elected representatives in
the parliament and the supreme court judges with smses, whatsapp messages,
letters and whatnot. and also if you are a small town gay or lesbian, don't be
afraid that your family will not understand when you come out to them. i am
from ghazipur, a small town near varanasi and have a big joint family and have
told almost everyone in my family and they all understand. we have to give
them more credit. i came out to some verbally, to some through letters and to
some through whatsapp message. i also have visited several doctors in small
towns and have told them that i am gay and they all are aware and educated and
ready to help.  
  
i hope my this rather long message helps someone in someway. (feel free to ask
me how to collate 1400 mobile numbers in your phone, send messages in bulk
etc. i have done them all and will be doing them in future also)",1

a-sexually but chance of pregnancy increases when it is with another female.
other then that only less than .6% of humans are gay",1
6171,6172,"i knew it !! i knew that you were gonna ask me that as your next question.
see. i clearly told you that the examples that i gave dont prove anything. so
i did not imply that choosing or not choosing are related to normal or natural
behaviour. its just that the statistics speak something. no one really knows
what it is, all the way down to the fundamentals of sexuality. and by the way,
bestiality may be just normal or natural. or it maybe just disgusting. but who
knows ? maybe bestiality is just another form of sexual orientation ! buuuut.
why should people be against it then ?? simple. because even though a person
may wanna have sex with an animal, there is no way of knowing whether the
animal also wants to have sex with the person. i told you in that previous
comment that consensual relationships are nobody's business. animals cant give
consent, coz neither can we understand them nor can they understand us. you
can end up raping the animal. so that closes the chapter on bestiality and it
must be forbidden. next question that you may wanna ask is: pedophilia ! so,
again, pedophilia may just be another form of sexual orientation. who knows ?
buuut again ! a child is not really capable of giving consent, isnt it ?
that's why we have laws in most countries about the age of consent. some
places its 16 some 18 blah blah blah. but its not 12 years old anywhere, i
guess. coz most kids are just too immature at that age, even though different
kids start maturing at different ages. no one actually knows what the right
age is. maybe we'll never know. but its reasonable to assume that kids are
mature by the time they are like 15 or 16 so that is the widely accepted age
range of consent in many countries. but it is always dangerous for a pedophile
to assume that a kid that he wants to have sex with can give him/her consent,
bcoz you dont really know if the child is old enough to think about it. thats
why sex with children should also be forbidden, well until they reach the age
of maturity, as i have been saying all along. so if an adult wants to have sex
with an animal or a child, but never acts upon his/her desires, well then that
is fine and he/she should not be criminalized in society. there is a
difference between a pedophile and a child molester. but anyway, you get my
point, i hope. now i know the next question you are probably gonna ask, but
ill wait for your reply to see if thats what it is. lol",1
6172,6173,"homosexuality is a disorder, created by a warped cognition.  
  
humans evolved with specific emotions and organs with a goal in mind. for
instance, males developed penises for reproduction. how does nature encourage
one to reproduce? sexual attraction. how does nature encourage one to
reproduce again after already done so? sexual pleasure that releases dopamine
that happens after release of sperm or female orgasm.  
  
other forms of love exist just to develop social bonds which creates a herd
group since humans are social animals. males and females were not meant to
have sex with the same sex. friendship? yes. sex in the butt or fingering? no.  
  
homosexuals that still have vaginas and penises are going against their
natural evolution and experience feelings that are abnormal in how nature
intended. biology isn't perfect (yes, psychology is biology with behaviorism).  
  
it's a disorder through and through. doesnt matter if it hurts the individual
or not. a disorder is whenever your emotions are out of balance or do not
serve their purpose.",1

transformational characters have a way of connecting with audiences, come what
may. 2. let’s look at patriarchy narrative - all love stories true or untrue
have that. there’s also reverse discrimination against men in society at times
- biggest example all supposed criminals guilty of crime yet to be proved are
published with photos n names if you are a male. go look for traffic challans
- less than 5% number is female - ain’t that surprising ? all power to women -
watch bhavani bhavai, mirch masala, rudaali n many more. 3. let’s look at
patriarchy & other stupid evils as in movies - all karva chauth scenes ever,
lavish weddings n songs, success at any cost, all super fit heroes & heroines,
the list is endless. these are subliminal & vicious more damaging than
anything. 4. flawed characters are just that - characters in a story arc. we
have flawed protagonists in darr, baazigar, anjaam, devdas, dev d, raging
bull, taxi driver, wolf of wall street, a clockwork orange, so many more. it’s
just a movie. 5. do haunted houses shown means we never buy them or that
ghosts exist ? there’s free will & free choice. 6. what’s bigger cheating -
saying that you are catering to family & make movies like race3, thugs of
hindustan, zero, kalank, tubelight & cheat audience of non engaging bullshit.
or dada kondke, mithun movies which know their audience - engaged or
entertained them, though not to everyone’ s taste. but they were not cheating
their audience. 7. an actor becomes a muslim to marry 2nd time, so many actors
have extramarital affairs, so many actresses break homes & marry a married
person. nepotism, corruption is always ok when it’s personal but not in public
domain. should we be boycotting all these to set an example ? 8. i felt

being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in
karan's good book list. by attracting kangana is the fastest way to get a job
from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure
hearted. so, taapsee use that tool intentionally. that is her strategy or plan
to get role from them.  
  
  
  
honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments
deals, but they never put outsider heroine on the top cuz that position only
belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia
play games with outsiders.

6184,6185,"indian film critics mainly the female critics are bashing it because of
arjun/kabir's nature of being extra possessive, bully etc. and also blaming
our cultural set up where audiences are not at all thinking about the attitude
of the lead character and are just clapping. it's really disturbing",1
6185,6186,"hinduism is not against homosexuality but many hindus are...sad how they are
influenced more by the culture of the people who invaded and looted it more
than their own culture and religion..😔😔",1
6186,6187,"homosexuality : is it natural ?[困]  
  
not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .  
  
the question that should be asked is,  
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?  
  
cause when god created this universe & everything in this universe to obey him
& his law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
the planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .  
  
i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. they all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.  
  
the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30
minutes ,the planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.  
  
man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.  
  
now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?  
  
it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of god & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, his whole life style will be a deviation.  
  
the bible clearly says ,he changed the ""truth"" of god into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of god & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in africa walking
around with broken wrists .  
  
since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.  
  
scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,we have seen that ""thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.  
  
so scripture says "" behold i the sovereign lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.  
  
there is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, god is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created.",1
6187,6188,"@mahnoor m it is simple that if we allow them more mad people will start
copying homosexual and one day we will find that our children is also
homosexual and whole country is homosexual.",1
6188,6189,"first of all i would like to point that homosexuality is not a crime, you
humans invented it and it is neither an illness or diseases. if it was an
illness that person would be totally sick and no brain so how can you explain
that there are doctors or lawyer or pilots gay. all people not agreed with
this facts because they think they are normal, so please hetero just live your
life and don't bother or interfere in gay people private life, it's not your
problem at all. if tomorrow you will have a gay child, what will you do ??
will you love him or kill him ??? if you are from old school we can't do
anything as we are living in new school now. the first groups who always put
mess in it are religious group or old minded people. how been religious people
are you so cruel and discriminate god's child. this is action is crime, not
being homosexual. being terrorists and dislike or disrespect people are more
criminal act than being gay. why you islam don't accept that, you only making
mess all around the world about this matter. don't you have lots of muslim
brothers who are gay around this world ?? why you hate and reject them, this
is criminal. if god against homosexuality he would not create gay people, it
is you only don't like it. gay people never dislike you, and you turned
aggressive against this community. you live your live what you think is
correct and let the lgbt community also live their own life please.  
please change your mentality we are living in a new world.",1

homosexual will get what they want but kids who are sexually confused who are
not born gay will think it's ok. look at america. an 3th grader saying she
thinks she is lesbian because when she sees male she thinks she is not
attracted. believe me if you watch gays on tv and society it'll get disturbed.
a fine line has to be drawn. it all starts with a small thing and it has too
many consequences. the people who are born gay i'm not against them.. just
look at them anyone can tell they are born gay they didn't have a choice.",1

and bisexuality ? india has fallen so low since the influence of abrahamic
cults - christianity & islam which have only spread hatred against
homosexuals.",1

homosexuality is normal....sanatan dharma is about spirituality hence it
dosen't matter if u are straight gay lesbian bisexual transgender theist
atheist etc....everyone is accepted in one way or the other .....also for the
theists sanatan dharma have all forms of gods may it be
male,female,transgender,formless ,homosexual,animal like,rivers,trees

peace/spirituality/salvation only and only by him/her self not by any other
means......",1

6194,6195,"there is description about homosexuals and other third genders in the hindu
scriptures, they had specific roles to play in ancient hindu society, none of
them were treated badly. the sexual inclination comes to human being from past
sanskars, and we all possess all kinds of sanskars, in most of the people
homosexual remain hidden while heterosexul sanskars predominate over one's
personality....difference is that only first two genders usually participate
in the procreation,",1
6195,6196,"aids is not exclusive to homosexuals. if it is as big a problem as you claim,
then proper response would be to promote safe sex practices and using condoms.
and transsexuals have absolutely nothing to do with aids who the hell told you
all that?",1
6196,6197,"what is moral is not decided by the majority but by reason, just as finding
out objective truths. (most people thought earth was flat then, that didn't
make it true) and what does the evidence say? homosexuality is a normal part
of the animal kingdom and has been observed in over 1500 species. (wiki:
homosexuality in animals) there is no evidence that it is a choice. when did
you choose to be heterosexual? (assuming you are) you can certainly choose to
hide it or say the truth, but not being gay",1
6197,6198,"there is evidence for heterosexuality. there must be for homosexuality too.. i
am not saying that it is wrong. i am saying that it is a choice and hence
people who attack heterosexuals for saying it's not natural is not
right,because what is natural is defined by what the majority feel is natural
and what results in an outcome which is necessary for the existence of the
human species.both are necessary/",1
6198,6199,"quote me any scientific journal that says its a choice there is no evidence of
anybody choosing their sexuality. gays didn't choose to be gay any more than
you chose to be straight",1
6199,6200,"tbh i don't agree with homosexuality. in fact i find the whole sexual
intercourse between 2 men as disturbing. but that does not mean i would
victimise or be cruel to a gay person! never! that's not in my nature. but to
me, i think sexual behaviours, wether its prostitution, transsexuals and gays
are a problem for society and will soon realise why when aids is one of the
rapid spreading diseases in the world!",1
6200,6201,"dude you cant blame transsexuals they are born with organs that are not
completely of either gender that is not their fault but homosexuality is
definitely a result of life experiences and the effect of media.",1
6201,6202,"my two cents, if the world wants to be gay let it be gay. its not my sin
neither is it my place to stop it. homosexuality amongst so meany other issues
is a world issue...let it judge its own. even the same, when the issue comes
into the church, dont be suprised that its forbidden (or at least should be).i
have refused to marry homosexuals and always will, but im not going to protest
it either",1

while other three are against the lgbt community. the balt guy is saying every
person has the right to live is life on their own choice so lgbt community has
also right to live their life according to their choice while at 377 saying
that it is illegal and they will be punished by indian judiciary. the other
three guys are saying that act 377 is legal women sexual person or lgbt
community has no right to choose their partner to live their life according to
their choice. if the indian judiciary allow then too select their partner or
their life as their own conditions that will be harmful for their religious
practices sociality and for the future of india. so a person should be
punished by indian penal code if if he or she fine to involve in any kind of
homeo sexual activity also they are saying that women sexual and lgbt
community is majorly responsible for sexual disease such as its rti and sti.

..only abrahmic faiths judaism christianity and islam opposes homosexuality

opinion its not unnatural",1

A California prosecutor is dropping all charges against a doctor and his girlfriend, alleging that his predecessor manufactured allegations that the couple drugged and sexually assaulted up to 1,000 women.

The stunning turn of events comes a year and a half after the case against [Grant Robicheaux](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-grant-robicheaux-orange-countys-most-eligible-bachelor-accused-of-drugging-raping-women), an orthopedic surgeon who appeared on the TV show *The Online Dating Rituals of the American Male,* and substitute teacher [Cerissa Riley](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cerissa-riley-arrested-for-rapes-with-dr-grant-robicheaux-was-an-evangelical-missionary) exploded into the headlines.

At the time, Orange Countys then-district attorney, Tony Rackauckas, claimed the pair lured women to their Newport Beach home, knocked them unconscious, and raped them.

At a press conference in September 2018, he said investigators had seized hundreds of incriminating videos from the couples phones. Asked whether the number could be as a high as a thousand, Rackauckas said, I think so.

A few months later, though, Rackauckas was out of office, replaced by current DA Todd Spitzer, who eventually ordered a review of the evidence. He says he was appalled by what he found.

**The prior District Attorney and his chief of staff manufactured this case and repeatedly misstated the evidence to lead the public and vulnerable women to believe that these two individuals plied up to 1,000 women with drugs and alcohol in order to sexually assault themand videotape the assaults, Spitzer said in a blistering statement.**

As a result of the complete case review I ordered beginning in July, **we now know that there was not a single video or photograph depicting an unconscious or incapacitated woman being sexually assaulted.**

Rackauckas has not responded to his former rivals allegations. But Robicheauxs attorney praised the reversal...""

So the next time you hear how Bill Cosby must be guilty, just look at all of his accusers, think real hard about it.  If a DA could literally find 1000 accusers out of thin air that a new DA has determined to all be fake, every single one, all of a suddenly it becomes much more plausible that a congo line of fake accusers be rolled out against any man.  Come on, if there was really all that much rape out there, do you think the DAs would have to be inventing ones that don't exist?",0

Had a friend of mine who dated this one girl. She once, without asking, unzipped his pants and blew him. He asked her to stop; she kept going. He breaks up with her sometime later and she gets upset and falsely accuses him of rape. (This was while we were in our senior year of high school). Everyone took the girls side and people were making death threats on a regular basis. One of his exswho was notorious for being feminist to the point that the word was almost synonymous with her namealso came forward with a false rape accusation. Even more people got pissed off and took up the MeToo ideology. Police had to escort my friend wherever he went bc he actually got jumped a few times 

Fortunately, no legal action was taken against him. Eventually it all blew over but several still thought my friend was in the wrong after it since they never listened to the truth.

The trust in dietary pseudoscience at the time seemed very out of place with someone who is so well versed in history, well read and readily quotes primary literature research from his own field.

I *wish* that my *only* problem with ugliness was the lack of success with women. I found many copes like vidya, movies, and dog to cope with loneliness. It's painful to be alone but it's possible to go on. 

But bullying absolutely destroys my mentality and will to live. It happens almost weekly. I've developed social anxiety, and depression. I cannot go outside feeling safe. I have missed all my lectures in the past 3 months and when I did go outside, I was met with more bullying. I cannot do my favorite sport, I can't even go shopping because I will be met with smirks and looks of disgust. This is the life of ugly man. 

*Who are the bullies?* It's mostly women - educated medical students that will soon become doctors. *What do they say?* Mostly ""eew"", ""hell no"", ""he is ugly""....

For instance, last Wednesday we had an exam. I was standing in line with earphones when I hear an ""eew"" and then 4 girls in front turned around and looked at my face with spite. How am I supposed to be confident? How can I become a doctor when I cannot look in people's eyes from bullying? FML.

Paranoia can kick in pretty well. You feel like everyone is looking at you and judging, making fun or being disgusted. But in reality it could be not that vivid.

Why is an actress glaring at me? Is she one of the three Birds of Prey actresses that no one knows the names of or cares about?",0
346,347,"So here is the thing.

The power of women are closely related to their ability to manipulate men.

A woman of high marriage value has social status and is given attention by men, who want to make her happy.

This marriage value peaks in her mid twenties. Her social status peaks even earlier.

As she gets older her manage value and social status comes less from her potential to make a good partner and more from her accomplishments, one of which should be becoming part of a successful family unit. Having a successful husband and children should add to her status. By 40 her oldest child could be 20.

Feminists seek to have power independent of their potential as a partner and of their attractiveness.

They want women to occupy a privileged social position *because they are women*! They want to retain that power for longer, at the expense of younger, more attractive women.

This is an effort to mitigate the consequences of life choices and to gain power independent of the men in their family. Of course they want media with frumpy, powerful women.

Intro

Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. 

Body

>Good seduction competently follows Mysterys attraction, comfort, escalation model and so lay reports tend to get repetitious. Im much more interested in the principles of game that you can use repeatedly to get ongoing results than any one particular story.

>Knowing the underlying principles means you can get repeat results. Recently I pulled together a threesome with my main girl and a new one I met, and taking RPDs excellent advice I wanted to write this lay report to crystallize for myself what I did right while my thoughts are fresh. I intend to do more of these in the future.

There are a number of takeaways

>Set the frame from the first time you meet a girl that youre a sexual, non-judgmental guy. Plant the seed with women you date as part of your sexual dirty talk that a threesome would be fun for you and her to enjoy together.

>When pitching the actual threesome date to a girl you dont know well, be indirect. Instead just suggest another friend joins for a drink or that you hang out at your place. Give girls plausible deniability.

>Threesomes take even stronger leading than a normal 1:1 date. You as the man have to lead the girls through the entire process.

Conclusion

Threesomes are fun but tricky. 

How this benefits the community

Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. If you are a guy and you want a threesome, then this is a guide to help you make that happen. Most guys have no idea how to make this happen so it's nice to see someone who does. 

TL;DR.

Threesomes are fun but tricky and this includes a bunch of information about how to make them happen.",1
358,359,i stopped reading once he said his main girl wasnt into other girls....  only way a 3sum really works is if both girls are bi.,0
359,360,"Then maybe you should read the article, retard",0
360,361,"Good points in here but I gotta cringe at 
>I could tell she was getting turned on by seeing me expertly seduce another attractive girl in front of her.

The whole thing is about sex, does the writing have to be masturbatory? Hard to take the points seriously when he sounds like a comical macho version of himself.",0
361,362,Seems like a common theme with people posting here.,0
362,363,"I wouldn't say I'm versed enough to make that call, but I have seen it before.

I, personally, have a harder time taking these seriously when they're written like this. It's like the focus shifts from helping others and sharing knowledge and experience, to some sort of ego gratifying boast. Really pulls me out of it.",0
363,364,"His main girl getting turned on is of extreme importance to the success of the threesome, and is therefore highly worth documenting to himself, which is why he wrote the blog in the first place, by his own account. If you had ever navigated a threesome yourself, you would likely understand this, so I'll assume you haven't and explain in a bit further detail.  

Whether they discussed it beforehand or not (he hints they did), his main girl has veto power (he likes the girl and clearly doesn't want to lose his primary relationship over a random internet stranger); main girl can shut this down at any time whether he likes it or not. Therefore, her happiness, attraction and desire - that is, her being turned on - are the highest priority of making this threesome a reality. Keep cringing at descriptions of expert seduction. More threesomes for me.",1
364,365,"Ironically, forming a caricature of himself shows insecurity, which to me is the opposite of true masculinity.

Have all the threesomes you want, but writing, boasting and acting in that way is inauthentic and childish.",0
365,366,"Since no-one uplifts us, let's uplift ourselvesI uplift myself through self care. I take special care of my hair and I try different styling techniques, I try not to skip my skin care and I apply a mask on my face once a week (I feel very feminine , like those images of women with masks on their faces and slices of cucumber on their eyes  lol), I do my nails twice a month,  I remind myself to wear accessories because I feel so much better when I wear a pair of earrings or a necklace.

 My favourite part of my  own interpretation of self care and uplifting myself, are my me-parties. Usually on Friday night, since I don't go out, I have the best time with myself! I throw my own fashion show, where I try on clothes I don't usually wear  or I experiment with my clothes to create different styles, I do my make up, I dance by myself and I sometimes do karaoke. I also wear my high heels which I rarely wear outside! It's not like I am able to forget how undesirable and lonely I am, but at least I am able to have fun by myself!",0
366,367,youre such a wholesome person ,0
367,368,"That's cute. :3 I try to uplift myself by cooking home-made dinners or treating myself to pancakes outside. I too wear peeling masks every once and then, prolly not often enough.",0
368,369,"Oh yes! I love cooking! I also want to try going out to eat alone! I am not that comfortable in public yet, but I'm getting there!",0
369,370,my valentine's day present to myself will be getting my eyeliner tattooed :),0
370,371,I love the idea of gifting yourself on Valentine's!,0
371,372,lol i was planning on getting it done anyway :) the booking on the 14 was a lucky coincidence :),0
372,373,Haha but now you gave me a great idea! I'm buying myself some piece of jewellery or a dress as a Valentine's gift!,0
373,374,go treat yourself! :) now's a great time to buy jewellery cos of all the promotions anyway,0
374,375,in terms of self care i guess i want to go to psychotherapy or get on meds and finally get my mental health under control. i've been like a dead man walking for 8 years now and i either get healthy or die.,0
375,376,I love this post. I love you. Cheers to self-care <3,0

I'm glad that she admitted to it, because it would have been close to impossible to prove without professional police investigation as they see and deal with these types of messes on a regular basis. There are patterns that they can pick up on better than we can because they have no emotional investment in the case.

Now it's time to process, heal and forgive. You don't need to be incredibly close, but be civil to your sister. Your parents will come around as well. Time will erode the stress. Stay away for a while.

I was on the path to something similar, but gave my wife the heads up and asked her to watch for the signs. She did, and noticed the same. I keep my distance, and they meet up at my in-laws now. Nothing has been said openly, but at least there's awareness.",0
388,389,"More often than not truth isn't coming out or does way too late. This guy already got social repercussions for something he didn't. The same way Johny Depp was.

389,390,"Yep. Sometimes l, like you said, after judgement has already been made. There is an effect and I can't remember the term, but it has something to do with presenting your version of a story first to the masses even though it's untrue and just continue to hammer it in. Then the truth comes out, and although acknowledged, the masses still flock to the first version. Hope I laid this out correctly.",0

After hearing a million of these stories, I'm convinced that college-age women actually believe they've been raped, in situations where it's clearly not the case.  Brett Solokow, a lawyer representing women in college rape tribunals, has made similar observations.  It's basically delusional hysteria.  

>AVFM: How common do you think it is that those who falsely accuse are punished for their crime/misconduct?

This is almost certainly biological, and possibly related to the fact that humans are the only primates that do not go into heat.

Add alcohol and it becomes like a multiple personality disorder.  It's like the movie ""Fight Club"" for women.",1

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever.

414,415,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there.

415,416,"Great write up. It's great that you've Found a way to rebound from divorce. . That's an experience. I've never had. And don't envy anyone. . 

My question is in regard to your mention of having 40 year old friendships. I have really struggled to find. Men, that would make good friends. . I had a few guys that I'd known for more than 20 years, but Those relationships fall apart when the females they are involved with pressure them to break contact with friends and family in the predictable way. They are too blue pilled to make their own decisions in this regard. 

How do you suggest finding red pilled guys to bond with? Have you ever had to wait for the if and when of a former friend coming out of the blue pilled haze? Have you found a way to be friends with blue pilled guys despite the lack of common values and the obstacles females impose on them?

I have no trouble spending time by myself But it would be great to have the kind of friendships that I used to. I'm just not sure that is possible. The guys on this sub are the closest I have to real friends.",1
416,417,"In my case, my oldest friends are from
childhood, and the Army.

I would say, do what you love to do, and find brothers therein who have been red-pilled by life. In my case, I have married friends, and Red Pill friends. The Red Pill friends have lived the XX experience.

Shared activity is how we, as men, bond. Try Meetup. Or a Maker guild.
Or start something on your own.

Just remember- that feeling of isolation is DELIBERATE. Our society PREFERS you that way.

417,418,"People in general are just bad at relationships in general. No one is perfect and every relationship will have friction to work through. That said there are many people that you should figure out arent worth investing in, but plenty people are worth it. Dont give up because of experiences that burnt you, recover, set better boundaries now that youve learned something, get back out there and risk. Friendship is really simple, you just have to be intentional now as an adult where no-one is sitting you in a room with the same 30 people all year; like all things that are worth it, they are simple, but difficult, we are all just so lazy in the west with resources to distance ourselves. Be the initiator, every time Ive reached out to friendships that fell to the wayside because life just happens and derails things, or even if there was hurt, weve always appreciated it and everyone always says something like man why dont we do this more, Im so bad about keeping up with people etc... solo-entertainment is just so easily at our fingertips, put some energy into your life and get out there and engage, plan for some friends, give yourself to them. Also dont fret to much over blue piller friends unless they are an actual danger to yourself. I have some great blue pill friends who are slowly slowly turning red. Be the friend that is there when theyre run over by life for their blind spots, theyll really need a friend then, even better if that friend can give them some red pills. How do you have 40 year long friends? I imagine something like never giving up on that friendship. Its very unlikely you just stumble upon red pillers for friends, much more likely that you can make some, because the truth and better ideas always wins out.",0

And fortunately with the blue pill guys had known since childhood. There's a bit more complicated history there. They kind of blew up a really. Good Business Partnership. Because of things at home with their females and financial pressures. So if we ever do patch things up, it's going to need a lot more time than I've given it so far.",0

Two men fought a duel over her and she chose neither. She probably got to travel to places people didn't even get to see in pictures at the time. I won't romanticize though.

Story-driven games need to focus on the stories itself, and not being preachy. Games can't sacrifice what makes it fun for the sake of a narrative.

I'm tired of 'nazi bad, communist good' bull shit narratives, when communists killed far more people than nazis ever could or did even during the same time line and for worse reasons. How about a storyline where it shows how some one became a nazi or some shit, cause it's not out of fucking ignorant hate like people like. Something drives people to evil or wrong deeds where they see it as no other solution for an issue they have. Go over how WWI was a mixed bag of blame and who started it really is confusing to this day, but germany was given the shitload of blame for losing and despite multiple leaders saying it's a bad idea to blame them and punish them for WWI cause there'd just be another one after, left them a toothless, trodden, stepped on pile of turds by the rest of the world that they don't even blame them for. Imagine living in a country like this and seeing it constantly mock you. There's a snapping point where people don't care anymore after being picked on or stepped on for so long and so hard they'll turn to dark actions.

Show why the south has a weirdly french cultural influence and all the reasons why the civil war happened. Slavery and why the south didn't want that to end just there. One of the main thing is that the south had a lot of french refugees from Haiti 60 years prior to the civil war when the Haitian genocide happened, when there was a slave rebellion that killed the french settler army. Then soon after a second genocide where all french women and children included were targets, they went house to house with this.

Go over the basic concept of hate doesn't come from ignorance, it is a reaction to knowledge of things. It is not inherent, it is learned. Don't put some sort of dehumanizing lens of cartoonish evil nonsense on it constantly and understand why people turn to these horrid things. Basic fucking empathy to understand how to avoid it repeating. Every evil deed in history has been justified by the time it happened and the stakes it presented. Every evil deed reviewed by history is demonized or idolized by who ever controls the lesson plan for that day.

Oh, and stop two things in every fucking game in the past: Every 'minority' group getting along fine, and the weirdo progressive main protagonist that thinks the other group of criminals is worse than them cause they're racist/sexist what ever. Every civil rights group has historically HATED each other. Black-civil rights groups hated LGBT as did the feminists, feminists called black-civil rights groups N-word constantly and complained that they let (word) vote before them. Hell, it's LGBT today not because it was chosen like that, it was originally GLBT for how many there typically is going down with the letters, but to stop feminists from hating gay guys they changed it to LGBT. Hell, feminism's proudest thing in american, Planned Parenthood, started by a super racist eugenicists who wanted to open a bunch of them to abort black kids mostly, and looking at their typical locations, they're doing great in that regard for her plan.

The other weirdly progressive for his time protagonist thing. The worse thing you can do is kill some one. Because one dude is more selective/trigger happy when their target is a different shade doesn't magically make them better than the trigger happy ass hole who just kills cause reason. Being selective in who you murder doesn't make anyone worse for being a normal murderer.",0

721,722,"My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.

It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.

The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". 

Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. 

I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.

TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",1

When I approach a woman, I always do so respectfully, to express my desire genuinely, in an authentic search for love and connection. There is **absolutely nothing** wrong with that. In fact, I'm an asshole if I don't approach. She's walking by, looking gorgeous as fuck, and I'm not even going to pay her the compliment of trying to date her? That's extremely rude. Guys who don't approach are assholes. I genuinely believe that.",1

815,816,"The one thing: To get laid with attractive girls and rest deeply in a state of ""pure awareness""I used to be very state-dependent, always chasing it like if it was a drug

Until I realized that the key to be able to successfully connect with anybody at any venue has nothing to do with state

Connecting with others and developing intimacy with girls is about getting close within ourselves first

Doesnt matter what we do to try to fix ourselves, until we realize our inner sense of completeness well never get there

In the past I used to do lots of approaches, different stupid social freedom exercises, I used to learn a bunch of positive mindsets/ frame of reality

But none of these things were really sticking on me, it kind of felt like it was a constant chase and once that I would hit that state the next day it was gone lol

From there I came to the obvious realization that state is useless

Naturals arent state dependent they get laid in all kinds of moods cause they tend to be comfortable and at home with all of the different sensations they feel during a conversation, so why should we be any different?

Some of us are putting an insane amount of effort into trying to improve our body language, voice tonality, eye contact, lines and communication skills, frame, etc 

This takes a lot of mental energy, will keep you stuck in your head and it will keep reinforcing the fact that youre not enough and that you need more

The girls and other people will feel this too

So what about focusing on that one thing that will naturally help with everything else?

In the case, you didnt know the only thing you need to focus on is you

But here Im not talking about the mind, most seduction and self-development school focus on upgrading the mind with new programs but Im sure that many of us already felt the limitations of this paradigm(;

Here Im talking about that which is beyond the mind, the changeless always present You being in tune with this is true masculinity 

It may sound like nice philosophy but this is practical my friend, is an inner experience that once embodied will completely change how you communicate and how people react to you

Since practicing this connecting with strangers and especially girls as become super easy

When I authentically feel like I want to get laid, that same night Ill meet a girl and if the situation will be in our favor well have sex that night otherwise the day after.

When we go beyond the game suddenly things become spontaneous, we stop being limited by the paradigm of pick up and seduction and from there, girls start to experience us as more attractive and they genuinely will stick with us also after sex.

People, in general, will seek us out, invite to social events, cause now they see in us what they are looking for in them, this is the next level, my friend.

Start by giving up the wantingness to attain a certain inner state, realize that you have always been there...

There is nothing that you need to add, you are already complete my friend allow yourself to rest in this realization

""home""= ever-present sense of inclusiveness, that which never changes, that which is beyond every thoughts and emotion and at the same time includes them

818,819,"Pretentious Indie Game SimulatorHi folks, I'm just your average non-binary/genderfluid/trans/differently-abled/autistic/immigrant indie developer from San Francisco.  


The last few years of my life have been very difficult . People have called me mean names on the internet for voicing my empathetic and well-researched opinion on the benefits of veganism. I received so many death threats and dick pics online that I  wasn't able to focus on doing my job. I just couldn't manage to play and  review the latest AAA games for 8 hours everyday. I was very concerned  about my life and mental health.   


So I decided to quit my stressful job working as a part-time writer for a gaming website and moved back to my father's mansion in LA. It was very hard to go back to a  life of solitude after having being used to the chaos of San Francisco.  


While  I lived in LA, I had the extremely difficult job of catching up on all the backlog of games that I had reviewed at my last job without playing.  Through this I discovered something about myself. I discovered my passion for copying other people's ideas and passing them off as my own.  


I knew what I had to do. I had to make my own game. It was literally the only way I could make my voice known.  


I  felt validated when my first post about the game got over a thousand likes. I was so proud that my amazing idea resonated with my 15000+  followers on Twitter. I knew I was onto something special when all my game journalist friends retweeted all of my 74 blog posts about how difficult it was to learn RPG maker to make this game. The idea was so  great that I managed to get the game funded without any sort of  marketing at all! It just goes to show that a good idea is all you need  to really create hype around your game.  


I'm proud to reveal that  I've spent the last 7 months of my life working on my magnum opus. I've put up 3 months of wages on the line into buying the assets for this game. I work on the game all the time. It is so hard to manage with my offshore programming team due to time zone differences. When I'm not streaming obscure 80s DOS games in my pajamas from my bedroom, I am either engaging with the game's backers or trying to explain to my programmer who barely speaks English that I want the game to use a  custom game engine to build the world's most high performance and cross-platform visual novel.  


I like to make games that express how I  really feel inside. I like to express myself online because I can't do that in the real world due to my repressed, shy, and introverted personality.  


This game recounts the first heartbreak in my life when I wasn't asked out to the dance by my high school's quarterback and instead had to settle for a linebacker. It also deals with my childhood's most traumatic horse polo incident. It recalls the liberating feeling when I and my ex-girlfriend simultaneously got our third abortion. It tells the story of a fish out of the water, ignored, who jumps out to discover that the sunshine is just an illusion perpetrated by the capitalist patriarchy.  


This is my story. This is my voice. This is my soul.  


Game features:  
Monochrome pixel art  
A protagonist with depression!  
Lots of walking.  
Cryptic messages.

Like solving a problem involving variable acceleration where it is difficult to imagine where actually it will move fast or slow, how the motion will look, etc. But you have your maths with you to help you with it. It allows you to find the REQUIRED answer of a problem without verifying every statement that comes before by sensing them.",0
836,837,I'm not a physicist but I am a engineering student who completed the physics classes.  What has helped me gain an intuition solving problems is trying to tell a story with the equations.  Also I think about things that happen in everyday situations and try to apply physics to them and think how they apply to the equations.  Hope that helps.,0
837,838,"I like to encourage students to ""do the physics"" before writing the equations. What that means is to figure out what is happening, what physical principles apply, and be able to describe it. I believe very strongly that you (a) need to understand physics both with the ""gut"" (your intuition) and with the brain (the equations) and (b) can learn to do this, with practice.

You already instinctively do physics every day without thinking about it. You assess the speed and trajectory of moving objects, you judge distances, you know what muscles to exert and how hard to jump or throw in various directions, etc.

You just need to expand those instincts. I agree with others that some specific examples can help.",0
838,839,Keep practicing.,0
839,840,"Work on your intuition. 

Practice 'seeing the world with math'. By this I mean connecting your intuition with the numbers in the equation. 

Take F = ma as an example.

What happens mathematically when m increases? (""m gets large, and either F must increase or a must decrease for the equation to hold"") 

What would that mean in the real world?  (""the ball gets heavier, and if you don't push harder, then the acceleration will decrease."")

&#x200B;

By doing this you can slowly build an understanding of physics. Every time you see/hear something you don't understand, test your intuition. If you find that the intuition is wrong, do the math and adjust your intuition accordingly. 

&#x200B;

This is the most fun part of physics, so it's worth the effort! :)",0
840,841,"You might try reading something like Feynmans The Character of Physical Law.  I thought it gave a good introduction to various concepts without just reciting a bunch of formulas.  Have you learned any calculus?  I found I understood some things better when I looked at back after learning calculus.  Beginner physics courses often bypass needing calculus by just giving derived or integrated equations that apply in particular simplified situations, while some get a better understanding by knowing how the given equations were derived.  


Some people also do better when they start thinking about how those concepts apply in day to day life, and are able to get some sense of scale.  This is particularly an issue in America where you might be using USC in day to day life but SI in the classroom.  Mathematically, I can work out that a 10 kg block with an applied force of 100 N should have an acceleration of 10 ms^(-2).  Then think about something you can relate that to, 10 ms^(-2) is about how fast a dense object will fall, 10 KG is a small/medium size dog, or maybe a bag of onions sold at the grocery store, 100 N is about the weight of that dog or onions.  Highway speeds are around 28 m/s, residential areas might have a speed limit of 11 m/s, a typical walking pace is around 1.4 m/s.  Then if you get a question involving a trolley that has a speed of 2 m/s and applied force of 700 N, you can think of that 700 N being about as hard as you would be able to push something and the 2 m/s as a brisk walk to get an intuitive idea what the result should be before you put pencil to paper.  This also helps as a kind of check in that if you make a mistake in your calculation and get a result of something like the trolley weighing 2000 Kg you might notice it doesnt fit with your intuition from above.  

Then again, sometimes it comes naturally over time as you start recognizing patterns in the questions, or you start getting more complex questions and have to apply those formulas in more complex ways.  Sometimes I found my skills grow when I would forget a particular formula while doing a test and work it out from more fundamental ones.  For example, I might not have always remembered the quadratic formula but I remembered enough from reading how it was derived to apply the same process to a test question.",0

951,952,"Until I took the blackpillI thought this was supposed to be a term of enlightenment, people on the old incel subs would say ""Feed him a blackpill before he ropes!"" or things similar. But I've seen a lot of posts of self-loathing and suicidal tendencies that tell me otherwise. What I want to know is why? Why do you all have to hate yourselves for something you had no control over? You didn't ask to be born, you didn't ask to exist in this shitty looksist world. It makes no sense to me to beat yourselves up over being alone, especially if your blackpilled and acknowledge there is little you can do in the way of genetics.

I was like you at one point in time; I hated myself and wanted to die for not being able to attract girls. However, that was when I was bluepilled/ redpilled, when I thought I actually had a chance. I truly thought the reason I wasn't attracting girls was because it was all MY FAULT, that wasn't being assertive, charming, charismatic or acting confident enough, not being enough of a haughty douche. Every time I developed a crush on a girl, I truly thought it was something I had control over, and that if I got rejected and saw her with some 6'5"" muscled-out gorilla- looking-man days later, it was because I had fucked up my presentation, that I had my chance with her but I blew it.

Then one day, after the truth had chiseled away at me long enough to finally break me, I had finally became fully blackpilled. I won't go into detail how it happened; it took forever, a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario, best saved for another post. When I took the blackpill though, it was like a tremendous weight had finally been lifted. Not only did I stop hating myself, but I was able to move on and focus on other things that actually made me happy and love myself. I no longer cared what girls or really anyone thought of me; you'll never impress everyone anyway, so why get shook-up over it?

For example, I was at the local archery range the other day, bettering my aim, when an attractive young lady walked in and took a spot near me. Now I'll admit, my natural instincts caused me to let my guard down and let her in my head. I instantly put pressure on myself to shoot really good and not mess up to impress her, which in turn of course stressed me out bad. But then I quickly came to my senses and told to myself, ""Even if I was the human version of Legolas, there's no way I could flatter her. That would only be if I was a 6'5"" muscled-out nordic chad. Hell, I could be complete shit at archery then, and she would be chomping at the bit to come over and assist me, so she could touch and adjust my arms and feel my muscles and shit.""

And just like that, I calmed down, my mental state was restored, and I was able to go back to enjoying myself and focusing on shooting.

Now I know some of you are going to say ""I wish I could have a girl adore me like that."" Or ""I'll never experience being touched romantically and sensually.""

Well, so what? Why should you care if other people don't like you? If you haven't already, you'll come to learn that 90% of the people you meet are just a bunch of miserable dick-assed weirdos who only enjoy putting others down to make themselves feel better about their own shitty ass lives. They are not worth pleasing.

Also, a lot of people won't get to experience a lot of things. Blind people will never get to see their own face. Deaf people will never get to hear their own voice. A few years ago, there was this four-year-old kid in my town who had to have all of his limbs amputated, or else this horrible genetic medical condition  would kill him. Now he will never get to experience walking, running, jumping or playing, or opening his own birthday presents or taking care of himself or anything really for the rest of his life.

My point is, yes life is terrible, yes life is filled with suffering, but that doesn't mean YOU  HAVE to be miserable every second of every day. As a human being, you are capable of many more amazing things than you realize. As a 25 y/o virgin, I have found so many amazing things to do that made me realize just how amazing I am as a person, and they don't involve having a romantic partner; some of these activities are even more enjoyable when you're alone.

Now I'm sure a lot of you are going to say that I'm just copemaxxing or something. Maybe you're right, maybe it is cope, but then again, maybe it's not. After all, some of these things, to me, like going on outdoor adventures, hunting, fishing, and hiking the AT, PCT, and CDT, feel BIGGER than just settling down with a wife and kids and becoming fully domesticated and tethered down like so many other people do. Plus, being single has it's advantages, like having a 0% chance of ruining your life by having a kid on accident.

The bottom line is, you only live once, you might as well try and enjoy life while you still have it. If the ladies don't like you, then don't sweat it. IT is right, no one is entitled to anything, especially if it involves another person. After all, no one here would like being forced to do something against their will. If girls don't pay you any mind, then fuck it! Who needs them? You can't please everyone, so don't even try. Please don't live to try and please other people, does your one-and-only life belong to those assholes, or you? Live for yourself and no one else.

> Once Anna sought a divorceYou know what my lawyer called him? A parasiteshe, like many other women in her position, was in for a shock. Divorce lawyer Harriet Newman Cohen explains, The law is supposed to be gender-blind. Therefore, when a marriage is breaking up at the insistence of either the breadwinning wife or the supported husband, the lawyer has to apprise the client that when a big-earner wife comes in, the court bends over backward to be gender-neutral, and it is possible the bum is going to be rewarded for sitting on his hands. You do a flip-flop and make believe she is a guy.

> More often than not, this doesnt involve alimony. A lot of men, Ive noticed, feel embarrassed to ask for alimony, says Ken Neumann, since they already know their partners reaction. The wifes idea is, Youre not going to ask for alimony, are you? Its bad enough I was making more than you. ",0

1027,1028,"Went to the bar on Valentines NightSo as the title says, I went to the bar on Valentines with my friend because Im a man looking to find a relationship or casual sex. Couldnt go into the bar because my friend forgot his ID. Classic. I decided to be a bro and stay outside with him and try to get lucky that way (I live in a big city so 1am hangouts outside the bar is a possibility). There were two instances where I had a chance.

1.) Theres this very attractive blonde girl about my height with heeled boots by herself on her phone. Time to shine. I walk up to her and say, excuse me! I introduce myself to her. She does the same to me. I tell her that I think she is a very attractive woman as well as that I would like to get to know her. She tells me Im very sweet with a cute puppy dog face and tells me that she has a boyfriend and that hes picking her up soon. I say thats okay and that Id love to be her friend, so I ask her for her number.

Que the boyfriend pulling up on a motorcycle and revving his engine for her to get on. She tells me thats him and I shake her hand as well as tell her it was nice to meet her and I walk away. About 3-5 minutes later I see the motorcycle drive off and same girl with other people hugging someone which appeared to be a friend, so I walk over to her and asked if she was just dumped to which she replies that shes just meeting him somewhere else. Looking back on that second encounter I feel stupid because I couldve said looks like I have a chance to get that number after all or something like that. Is there any other way I could have handled the second encounter?

2.) There was this other attractive brunette girl that kept exchanging looks with me, but I was too enveloped in a conversation with the group that I was interjecting myself in to go over there. Looking back I should have totally went over there for at least a moment. I was actually about to invite that girl into the group and she walked to the parking lot. How couldve I handled that differently?",0

1032,1033,"Girls want sex too, youre the one that messes it up.&#x200B;

Its very easy today with the (justified) rise of sexual value/marketplace  thinking to get stuck in this frame of thought about women and sex where we assume all hot girls have a shit ton of amazing options (that are better than us).

While this may even be true in a lot of cases, Im not sure its a frame that really serves us as men when it comes to approaching new girls and escalating things sexually. 

You never know where shes at in her desire and life.  Some girls are getting ready to go out tonight really hoping they meet a cool good looking guy.  They arent ALL bombarded by promoters, bottles, rich guy yacht party offers etc. just because theyre beautiful.

So whats the point? The point is that often times girls want to casually date and hookup but we as men fuck it up for them.  

We do this by projecting all these things onto her life without even meeting the girl.  

We do this by judging girls and calling them sluts if they sleep around.  We create an environment where she cant relax and worries (even more than she already did) about being judged by people and especially you. 

Lets try a new approach, the frame of curiosity. If youre going to assume something about her assume that shes a little bit lonely and is EXCITED to meet an awesome dude (hopefully you are one and are working on yourself).  

It may not be the truth, but it will help you approach her with a better vibe and will help you drop some of the negative assumptions that dont serve you at all.

Just some thoughts for the day gents!  Keep pimping.

1044,1045,"Tips for improving physical escalation?Background info:
22M. I noticed that I suck at establishing physical connection with girls during dates and fail to show my romantic/sexual interests fast. So it ends up seeing like I either dont like them or I am just not confident to make moves. 

I (more or less) tick other boxes like eye contact, questions, confidence, jokes and teasing etc. But when it comes to physical escalation, my game SUCKS. 

Firstly, I am not a touchy person in general. Even with close friends or relatives, I prefer to go for handshakes rather than hugs. 

Advice needed: 
How can I improve my physical escalation and make intentions more clear during first dates? I am
also careful trying not to kill the vibes if I go touchy and then she does not appreciate it. I dunno how to work on this.

Actionable and relevant advice from someone with similar issues would very appreciated. Thank you very much.",0
1045,1046,"Learn to be more of a touchy person. Atleast when you are in a private setting with a girl, not public. Like cuddling, putting arm around her, hand holding, stroking her hair. Literally anything like that. Why arent you a touchy person?",0
1046,1047,"Thank you. Sure, If I get to that private setting I can escalate. Problem is before I get there, while we are still
having coffee or dinner etc. 

I think I am not touchy largely because of culture and upbringing. I lived in Eastern Europe for most of my life and there being touchy with a stranger is not very common. After moving to US I realized I was severely lacking in this area.

Also: I cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves. In many cases girls dont initiate physical escalation.",0
1047,1048,"I've got similar issues. I grew up with no siblings and parents who showed zero PDA, even in the home.

>I cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves.

I've learned that they're never going to give signs that they want physical moves. They will only give signs they *don't want* physical moves. If you are close to her and she leans back, she's not ready yet. If she doesn't, you can move to the next step. If she has some kind of accessories on her wrists or fingers, lightly touch her hand/wrist and ask about them. She'll probably be okay with that, so move to the next step. Lightly brush her hair and compliment her on it. If she doesn't move her head back, you can continue moving up. If she does give a *no* signal, go back one or two steps, then work your way from there again. That's basically how it goes.

Now what helps me easing into getting more touchy is creating excuses. If she's wearing heels, take her down a route with some stairs, and lock your arm into hers for ""support"". Go roller skating and take her hand. Teach her how to shoot pool or throw darts--anything that involves touching and moving parts of her body, under the guise that it's not *only* sexual touching. Kinda like innuendo in speech.

One thing I'm keen to try, is at the first meet going for a handshake and instead bring her hand up to kiss it. I live in Japan, and 98% of the female population here goes apeshit over Disney prince/princess crap, so I'm curious how it would play out. From there I could probably go straight to holding hands.",0
1048,1049,"Great tips! Yeah sometimes I am afraid that if I make a move and they move away, I will make everything awkward from that point. But actually playing risky is safer because it will make intentions clear and nobody will wander later where they stand.

In any case, if she likes you, she will reciprocate. There is not much I can do with my moves probably. Its also a mindset thing: I have to remind myself to take this risk just like I remind myself to be confident and ask questions.",0

If he does it in a creepy way they would go, ""Ewww that didn't feel good"". When he does it right, he literally has to tell the girl, ""Don't kiss me!"" because she's reacting so well.

1126,1127,"The people making these films were notorious throughout history (from the era of the Roman Empire all the way up to the first half of the 20th century) for having strong biological impulses to subvert nature and subvert reality.

I haven't seen any of those films because I stopped watching Hollywood years ago, once I realised 90% of films are primarily socially engineering tools and propaganda pieces meant to brainwash. Studies have been done time and time again that show that, in the long-term, the brain is unable to differentiate between what you see visually in real life from what you see visually in film. So if everyone regularly sees smart black women or women who are stronger than men in fictional films, they eventually internalize these as real experiences which is a super effective way of manipulating thought.

I'm sure the people producing these films know this. I wouldn't be surprised if they are  linked to the same people that funded the aforementioned studies.",1

1137,1138,"A question about how you knowSo Ive never had sex. I find the thought of doing it terrifying. I dont know if that makes me ace, or if I had such a conservative upbringing that it ruined my body image and now I dont want anyone to touch me. I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience, and how they knew they were ace? I really want to put this to rest because I feel like I cant move on with my life until I figure this out. And I feel stuck because all of my friends are getting married or are married, and Im the odd wheel in every group. I dont want to feel that way anymore.",0
1138,1139,"Hi! I know exactly what you mean, Im a Muslim girl so Ive grown up in a very conservative household. Ive always been taught to hide my body and not date guys etc. you know what I mean. I first learned that I was asexual when another friend, also from a conservative Muslim family, told me she wanted to have sex with someone. This led me to think about how Ive never actually felt the need to have sex with anyone. Theres many more signs Ive noticed that I can relate with the asexual community, so I think Im more comfortable calling myself asexual now! Im still a work in progress, and Im still figuring myself out. I hope I helped a little :)",0
1139,1140,"Its so nice to hear from someone who had almost the same experience! I definitely feel like I have an unhealthy relationship with my body because of the way I was brought up, but Im not sure it matters if Im never going to be in a relationship. 

I only learned about asexuality about a year ago. I certainly dont want to have sex now, but Im not sure if I ever did. 

I ask this as an Indian girl, what do you do when your parents want you to get married? My parents are getting to that point. I just dont know how to tell them.",0
1140,1141,"Okay omg Ive been wanting to talk to someone about marriage and asexuality. Lately, theres been a lot of rishta (suitors and all) talk in my house because Im almost of age. I know Ill have to eventually talk to my parents about my asexuality which is going to be maaaad difficult. But Ive been dropping hints saying I never ever want to be have kids etc. My parents just tell me to wait a little and youll be ready. Tbh I do want to get married, I just dont want to have sex you know. 

The thing is arranged marriages wont let me find the right person because theres a very very low chance that person is going to be asexual. It remains to be seen I guess. Im dreading the day Im going to have the conversation with my parents, but I know I have to do it.",0
1141,1142,"Me too!! My parents say the same thing, like oh youre young you dont know yet. Though that was a few years ago, I stopped mentioning it now because I dont want to write off the possibility of getting married but yeah honestly, what are the chances of them (or me) finding a guy who is also asexual? How awkward of a conversation would that be? Do you know how youre going to tell them? 

And its also scary to think that when you tell your future husband you dont want to have sex, theyll leave.",0
1142,1143,I admire your courage for asking. Im from a conservative Christian background (. Asexuality was a word I heard when I was a teenager. It sounded like me so I asked a lot of questions and did some research. It just makes sense to me. Self-evaluate and ask questions a lot. You arent the only one who has gone through this. Were in this together.,0
1143,1144,"Thank you for your answer. Did you ever feel like your conservative background made you dislike the idea of sex? I dont know if thats a common thing that happens that I need to investigate further. If its not, then I would be ace for sure. Im just not ready to call myself ace if Im not, because a part of me still wants that heteronormative life where I can go on double dates and couples trips and dinner for two. (I apologize in advance if this is an offensive comment. Im also still learning what aphobia is and how to avoid it in my speech/writing).",0
1144,1145,"Its not offensive, dont worry. I dont think my conservative background contributed to my dislike of sex. When I hear sex talked about I hear that its a gift from God and a beautiful in the proper context. I think I just have a dislike for it. You could be a heteroromantic asexual. It means you are romantically attracted to people of the opposite gender as you but you dont want to have sex with them. Its what I am.",0
1145,1146,"I think I might be the same as you. But isnt it difficult to find a man who is okay with never having sex? I just cant imagine any man being okay with that unless hes also ace, and it seems like asexuality is much less common in men than women.",0
1146,1147,"I have no idea. I havent been interested in or dated many men. I have a boyfriend right now but Im not sure how he would feel about it to be honest. I think he would be okay with waiting until marriage at the least. We will probably have several conversations about it. 

If he loves you he should be willing to wait. He should love you for more than your body.",0
1147,1148,"Hi! I dont grow up in a super conservative household, but I guess thought I should answer anyway. My family is catholic, so theres that. But my parents never made me think sex was a bad thing. Weve always tried to look at it in a positive, healthy light. Except I think Im asexual too. So in my experience, although Ive grown up thinking sex was a natural thing, it hasnt changed my attitude towards sex, and me not wanting it or feeing sexual attraction. Also, you can still be heteromantic! Which means double dates and romantic things with a partner are still something you can do while being asexual. Sorry if this isnt written very well, its a reply on the go!
Good luck and feel free to ask more questions",0
1148,1149,"Thank you for this! Its really helpful to see the perspective of someone who grew up in a more sex-positive environment. I am very doubtful that Ill be able to find a guy who is okay with dating but not sex. I see from this sub that its possible, but I just think the chances are so low. Unless hes also ace, of course, but there are much fewer men who are ace than women (according to the AVEN site).",0
1149,1150,"This is actually quite common for aces and allos alike, But everyone is different. Theres no criteria for being ace. Just imagine yourself in a sexual situation and think about if you honestly want that to happen or not. And remember that if you choose to say you're asexual and later find out you're not, then you're just not asexual!  There's no damage done to the community by misidentifying yourself and you won't offend anyone by changing your labels. They are, after all, just labels.",0
1150,1151,"Thats good to know - I partly dont want to label myself ace because I dont want to change my mind later and have people be like oh, asexuality just means you havent found the right person! Which would be damaging to other ace people they might know. 

For me, if I were to come out as ace, I feel like my parents would sort of give up on me having the normal life we all always thought I would. Theyre great people and theyd support me, but I think theyd be sad deep down that I wont have biological children. Thats why I dont want to come out until Im absolutely sure. And I almost feel like I cant be sure until I do have sex at least once....though thats hard when I havent met anyone Id like to have sex with, haha.",0
1151,1152,"1) it doesn't so much damage the community as it could damage you. The fact that you're even considering the possibility of being ace is mad respect to the community, and changing your label later isn't disrespect. Its self-discovery, and its good. 
2) if you come out to people and you don't think they'll be 100% supportive, explain to them that everything else is exactly how it would be if you were allosexual (meaning not asexual, ""normal""), there would just be some difference too personal for them to be knowing about 
2a)  if its your partner, that's something they definitely should know about. If they really care about you, they'll respect your identity and what that means for your relationship. If they don't accept you, they aren't worth it. 
And just remember that being asexual doesn't mean you aren't worthy of love or that you won't ever be loved. It just means the person who will love you is gonna be that much better of a person.",0

Somewhere in Southeast Asia...

We were all in high school age...

It started with my cousin, the light skin Chad-lite. 

His friend, the normie 6'0"" basketball player. 

And, the young femcel who was about 14-15 years old. She was brown skinned with severe acne problems. Her dry hair is always at chin length and never grew. 

All of us knew each other because we lived in the same area and played together. Then I moved to Toronto.

One day, cousin called me and CACKLED about what happened. He told me that Basketball player, femcel and him went to the outdoor flea market together after school. The femcel suddenly disappeared. They didn't waste a second to wait for her.

""Bro, let's go!"" his basketball friend told him. 

So the him and his friend left her there and went home without telling her. 

I asked him. ""Bro, why!?""

He said. ""Who the fuck am I to wait for her!? She's not even pretty!""

Well, that was mean. 

Fast forward, the basketball player asked her out, for God knows why. She agreed. He never brought her anywhere in public. Never held her hand. Never showed her affection. 

You wanna know why?

My cousin told me that. ""He dated her because he wanna \*have sex\*.""

Out of every place he could've done, he broke up with her in the CROWDED market after HE TOOK HER VIRGINITY. She ended up breaking down into tears in public in front of at least 100 people. My cousin was cackling, telling me all this.

I feel so bad for her.

1296,1297,">Even if it's true that there aren't any openly, media-facing conservatives in the gaming press, it doesn't prove that some clique is keeping them out.

I corrected you on this horseshit the last time you peddled it.  It's not that the utter lack of conservatives proves there is a clique.   It has been *claimed* by an inside source that there is such a clique, and the existence of ONE NAME is all it would take to disprove the allegations. 

And they can't do it.  

>Just as the lack of black superheroes proves that Hollywood is keeping out black people,

1.) The lack isn't total, there have been several black super heroes, and

2.) Hollywood is on the record as constantly bending over backwards to prove how woke and diverse they are. 

Compare that to the games journalists who can't give us ONE NAME and who are on social media continually acting in exactly the ways an anti-conservative clique would in fact act.    If there wasn't a single black super hero in Hollywood and famous actors and directors were on Twitter constantly talking about how much they hate black people, then maybe you'd have a successful analogy.

Simply put: In order for a man to be happy and at peace, he must have a presently unattainable goal.


------


Let's jump right into it. Your personal deficiencies are going to be very different from the other guy (and your past self as you grow up and evolve). To expound on the second point, what I cared about at 17 was of the utmost importance to me at 17, but has no relevance to me now. Likewise, my expectation of achieving the goals I set for present-day me would be outrageous at that time.

That means in plain English that my mission in life at 17 was as follows:

* Graduate high school
* Hold on to the relationship with my girlfriend

My unattainable at 17 was:

* Get into my ""dream"" college  

When the unattainable is achieved, something new must take its place. **Failure to do this creates existential agony until an appropriate obstacle is in place to calm that nerve once again**. What do I do now when I achieve what felt like the unattainable? I invent a new unattainable. However, this lesson took some time to learn.

My college mission was as follows:

* Break up with high school girlfriend
* Make grades
* Rush the fraternity I wanted to be in

My unattainable at the time was as follows:


* 


Yep, nothing. This is where my journey stalled. I never bothered to think past my last unattainable into a new one! After all, I had already done the impossible. I was perfect and needed no further improvement in my mind.

I briefly got back together with the high school girlfriend long distance. It was, as my football coach put it, an ""other than positive experience"". See the problem?

----

This applies to men of literally any age. I use a teenage example because it will resonate with boys and men alike, but the message is the same: whether your limitations are sex, money, power, wealth (believe me, that is different than money), or fame (a thing many people hamster into attaining the other 4 aforementioned), you need to understand that without some seemingly unattainable goal to strive for you will never continue to be a man.


The core act of being a man involves becoming a different man worthy of surpassing self-defined milestones. The unattainable should be a combination of ""a thing you've never done before and have limited hope of achieving RIGHT NOW"" and ""things men you admire and respect have done before"". 

Fortunately for our dear readers, many are probably major losers right now. This unattainable can be as low as ""kiss a new girl"" or ""earn a promotion / earn $46,575 a year"". THIS IS A GOOD THING. Your self-actualization depends on actually achieving these goals, *just not in your current mindset, body, or frame.*

For the avoidance of confusion, your current mission should be:

1. Specific
2. Measurable
3. Attainable
4. Relevant 
5. Timely

Your current unattainable may or may not be any of these things - you have the freedom to decide. The only requirement is that the unattainable must be grand enough that you are currently unworthy. Hold yourself to this principle, and you will evolve rapidly into the man you want to be.",0

I would prefer it if people acted like goddamn adults around the subject of sex, and treated it with the respect it deserves rather than a casual evening's entertainment. I also realize that there are enough people unable or unwilling to do such. I am willing to live with abortion as a result.

If your girlfriend has an abortion and you did not want to be in a relationship with someone who would get an abortion, you did not ask the right questions and get honest responses before having sex.

I have always had an issue about my looks and that has really stifled me in taking action because I know, Ill get rejected. Hear me out, for a 30yr old hard-case newbie, rejection hurts a ton. 

So yesterday, I went to a shopping mall, did some shopping and went out to another store to make an account payment. Whilst there, I was spoke to the girl who was assisting and at some point we had a moment of banter and I was like okay, maybe I should ask her out. 

Once I did the payment, I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and I got a no. From there I said, its ok, I understand. Weirdly enough, I felt good and I was okay with her choice. Her rejecting me didnt make me any less of a man. 

My mental critic tried to spin it off to say she rejected you because of your horrible crooked teeth (Im getting braces next month) and your horrible face but all I knew was, I was getting somewhere and being rejected doesnt make me any less of a man. 

Ill try to face my approach anxiety and continue to grow. Im really proud of what I did.

You have to build a certain level of trust and rapport before you can hang out w/ her. Next time you should ask for her number or social media instead of asking her to hang out right away.

So today I was at a trampoline park with a friend. We ended up playing dodgeball against two very cute girls.
After we played 2 rounds I approached one of them.
Me: ""Hey wait a second""
Her: ""Oh hey""
Me: ""Don't worry I don't want to sell you anything, I just think you are very cute. Do you maybe want to grab a coffee sometime?""
Her: ""Oh I'm sorry but I have a bf""
Me: ""Well maybe then a coffee as friends?""
Hey: ""sry I don't think this will be possible""

So basically a flake again but I got her Instagram",1
1592,1593,"dont push for it.

As friends is a bad line, if she wants to spend time with you then she'll either...

A. agree and not mention the boyfriend

or

B. tell you ""sure as friends""

or

C. ""I have a boyfriend but we could as friends"" (I would avoid this since you wont get anywhere)",0
1593,1594,"I agree with you, but I still think what he did was good. It seems as he's in the beginning process of figuring out the ropes. And in that period it's good to find out what can be done and what can't. I would always say push it until you see she becomes uncomfortable, or directly tells you she isn't interested, just to see what the limits are.",1
1594,1595,Did you ask for her social afterwards?,0
1595,1596,This doesn't look like a success.... Regardless of whether she has a bf or not she is not interested. You should of dropped it and not insist that is creepy. She didn't even wanted to be friends so i don't see the point here. She probably just wanted another Instagram follower and hoped you won't bother her lol.,0
1596,1597,"Its a success regardless because he tried. People are way too tied into results. Once he does this enough he will get there, its the beginning thats tough. I applaud you good sir keep going dont give up!! One approach a day this is inspiring stuff I am doing this next!!",0
1597,1598,"It isnt success if trying is overridden by being creepy. Yes there is an effort but in a bad sense , it is not healthy. It isn't about results you can try normally and fail issue here is insisting that is big no no.",0
1598,1599,"Asking to have coffee as friends is not unhealthy or insisting. Who knows how she felt about it. Clearly this is a starting point. Its better than not doing anything and sitting around wondering what wouldve happened. Yes this wasnt a good approach to it and I always think connecting with a girl on a human level must come first before asking them out, but baby steps.",0
1599,1600,Look I am okay with trying cold approach that is good practice nothing wrong with that. However if you turn interactions to this it would not go anywhere and you mess up all the effort you put. You basically can cut it when you supposed to and don't leave other party in stress and don't waste time yourself. Simple as that. This is bad for both parties. Asking a coffee as a friend is just plain lie and both parties know about it. So let's pass that.,0
1600,1601,What part of it is creepy? He just did 2 questions. How is that insisting dude?,0
1601,1602,"He asked same questions initiating contact. f girl says she has bf she either told you a lie which you should leave her or she has a bf you should leave her. Then you don't go and ask for a coffee as friends everyone know reality here , then when she says she doesn't even want a coffee as friends you don't get her Instagram. It is just plain creepy and me getting downvoted would not change this fact.",0
1602,1603,"I don't know who downvoted, but I get where you are coming from. Is kinda pushy, but from the info that OP posted there's no way to say it's creepy. If a girl tells you she has a boyfriend doesn't mean you are prohibited to talk to her, although obviously one should uderstand she is not interested. 

I don't know OP but if he is starting to put himself outhere this counts as a win, since he haven't (allegedly) been disrespectful. The fact that he has not yet the social skills down, at this stage is irrelevant. 
(If you are OP reding this, good for you. Just keep in mind your surroundings, and be respectful)",0
1603,1604,Yeah I mean trying and such as I said in my other response is good practice and definitely confident booster. However being pushy just spoils that. It wastes further time for you and you can creep others. So not good. Well I haven't been there but If she has rejected him 2 times it doesn't sound like she been comfortable. If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to. Plus girls care a lot about Instagram followers these days ( lame but true ). Anyway OP try what you trying ( cold approach ) but be sensible on people's boundaries please.,0

""Do you want to grab a coffee?""

See how this one sounds more direct and confident?  When you say maybe and sometime, it makes you seem uncertain with your self-confidence.  Women hate uncertainty.  They love spontaneity, but hate uncertainty.

Practice leaving these words out of your vocabulary when you ask women out and you'll notice you'll appear more confident, which can lead to better results.",0

She only beat the kid when she was drunk, and was drunk three times a week.  How many days a week does one need to be *drunk* to be considered regular?

The point is to be congruent.
Best is to congruently be alpha as fuck.

If you can't pull off being a badass with congruence... Then next best is to be as close to alpha as you can, while maintaining congruence.

Worst of all is congruently being a ""niceguy"" beta.


That said, I'd like to see some good examples of different styles of game. Most coaches I've seen have a very similar style. It's a laid back, witty, sexual vibe... That, while alpha, is hard for beginners to pull off congruently.

All this mockery of her is just people justifying their sadism against women they view as unattractive at the end of the day.

1816,1817,"To get right-wing moids to give half a f\*ck about your existence, follow these 10 easy steps!

&#x200B;

1. Be white, preferably Anglo-Saxon. Nordic or Germanic is also good.
2. Be skinny. Anything over the exact center of the chart for a healthy BMI range is unacceptable. But also have big boobs.
3. Be blonde.
4. Be young. Women over 30 are past it. Women over 35 are useless parasites.
5. Be from a wealthy family. Right-wing politicians don't actually care about working-class whites.
6. Be beautiful. Anything under high-tier Becky is pointless.
7. Be married. Any unmarried woman over 25 is clearly defective or a tradthot.
8. Be a conservative 'Christian'. Love your neighbour, as long as said neighbour is wealthy, healthy, conservative and white.
9. Talk about men's issues constantly. Forget about women who are experiencing poverty, domestic violence, sexual abuse or mental health issues. Men need more attention, since the feminazi's are out to turn their sons gay and make their wives run away with black men.
10. Say the words 'Tradition', 'Illegal immigration, 'Crime' and 'Libtard' at least once every sentence.",1
1817,1818,"I'm confused by this post. For starters - Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot""? She's an attractive skinny white blond woman who spends her internet time trying to get people to shit on shooting survivors. I guess ""hot"" means looking like idiot mean girl Tomi Lahren?

All of these people style themselves based on high school mean girls and Ann Coulter.

  They're all minions of disgusting right wing mouth breathers who secretly wish we lived in ""Handmaid's Tale"" Gilead, rape was legal, and it would probably be legal to murder ugly women or women and little girls who protested rape with impunity.

She **does** deserve it. No offense OP - but the woman you're posting is right on target, if what she's saying is true.  Fuck Kaitlin Bennett. I enjoy when misogynistic women reap what they sow. You think they're allies? They're not. They're not worth spilling tears for either. And I'm saying this as someone that finds the left as creepy, looksist, and secretly often as misogynistic as the right, so long the selected target is white (maybe Asian), cisgender - shit, even a lot of their attacks on men frequently strike me as fucked up and underwritten by ulterior motives totally divorced from any real, sustainable concept of justice, logic, or interpersonal accountability. Caitlin Jenner - who spent her pre-transition life as a right-wing jock with no interest in problems for women or sexual minorities and apparently has the same politics now, theoretically at her own detriment (but not literally of course - she's rich) - being lauded as a heroine is proof of that, frankly.

I'm just sort of at a loss as to how Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot"" but I don't give a shit if misogynistic women reap what they sow. Fuck right, they deserve it. They're agents of the men who want to put their favorite hookers in cabinet positions (Berlusconi), make rape legal, illegalize any medication or health procedure women need to participate in society as equals/control their own reproduction, and create a right wing theocracy. 

No sympathy.

Also - whoever this LivPosting is, she's not actually a hot chick or any ""hotter"" than Bennett; she strikes me as an average looking woman calling out a blond bimbo wannabe for supporting an ideology that leaves ""not hot"" chicks out in the cold, so...I dunno, what is the point of this post again? 

This woman isn't justifying looksism, she's pointing out the consequences of hypocrisy and being felled when you charge for misogyny and misogynistic ideology while female. Do you not see that? Are you offended because of your politics (in which case, I guess I should apologize for speaking so frankly) and the apparent anti-woman mindset of this Liv Posting? 

Are you really caping for hateful anti-feminists like Kaitlin Bennett, who are even less sympathetic to femcels and ugly women than even shitty corporate ""liberal"" feminists who are as focused on virtue signalling for a paycheck as anything else (like our wonderful friends at Mel Magazine, who have such contempt for the women here they'd lift their posts without asking) and have no empathy for real women if they have a self-serving goal in mind? 

The whole point of these posts is that Kaitlin Bennett supports a misogynistic society where looksism and sexism used against women is embraced. She's a (horrible, hateful, stupid, famewhore) woman without a country.

I'm sorry if you're conservative and that's why you're irked here.


Right and left - be it vocal, performative antifeminism voiced by babes of Fox primetime, Tomi Lahren, Meghan McCain, and Bennett; or highly visible corporatized ""feminist"" values presented by shitty faux-""woke"" startups that are revealed to treat their employees like garbage/shitty ""content"" spewing blogs like Mel, at al are mostly predicated on two things, two gods they worship in kind - self-serving engagement numbers, and money. So they support quashing labor laws and fair wages and fair medical leave and HRs that actually treat sexual harassment seriously and, in Bennett's case, try to jumpstart a career by inciting people to wish murder on high schoolers that watched their friends die, wearing AKs as accessories. On top of whatever right wing woman-hating horseshit she's promoting while hustling for a speaking engagement on the neocon airwaves.

Those antifeminists are the ultimate pickmes and only support feminism (for themselves, primarily, and perhaps women exactly like them) to justify...anti-feminism. To justify pushing the overturning of Roe v Wade. To justify ""my choice is a feminist choice because I have a vagina! (There's no such thing as marital rape! Let's murder gay people and burn witches again! Rah rah rah! Let me show you my tits!)""-style feminism, from their seats of influence, their soap boxes and promotional events. 

They're all united with one idea in mind - so long as I get mine (get my abortion, my featured piece, my seed funding, can roast other women alive for deserving to be harassed/raped, can use a shitty hashtag phonily presenting any incident where a woman is victimized, polarizing men and woman in the aftermath or something like a high profile revelation of a sex crime) - fuck everyone else. Fuck facts. I want the spotlight.

My friend is married with two very young children. He is a textbook extrovert. He had an active bachelor life, never a problem getting women. He wasn't RP, he just did MANY RP things without realizing it. He has an almost magical ability to get people to follow him and subscribe to his ideas. He lies very easily and convincingly. He has the dark triad down pat. Since childhood, he has created a number of memes (Dawkins definition, not internet definition) within our friends group that stuck for months. On top of that, he rakes in a comfortable six-figure salary in the finance field.

But the curious thing about this man, who I consider a brother, is that he's never wanted to be a leader. The thought turns him off. And he has always gone for women he could be submissive with. ""Alpha in the streets, beta in the sheets,"" doesn't quite describe it. More like beta in the house as soon as he steps through the door.

His wife comes from money. Big family, not divorced. She is, for the purpose of this discussion, otherwise a typical woman. A little more neurotic than most, but typical nonetheless. She took a high turnover job that she was doing when they met. She stopped doing that job because it was ""stressful"" (and really it is, but c'mon, could you imagine quitting), and stayed home to take care of the kids. But her quitting predates the pregnancy.

____

Lat year my friend had a tragedy in his family, the kind that will weaken any man. Most women will allow you to be weak for 1, maybe 2 days. But in him this persisted. And eventually he displayed the **ultimate form of weakness**: he considered suicide. Even worse, he told her. 

So she did what women do and dragged him to a couples therapist where most of the time was spent with her berating and ""venting"" about him. And, he tells me, they would always come back from therapy seemingly worse than when they began. This is a stereotype that I think we've heard about  a lot. I was very disheartened to see it play out so clearly, so close to home. And I'm not even kidding, you could have scripted it. Really saddening stuff.

So of course she did what any woman does when she sees her man hit rock bottom for a prolonged period of time. She supported him throughout in a very nurturing way and built him back up. 

Ha. Come on. 

No, she kicked him out. He is now simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

___

So what I'm seeing is possession on both sides. She is the one making all the decisions and she has simply switched off to him. There is no getting through to her. She has somehow turned his thoughts of self harm against him and made it about her. You know what I'm talking about. When a girl gets to that point, becomes that brick wall. She becomes a stranger. It's a terrifying thing to go through if you've never seen it before. That's her animus possession.

And he, he is reduced to begging. He wants to ""fight"" for her. He is purely following his emotions. He is talking too much. He is a shadow of who he was, taking a one-two punch of his family tragedy early, and now this new tragedy. His anima is in charge.

___

Underlying this is a jarring reality: I have looked up to this man my whole life. I have mimicked and copied some of the things he does as an example, with some really good success. This is a guy who has made the right moves since day 1. While I was fucking around with my head in the clouds, making mistake after mistake, he always -almost naturally- knew the right thing to do.

Now I am worried about him. I am worried about losing my brother. And he has already been seeing therapists all year, both on his own and the couple. I think I might be the only one on his side, because I know that despite all his genius he has never been here before and doesn't know what to do. And that's why he is making the wrong moves. If I didn't now what I know, my reaction would also be to distance myself because no one likes a downer. But I know everyone else is doing that. 

After the shoe does drop, I'm going to try to guide him correctly. But I've only ever rescued myself from the anima before. It took months, almost a year. I just need him to not fucking kill himself.",1
1968,1969,"Whats with the science-jargon Im seeing in posts lately?

Seen this a few times, did that myself until I found TRP (except the marriage part). Guy who's popular and good with girls assumes that this means he's alpha and/or RP thus immune to classic ""post marriage zero sex"" or assumes he can do no wrong and goes full BP.

1980,1981,"The sidebar here would be helpful to him. I can relate to this some. Before there was TRP, many men were like your friend. They did RP things naturally without realizing it. But they also had to learn other RP things the hard way. Some learned, others (most) never really figured things out. I was in the former category. If I wasn't sure how to handle something, I'd either be aloof or rude and found that that typically got the results I wanted. Finding this sub and other info online helped with explaining the ""why"" behind certain behaviors working or not working.

2042,2043,"That's odd. The professors argument goes against my understanding of ""fair use"". Great, I hope I can follow up on this later and learn something.

The way I've understood it thus far, it is ""fair use"" to use a piece of copyrighted material if you are providing critique, commentary, education, satire, etc *on that material.* Providing commentary on copyright law in general is not commentary on that piece of music.

Of course, there is no market usurpation, and I'm sure a minimal clip was used, though that might not be enough of a defense. The nature of the work is clearly a for-profit music arrangement in an artful and novel expression.

In effect, nobody is claiming this *isn't* copyright infringement, but is it really *fair use?*  
It'll be fascinating to see where this goes and what effects, if any, it will have on automated copyright strikes, because automatic systems probably can't do the research required to make a good faith judgement as required by the DMCA.

From what I've listened to so far, it seems as though short clips were played to highlight an example of what would be Fair Use and what wouldn't. And that makes sense, you can't sufficientw highlight examples without at least a few short clips of the music in question, and would fall under Fair Use.

2094,2095,"Withdrawing A Guilty Plea Before Sentencing?Please excuse if this question has been answered before. I am new to reddit and don't have much time to help my friend who I believe has been pressured into pleading guilty to a crime he does not believe himself guilty of. I will refer to him as David here, however this of course is not his real name and I will not provide any identifying details even if asked.

David is considering trying to withdraw his guilty plea, for the following reasons:

What happened:

1. Five minutes before his plea was due, whilst at the court, he was told the prosecution had completely rewritten the description of the charges against him, to which he claims to be innocent of and has much proof of.
2. He was told by his solicitor he 'will' be found guilty of the new charge by a jury because they will all hate him and ignore his evidence.
3. He was told he will not get 1/3 off his sentence if he does not admit his guilt right there and then. He was told it would be expensive to defend himself and that pleading guilty will save everyone a lot of money.
4. He argued with his solicitor that it did not feel right but minutes later they were called to the court room.
5. As he walked to the courtroom with his solicitor he was told again he should say guilty when asked.
6. Just before he was asked to plea the judge offered an adjournment of a few days to allow defence to consider the rewritten charge, however his solicitor declined the offer without consulting my friend at all.
7. During the plea itself the defence solicitor mouthed plead guilty multiple times at my friend as he hesitated.
8. The rewritten charge arbitrarily changed the period of the offence from a couple of months, to a whole year and included additional un-provable claims not stated before.
9. Later he was told that he could put in a basis of plea setting out his version of events and disputing certain accusations that form the charge. The basis of plea was then submitted but the CPS is saying they will not accept it because it was not agreed at the time of the plea hearing.

In addition to the above, David is suffering from chronic depression, officially homeless, often suicidal and very, very vulnerable at this time. As a result, he is very easily influenced and due to the nature of the charges, finds if very hard to argue his innocence without people saying he sounds more guilty by doing so, or he is minimising the offence.

IANAL but from my understanding of both the evidence and his explanations. I do not believe him guilty of this crime, although I admit I may be biased and it is a complicated case. He is in a really terrible place at the moment and I want to help him as best I can before what I believe is a miscarriage of justice occurs.

Please could someone advise how he might go about asking to withdraw his plea, if this is even possible given the circumstances. His own solicitor has threatened to resign from the case if my friend tries to change his plea now, leaving him undefended with very little time to act before his sentencing.",0

You find young people at the cheaper hostels where they can still tolerate 10+ people dorms and sharing only one shower. When we evolve past shoestring budget and can spare a few more dollars for <4 person dorms and an outlet for everyone, the crowd gets older too because their budget isn't as narrow as the younger counterparts.

You have two options, simply switch hostels if you don't like your experience or just deal with it until you move on. You'll definitely have great travel interactions at some point but it's normal that they're not occuring 100% of the time. That's why they're special moments.",0

2168,2169,"My improved posture has completely changed how men and women treat me in one dayI recently wanted to stop talking to women to focus on improving myself, and to detox, and very quickly, one of my self improvements was chest up, chin up and shoulders back. The look straighten my body from head to toe, and gave my vibe/look like one of those super confident attractive guys look that you rarely see. I have to admit, the results have been life changing.

This all happened last 48 hours

First off, a lot of women stare, and for much longer. The first women was on a date with a guy at a bar, and in-between small talk with the guy  I had to go to the bathroom. Well, there are mirrors that I can see him and his date as I walk away either direction, and all I saw was this guy's date have the most memorizing stare I've seen on a girl. Right in front of him. Nothing held back. Beautiful girl btw, but I'm not a terrible person, so I would never encourage guy hopping while on a date. The look gave that ""this guy is so interesting"". They haven't been dating long it turns out.

On the same night, a more heavy set girl and her friend stand behind me at the bar. I look behind me, and I see two genuinely nice smiles. I'm not into bigger women, personally, but I still found it really nice.

Next day at work, a female customer did a tripple take at me. One coworker checked me out from head to toe with a smile, and a 2nd coworker is straight up looking to rebound her break up by putting a lot of really cute effort into being close to me, and having me notice her. She does these really attractive/confident stare with a smile. Did a little small talk, but the sexual tension was so intense. I might actually be down for what she's looking for. I actually really liked her sway when she  walked passed me for no reason and then looked back at me to see if I noticed her. Her flirt was up to 11.

 last night, at the bars and club, another heavy girl flat out put my friend down because she thought he was ugly and I was attractive, and said she was down to fuck. That one pissed me off. So I shut her down by letting her know she's shitty. I leave to a new bar, and IMMEDIATELY, a wicked cutie hits on me which I assume is a one nighter she's looking for. I fucked that one up because I was so caught off guard, and ended up saying things that sounded like I was rejecting her. (Oops). I wasn't thinking before I spoke, so I ended up saying things that made her feel hurt.

Finally, my male friend straight up told me I was clearly a really good looking guy. This one felt so nice, because he's a really good dude, and straight men don't normally tell me that. (Bless you)

The rate of attention I got wasn't anywhere close to this before I decided to actually look confident. I also feel more powerful. I'm 6'4, and now look properly strong. Mentally and physically, girls and guy notice my vibe, and want to be around it.

So now it's day three, and about to go to work. And make the bar after. Based on all the attention with my new posture, I look forward to how people will treat me.

Update: at the bar right now. Haven't been looking around much, but have caught two 8s stealing glaces. One of them double takes and held the stare for a long time. Not sure how else to explain this shit.",0

My biggest bit of advice is to keep one sling for your arm while exercising and wear another one normally. Youll get very sweaty so its good to have one sling designated for workout duty.

2438,2439,"Scared about not having enough/Getting more suppliesHi y'all. I live alone in an apartment. I started prepping in late Feburary when I panic-bought beans, toilet paper, and paper towels online. In retrospect, I should've been less embarrassed about prepping, and I should've bought more, but that's my fear right now.

From my late-Feburary panic-buying, I have enough food + supplies to last 1.5-3 months. But I'm worried it's not going to be enough.

How are y'all coping with the fear of not having enough food? Are you guys planning on restocking? If so, how?

Thanks! And stay safe and healthy out there!",0
2439,2440,I am in constant fear of not having enough.,0
2440,2441,Same here.,0
2441,2442,Yup. Lost sleep over it last night. I feel you,0
2442,2443,"One long term, easily accessible prep to take care of this kind of anxiety is wheat which is very inexpensive at about 40 USD per 50lb (22.6kg) bag.  That is low enough in price that you can continuously add new wheat to storage without impacting the bottom line.  You can do the same with beans and rice, but they don't store quite as well, and you can do the same with pasta which also stores well.

End result .. no worries, because you can prep long term with these kinds of dry goods for as long as you want, really .. and yeah, it might not be fun to sit around doing nothing but eating bread and drinking water, but you'd survive.

I mean if you were super worried about some meteor hitting the earth or something, you could literally have half a U.S. standard short ton of wheat (1000lb) for 800 USD, which is like 1.5 MILLION CALORIES ... which at 2000 calories a day would last you like 700 days ..

With enough storage space and about as much money as a car you could probably buy enough wheat or pasta to literally feed you for the rest of your natural life, and just check ""food"" off your list.",0

2523,2524,"How To AMOG Beta MalesIt shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.

Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.

2539,2540,">1)In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals

I agree. There's one other category I would add to this, the ""feel good"" posts that are generally written in a poetic, metaphoric style without conveying any useful information besides the ""you should feel awesome and great"" vibe that so many generic, often liberal, self-help writers tended to write after PUA got into mainstream and they had to sell their stuff with sleazy tactics like appealing to the emotions and storytelling - instead of letting the work defend itself. Few recent examples I could name is The next generation, Demonstrating unique value, Animus possesion, The case against PUA and Dich cold approach posts.


>2)They want the male who has what others don't 

That's not true at all. They want the male who other women want. For example women don't want the one eyed midget with hunchback, they want the rockstar which other women want. Being unique is NOT equivalent to being an alpha. 

>3) and can thus disrupt the status quo

No woman wants a man who disrupts status quo. As demonstrated by 3,5 billion women living today, they all want the rockstar, the famous actor, the famous athlete and so on - regardless of the woman's culture or economic background the same principles apply. Disrupting the status quo is not enough, you also need to become ""famous for disrupting status quo"". Otherwise the ""status quo disruptor"" without the ""famous"" part is just a party pooper no woman wants to associate herself with b/c he lowers her status. 
 

>4) Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation

> you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males

That's not true at all. Here you're advocating for not hitting the gym and not lifting b/c it imitates the strategy of an athletic men that are successful with women thanks to being athletic. 


Imitating what other men did is not the endgame, it's a tool. You look at what the best sprinters in the world did before you, you analyse their training patterns, their workouts, diet etc and then you create your own, tailored to your own needs. 


If you want to learn how to write complicated intellectual posts you read complicated intellectual books. By reading enough of them and by understanding how and why authors wrote what they wrote you begin to develop your own understanding and by writing you develop your own style. Neither the understanding nor the style would be possible without the authors before you b/c you looked at what they wrote, adopted what you liked and added your own unique style to it. 

IOW, do get creative but don't waste time reinventing the wheel.


>5) When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance?


Never if you don't have to. If you want to proactively AMOG some other dude it's only b/c he has higher social value than you and you want to take him down or the dude is threat to you (meaning he's there to steal your girls). There is absolutely no need to AMOG if you're the alpha of the set, if you're the most attractive or the most desired. 

AMOGing for the sake of AMOGing (getting verbally or physically aggressive toward everyone all the time) is not attractive b/c it demonstrates lack of social intelligence and communicates you're an antisocial sperg. AMOGisn should be a tool not your personality.



>6) No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs.

Steve Jobs was the boss of the people who called him an asshole. IOW he paid them to do what he told them to do, however he told them is irrelevant b/c he's the boss and he's paying. The situation is different if you're not the boss, for example you are looking to get some capital from a venture or angel. Try being an asshole to VC and see how it works out. 

If you have the power you can behave like an asshole and be famous for it, be forgiven for it sometimes even liked for it. If you don't have the power, you're just an asshole.


> 7)A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident.

Nobody on TRP belives in that. This was true in 2005-ish PUA days and got corrected on TRP a long time ago.

>8) Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition.

This is not true. An alpha BECOMES an alpha when he ""defeats"" his competition. By definition her orbiters (men she's won't fuck) are not your competition, the other men she's fucking are. Since she already knows they are beta, you're not competing with them you're mentally masturbating about how cool you are and how the orbiters are not. This is pointless behaviour reminiscent of incels hating on guys who fuck.

If you want to meat your real competition do this (joke/no joke): next time a plate sends you ""i wanna fuck"" text, respond with ""dont have time"". Then stalk her and see who she's fucking besides you. 9/10 is some scrub badboy/bordeline junkie who is just chill as fuck and has good vibe women enjoy. And that's b/c while working on your looks is important part of the sexual strategy, it's not the only one that matters.

Embassy staff stated flatly that the cartoon is an insult to China and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people. In 2018, similarly, [Chinas ambassador in Ottawa](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/the-lies-and-insults-that-china-has-pointed-at-canada/) said Canadas arrest of a politically connected Chinese tech executive was motivated by white supremacy.

In one [2016 ad for laundry detergent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/china-racist-detergent-advert-outrage), a Chinese woman stuffed a detergent pod into a black mans mouth and shoved him into a washing machine.

2550,2551,"This isn't surprising in the least.

China is a postcolonial revanchist ethnostate, and its entire state ideology is really a kind of fascism driven by the same sense of humiliation which fueled German Nazism. 

Their entire state ideology is about reclaiming China's ""rightful position"" in the world as the ""middle kingdom"" (by which they mean the center of the world), which they see as having been ""stolen"" from them during the Century Of Humiliation (the colonial period). They were one of the first *incubators* of the ideology of post-colonial grievance. 

CCP ideology is basically Nazi, but replace ""Aryan"" with ""Han Chinese."" They demand Tibet and East Turkistan as *Lebensraum* for instance. 

Chinese Socialism has always been, from the very start, a nationalist project (even to this day, the CCP regards Sun Yat-Sen as its forefather despite Sun Yat-Sen being the founder of the rival Kuomindang). 

Of course the CCP lob the ""racist"" accusation at the West. Their entire state ideology is built on an experience of unfair treatment at the hands of Western colonial powers (and with some exceptions, such as Hong Kong, the simple reality is that the Western colonial powers DID treat China appallingly). 

The reality, however, is that the West eventually realized that racism, colonialism and the like were bad things. The Chinese government, on the other hand, has no such moral scruples. Imperial China, and even present-day China, engage/d in absurd levels of racism and colonialism (they subjugated their Asian neighbours frequently, with no remorse whatsoever). 

I mean the blunt reality is that slavery, oppression, imperialism, colonialism and such was the *reality of human history up until the last few centuries*. Almost every civilization engaged in these things to some degree, and almost every civilization was the victim of these things to some degree. The West *absolutely* engaged in them... just like everyone else.

The West's record is distinguished only by two things: first, the formalization of the scientific method and the resultant industrial revolution made the West more capable at engaging in these things. Secondly, the ideas of the enlightenment ultimately made Westerners come to the conclusion that slavery, racism, imperialism and colonialism were all bad things. The West didn't invent slavery, but the West was the first civilization to abolish it. 

Yet the West is asked, unlike every other civilization, to contemplate and repent for its own sins. Despite the fact that we were the first people to realize they were sins, and the first people to develop a philosophy which consistently opposed all of these things. 

When the Chinese government calls you a racist, tell them to look in the mirror. There's a reason the Christchurch Gunman said the PRC was the state most aligned with his values... the PRC is a fascist, ethnonationalist, racist, colonialist shithole, and Beijing is guilty of every sin it accuses the West of committing.",0
2551,2552,"All good points. Though to add briefly, it also pays to spotlight the Taiwanese/ROC: as on top of being themselves shaped by the Century of Humiliation, they followed a different postcolonial path that makes them as close to what a Free China would be like as one could imagine.

2571,2572,"Broad Ripple Ping Pong MeetupI want to start a Broad Ripple ping pong meetup and could use suggestions for potential meeting spots. My thought is that perhaps I could buy a couple of ping pong tables and convince a local community center allow me to host the events and store the tables there for a fee. First, is anyone interested in joining a meetup like this? Also, anyone have ideas for locations? Here are the only location ideas I've thought of so far:

 Ask the Indianapolis Arts Center (seems like a stretch, but worth a shot)

 Transport the tables to a local park, like Broad Ripple Park or Canterbury (maybe by laying some portable table tops on top of picnic tables?)

 Give up on hosting in Broad Ripple and either host at Smash Social downtown or the outdoor tables at Carmel's midtown plaza",0

2627,2628,"I'm a bit desperate to find an IDE / Editor tool set that actually worksIt's been now a couple of weeks since I've started learning Haskell.
**My impressions so far:**
It's beautiful.

The syntax is clear and unlike other languages like scala you're not constantly wondering: ""Is this actually functionally pure?"", because the language itself won't allow you to write impure code. 

Anyways, now I wanted to start a larger project and learn about game development with the ""SDL2"" library. 

At a first glance game development in haskell sounds like a great idea as it allows you to write nice, stable and composable functions. 

I finally learned enough about stack, cabal and the project structure to get the libraries installed. I wished there was more beginner friendly documentation, but I managed.

**The part I did not manage to get through, is the the environment / toolset part.** And it's not because I need more knowledge, but I'm finding a LOT of bugs that break something.

**Intelli-J default plugin**
* Best experience so far. Easiest to install, but it does not have a debugger as far as I know.

**Intelli-J haskforce**
* Crashes at start. I tried to compile the latest bug-free version but the gradlew script also crashes.

**HIE**
* Crashes. Haven't gotten it to work.

**GHCIDE**
* This one works pretty well, however there are some undocumented errors that happen with certain default files. For example I have to delete ""Setup.hs"" for it to actually work.

There is veeeery little documentation on how to create a ""hie.yaml"" file to exclude these files.

**Phoityne-vscode debugger for VSCODE**
* Crashes as well trying to debug a .hs file that definitely compiles and runs. It complains about some characters when jumping over to the next function.

I'm pretty desperate because so far I have spent much more time trying to build the toolset than to actually code anything.

So, if you allow me the question, what is the current best editor / IDE / toolset combo as of 2020? Something complete and easy to install.

I really don't want to leave haskell, because it's the most popular ""pure"" functional programming option and it's got a lot of documentation and quite a healthy community. I just need something that works :)

Thank you!",0

these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s.

so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked.

also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks.

2717,2718,"The Riot TR boards post referenced in this reddit post makes it clear that the issue with the lolskin software is that it enables player to use Riot skins that you normally pay for, for free.

This practice is called ""skin hacking"" or ""skin porting"" and is unanimously rejected by the modern custom skin community. At least, it is the case for VoXskins, the community I'm a part of.

The problem didn't ever stem from the ability to use custom, fan-made skins. Custom skins are something that Rioters actually find pretty cool, and modders are usually very involved players. There's always been a gray area and a tolerance towards us, and it is clear that custom skins haven't ever been a legitimate ban reason.

Any person that was banned because they used custom skins were banned because they installed their mods through a software that was bundled with other unfair features. This was the case with MKLoL / MKJogo, which added an unfair advantage through jungle timers (didn't exist in game at all back then). This is also the case with LoLskin: it isn't an unfair advantage but that software hurts Riot's business strongly by jeopardizing their main source of income. The widespread use of LoLskin is what pushed Riot to decide to make it bannable.

Nowadays, custom skins can be installed using clean software that was developed by members of the custom skins community, that aren't bundled with any features that could pose a problem with Riot's business or give an unfair advantage. The community closely pays attention to what is distributed so that we remain in the best terms with Riot possible.

TL;DR lolskin is bannable because it gave you free skins client-side, not because of custom skins",0

Meanwhile men have a laundry list of preferences, standards, and REQUIREMENTS for womens physical beauty. 

Some of their preferences are breast size/shape, nose size, WHR, hip width.

And the most common argument the short guys have is well you cant change height!! 1. You cant change the above things unless you are willing to risk your life, take time off from work and lose money, and drop >5k on implants or surgery, which guys shame you for anyways. 2. Why does it MATTER that you cant change your height? Ok? Should women immediately be sympathetic because you have an unfixable feature and start to have a preference for it? 

Its double standards. Im glad theres a feature for men to widespread be insecure about. Because women are picked apart and microscopically dissected for their features. Men dissect an oblivious woman walking by, with their friends as a social pastime. Its disgusting. 

Women, dont feel guilty for having a height preference. Men have just about every preference under the sun!",0
2723,2724,"Yeah the thing is lots of men want to be immune to rejection. So people saying women should give short men a chance make me wonder where is the parade of men telling other men ""dude you should give hairy chicks a chance! It's awesome!"" Or ""fat chicks are so soft bro it's heaven!"", or ""that chick has a big nose - hey that means she's a catch!"". 

Answer Is, no where, but women who are hairy or are chubby or have a big nose or whatever else thing men find unattractive have to ask for basic respect. Not attraction just respect. 

So go ahead and like tall guys. I say the same thing to them as they told me: ""people not finding you attractive isn't oppression"".",0

I agree, women really need to stop bending over backwards. I dont mind somewhat shorter men that I keep that to myself (the whole debacle is turning me off men shorter than me completely tbh but I'm a femcel so what I like doesn't matter lmao). All I say is that women are allowed to have preferences and it's the only thing I'll say.

I hear men going on and on about ""petite"" this and ""petite"" that. Blackpeopletwitter loves to make fun of ugly women but bring up short men in that thread and they get mad.

The infamous angry short man who claimed he couldn't get dates lied. He even recorded one of his many dates where he abandons a woman in the snow.

It's a power issue, they're have to accept that they're not rich Adonis' that all women lust over and get a hobby instead.

5'8-5'10 guys (literally.average heighted guys) whining about height is flat out pathetic. You're taller than most women so it's not your height mate.

Which is just... hypocrisy to no end.",0
2729,2730,"Maybe but women don't really have to make men like fat women like men have to make women like short men.

A fat woman can have a great face, skin, and just more tits and ass which pleases some men.

A short man is visually less of a man.  There is no male virtue that touts manletism.

This is why those men accepting fatter women is less of an effort and many of it do it themselves 

Men are not more virtuous for being willing to fuck anything

Women looking for men are not seeking just anything to fuck.  They are looking for long term

That is why this isnt a good comparison.

I feel like the body positivity movement is more women saying they don't deserve to be treated less than because men find them physically unappealing than saying guys *have* to date them.

2734,2735,"Sure. Vent. I dont care. But dont try to GUILT women into finding you attractive so you can get your dick wet. 

Go into any r/unpopularopinion post. We can even play Manlet Bingo or something. Take a shot every time a guy says, they are shallow you dodged a bullet says something about fat women you can lose weight but you cant gain height. These are clearly arguments trying to vouch for women to start being attracted to short men, or at least start questioning their preferences. They want women to see that height is unfixable so that women can feel bad and begin to date short men out of pity. 

Believe me. I was one of them. I started to look at my own mental processes and condition myself to find short men attractive. Not gonna do that. Men dont do the same when it comes to darker women, fat women, women with bad teeth, women with flat chests asses or no hips, etc. Im not going to do introspective psychology work to get head pats from short men and women shouldnt, either.",0

Personally I was amazed at the variety of reaction you can get and it's important to realize that at the end of the day, everyone around you is a human being, you can talk to them and however they react, as long as you are polite and well-intentioned, they are no reason to censor yourself. You can and will learn from every situation. I made a short video showcasing various kind of vibes and reactions, enjoy :)

Its easy to believe that they are better than you, and that they would never even think of being with someone like you because you are not attractive/intelligent/funny/wealthy/interesting enough.

2835,2836,"From an absolutely biased point of view: Yes, you should put time into it. Every characters story is engaging and incredible in all different kinds of ways, so if youre interested in that, its certainly a high point. The music will never leave your head once you hear it for the first time and youll listen to it over and over for so long. The gameplay is super fun, and Ive never had more fun losing to tough bosses on repeat. The game is easily 100+ hours and its worth every single second of it. Im sure itll make you happier, and I really hope this, if not another great game, helps you out!",0
2836,2837,"Your opinions on JRPGs may influence how much youll love Octopath, but I think its more telling that you said you wanted to take your mind off things and be happy. This is an excellent good mood game. The characters and visuals set a nice tone and the chapter format keeps a fun pace going.

The short story format feels less dense than your average RPG even though you can easily put 100+ hours in as a whole. I spent maybe 5 hours legitimately grinding through my entire playthrough, and I think the game is grindier in reputation than it is in practice.

This was one of my favorites from 2018, and Ive always felt it deserves a bigger following so Im quick to recommend it.",0

2886,2887,"The 5 pillars that made me full-filledThe 5 Pillars that made me a self made (and self full-filled) man.

:

When most people hear this they automatically think I mean a girlfriend, fianc or wife. While I think having a partner is important to being happy & full-filled it's not the only important relationship.

A solid relationship with family, high quality friends, and even a strong relationship with yourself are extremely important. The dynamics I've create in each of these have been the backbone to my success. Having people I can count on, people I can learn from and people who raise me up.

:

It took me longer than I'd like to admit to handle this area of my life. I was perfectly content just coasting by with little effort for a few too many years but I decided at some point that I wanted more from myself. My parents didn't work as hard as they did for me to make an average income. Being financially free has allowed me to not only re invest into myself and my business, but also eat where I want, stay where I want, travel where I want and buy what I want. Life isn't only about working hard but also enjoying the fruits of your efforts.

:

Split into 3 parts:

Garbage in = garbage out. I used to love shake shack. If I could have it more than once a week, it would be a no brainer. Problem is I was always tired, slow and lethargic. I would need naps just to get through a day. As soon as I started to care a little more as to what I put in, I had more energy than ever before, and I stopped getting sick. Now? I can't even stomach a shake shack burger even if I tried!

Working out and getting in shape. While I'm no bodybuilder, I'm always working to improve my body and take care of myself physically. If I look good, I feel good.

Rest.

For some reason we've all been sold on the ""KEEP GOING TILL YOU DIE"" mentality. We forget how important rest is for the body, for the mind, for ourselves in general. If you don't take some time to rest your body will force you to do so. (I was so overworked last year that I collapsed in an elevator and smashed my head due to this 'keep going no rest' mentality, wasn't fun)

:
Educating yourself on a continuous basis. Reading books, meditating, learning how to be in control of your emotions when need be (not over reacting) but also being able to express them and experience them when need be. Your mind is capable of more than you give it credit for. If you take care of it, it will take care of you.

      :

Being able to drop your ego and being able to say ""I don't know how to do this, maybe someone can help?""

For a large majority of my life, I held myself back because I was too proud to ask for help. I kept telling myself that I'll figure it out somehow. With that attitude my progress came to a stand still. For years I was lying to myself, till I finally said ok maybe I can use some help. As soon as I did that, every area above accelerated. I had momentum and success in more areas than one and I was able to achieve things I previously could only dream of. Sure I had to invest money to do so, but the trade off vs the results I achieved was a no brainer.

There are people out there willing to help you, you just need to reach out and ask.

Hope this helps

2887,2888,Could you be elaborate on how you became more financially independent?,0
2888,2889,"1. Start with a good monthly/yearly budget and understanding of your spendings/incomes. Use a spreadsheet.
2. Create a plan on how much you need to support the lifestyle your want including hobbies, travels, etc...
3. Make sure you make a bit of money every month that you can put on the side. Stop spending money on useless shit.
4. With that money left, pay your bad debts if you have any.
5. Create a security fund and retirement fund. The COVID situation give you the perfect example on why you need a security fund.

After like 3 months, I  started to realise that sometimes people scare that im holding eye contact and in that moments I felt creepy . Idk maybe i misinterpreted their body language maybe they were not scared but still sometimes that happens and I feel creepy occasionally if that happens.

 I want to ask that if there is anyone felt in a same way before or is it just me that being delusional?

Also is there any gesture or special way of eye contact or something that I can do during conversation to prevent this being creepy vibe? 

Thanks for the opinions.",0
3001,3002,"During the prolonged eye contact, what are you thinking? And what are you feeling?

Your facial expression is important when holding eye contact, and a lot of us may not be aware of what our face is doing!

Be careful that you dont appear too intense... or look like youre looking for a fight!

If during extended eye contact, you are thinking positive thoughts about yourself and the other person and the moment youre in, this can help your facial expression, physiology (e.g. how slow and relaxed your eye blinking is) and your eye contact seem warm, welcoming, and relaxed.",0

3003,3004,"In everything in game, besides holding frame, even in which in rare times it must be broken for comfort reasons, you must utilize it as push pull. Eye contact is to create tension, to project energy, mindset, focus. In pick up we use what we call laser eye contact. 

1. Forehead relaxed

2. Eyes low like someone shined a light in it, or you just woke up

3. Barely able to tell that your eyes are open, but enough  to know you definitely are alive

4. Focused on a singular point. A point within that point. Like staring at the eye of a needle. Then trying to find the middle of the eye of that needle. That's what makes it laser

5. You project what you're thinking in your mind through your eyes. If you feel it genuinely, your eyes will assume it

5a. Relaxed, yet loose and solid. Like how you lightly pull a rubberband apart and when you snap it it returns to position. It didn't have to do anything to do that. It simply was.

Strong eye contact implies many things. Dominance. Confidence. Ability to be present in the moment and be relaxed. Lack of fear. But it can also project the desire to be violent. A predator never takes its eyes off its prey. You however know she is not prey. 

You hold eye contact just long enough to communicate the right things, then break it. Like you break for natural pauses in conversation. Push pull. Good feelings, then take it away. The tension comes from them wondering and wanting the good feelings back. 

There isn't a magic formula for when to pull back. You have to feel your way into it and be empathetic.",0

So what he was asking was if women fart periodically every 5-15 minutes during ovulation so it would be acceptable if the ovulating woman was to have sex.

According to him all he knows about ovulation is women are more likely to get pregnant and they are gassy.

Edit: I should elaborate, I agree with him about women possibly having stomach issues when ovulating, thats what I was discussing with my friends when he interrupted. Its the perfectly timed farting that makes no sense.",0

3078,3079,"Today Was a Bad Day, and I'm Glad It WasJust want to share a young fella's small epiphany. As simple as it is, it will help me stay on track in the times we're living in.

**Take responsibility for your little prison of flesh and everything else will fall into place.** 

Today was the first day of this pandemic that I felt like it wasn't going to be easy.

In the rare occasions I feel down I tend to think ""Welp that's it, I feel like shit and I have no control over the situation so I guess I'll just feel shit until I don't.""

I know, fkn helpful huh.

Thankfully I've been working on this and a lot more. So after a long day of things just not going my way and my overall state of mind not helping I recognised it was time for a good ol' meditation. I have found that taking a breather can go a long way.

So there I am all zen and shit when I allow my mind to wander a little so I can figure my shit out.

I asked myself what might be one of the oldest questions: Why am I not happy right now?

Well idk I've been taking care of myself. A couple weeks ago I started taking workouts far more seriously (thanks TRP) and doing some yoga too. But hmm now that I think about it such a change in lifestyle can temporarily make you feel drained of energy. I have also been eating well than before BUT HMM now that I think about it I skipped a few meals in the last couple days. And I did (make a conscious decision to) relapse from NoFap today. And yadayadayada

Huh, it makes a whole lotta sense my brain isn't giving me happy chemicals, even tho just a few days ago I was thriving in almost the same routine. I've been on autopilot, haven't I?

So I considered all my past experiences on this contentment subject and looked for the exact things I haven't been doing.

Surprise surprise, it was nothing I didn't already know subconsciously. And yet I had it so perfectly laid out in front of me that I wrote it down and stuck it in the window in front of my desk. Call it a dogma for contentment:

&#x200B;

>**Only by letting go of vices, practicing good habits, and looking after our mind and body,**  
>  
>**we can expect to appreciate life and know what we need**

&#x200B;

""But a disciplined life without dopamine seems so boring!""

You'll be surprised to find how fulfilling it becomes. Not only it's far easier to find contentment, but you also know what you want in order to be happy. 

More specifically, you are more aware of what your body and brain need in order to stay tf out of your way.

Let me break down my experience:

1. **Let go of vices** \- I was doing NoFap and getting laid consistently so I had to make a smooth transition. Space out masturbation and don't fall into porn. Weed (which is everywhere in my social circles) also tends to make me lazy and can get me down. Social media, youtube videos with no valuable content yadayada. 
2.  **Good habits and looking after yourself** \- Exercise, yoga, meditation, staying in touch with people, watching a few sunsets and adding variety to the day through a hobby.
3. **Appreciate Life** \- The day goes by faster, you enjoy the simple things, you feel fulfilled and in the right course.
4.  **Know what you need** \- By going off autopilot and cultivating mindfulness you don't fall back into old habits and you notice what you need as soon as that need arises.

Thank you for reading. Honestly, I wrote this more for myself. My state of mind can be quite volatile, which probably isn't the case for most fellas. But I hope it helps someone. Also if there's any grammar mistakes or incongruencies: English ain't my first language.

It says:

*How do we not lose hope in finding love? How do you tell yourself that the right guy will come along when you don't really believe it? Why do you not believe that it could happen for you? Regardless of the insanity that we see out there today, love happens. People get married. People move in together. These things happen all the time. You don't have to be young, or beautiful, \[rich, famous\], in shape, enough to offer, or have a good credit score. If love happens for this one or for that one then it is possible for me. Whatever we have lived up to in our past, it does not indicate our future. You may want to revisit choices that you dismissed in the past.*

In the comments below the video, you can find an excerpt from the the despair of women over 25 (and certainly over 30):

*Im 46 years old and it has never happened for me.*

*Its really hard to believe love can happen for me when I have been waiting for so long. Its been 12 years since my divorce, and I am losing hope.*

*It has been 20 years since my divorce.  I've been with several dating agencies, and only had a couple of short - term relationships which have never lasted beyond a few weeks/months.  Just one that lasted about 15 months, but he turned out to be an alcoholic.  I've had a couple of dates just recently, but all he wanted was a friend ""with benefits"" .  I will be 70 this year so just want someone who will prove his worth before anything like that happens.  I'm not as confident about my body, as I was years ago.*

*Im a very affectionate caring loving women aged 35 , men tell me Im attractive all the time.  But I meet a guy we start to date , we get on great he says hes so crazy about me & finds me so attractive & caring and with in a few weeks( longest being 6 mths )the man says he doesnt want commitment & has no feelings for me . This has happen to me about 20 times over the past 15 years. So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it.*

*Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?*

I think that the lesson for women is quite simple.

Either they find a husband while still in their prime age, or else, they will soon end up in a desperate situation.

Of course, that does not change anything on the male side, which first and foremost may want to stay away from the gynocentric court system. So, if a woman is young and pretty, she may still be able convince a younger man, who at that point is still governed by his hormones, to ignore his red-pill lessons and sign up anyway, for a stint on the plantation. Older women are mostly toast, while the video tries to give them hope that they are not (but they do not seem to believe it, really).",0

3102,3103,I mean if only the 30 yr old lowered her standards a bit she would find hordes of men who want a relationship. And possibly even the 35yr old one. What was the 70yr old thinking when she divorced at 50 though?,0

I'd love to discuss this situation because I don't see it being talked about enough. I really would like to hear from feminists on this issue, especially how it relates to: Greater feminist discourse, #Metoo as well as things like how it relates other hashtag movements such as #believe all women, etc. In my opinion this situation flies in the face of all of that and proves a major point made by the MHRM: That women when they want to victimize men can simply falsify accusations and society by large *will* #believe all women.

Especially the feminists considering this particular situation. In addition this situation highlights the real affect modern feminism has had on gender equality. In this situation, we have identified a victim of years long abuse, one where the perp has manipulated society at large and even spoke at the women's march. And now that the truth has come to light, feminism and the media are silent. And it's because it provides evidence of the fallacy of feminism and is an example of all the criticisms of the MRM/Anti Fem movement. And that can't be abided.

Also to the people who make the argument ""Feminism isn't that powerful of a movement"" uhhh an almost complete media blackout on the TRUTH would suggest otherwise. Damn even Andrew Yang didn't get done this dirty.",0

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

&#x200B;

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair.

[Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

&#x200B;

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse!

3133,3134,"One thing you have to know is that there is a fundamental flaw in this question - ""What do women want?""

The flaw is this -- Every single man who ever asked this question is operating in a woman's frame, with her as the goddess whom he's trying to learn to please. And as we know, women don't have much of a frame at all. That is the source of the confusion. 

As for the much more useful question ""Who am I, the man?"", it never occurs to the average man to ask himself that, let alone answer it. His self awareness is limited to the knowledge that he's got a dick that has begun to work for more than just pissing, that his heart rate is a little higher and maybe his navel's tingling. I doubt if the thought even arose that yes, he is indeed a man... 

Which doesn't help him have a frame of a man in the least, let alone a life worthy of a man. 

It takes men a long way down the road to realize that even if they are doing everything else right, they are still not operating in their frame yet, but trying to find hers. That is more subtle stuff, not as easy to spot as skin and bones or a pot belly, or that you don't even know how to talk to a girl -- but it's the root of the problem. It takes even more experience to learn all the ways in which we're still subconsciously doing it.

I agree with these claims several time, and it's very likely that there is an ""empathy"" gap where women get support or understanding and men don't.

For example :  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5xt2c/my_girlfriend_wont_let_me_finish_in_her_mouth/) is about a guy whose GF won't give him a blowjob (or won't let him finish in her mouth, the post is unclear) and almost everybody just tell him to deal with it and stop wanting it.

3162,3163,"TRP Perpetuates ""hypergamy"" on its ownJust found this sub, so I hope it's ok to post this here, but I just wanted to offer a perspective for discussion that's been bothering me:

I'm a woman who's been fortunate to find success in her career, so I end up having a significantly higher income than a lot of men I meet. This isn't something that really concerns me. The way I see it, if we get married, my money becomes *our* money so it doesn't matter in the end as long as my partner can support himself and shares my financial values. However, what I discovered over and over again in the dating pool was that men themselves seemed to have more of an issue with it than I did. 

What was most hurtful was when I would begin seriously dating someone only to discover they felt insecure and resentful about it further down the road. They didn't like their girlfriend picking up the tab for things. They felt stupid waiting for me at home while I worked long hours. They didn't want to play ""second fiddle"" to their girlfriend as they saw it and have my career be the one dictating our living situation. These things hurt their pride and made them feel emasculated.

I don't believe every man is like this. But isn't this how TRP would have men act? The brand of destructive masculinity TRP touts would have you believe that all these things ARE inherently emasculating and negative. Would they allow their girlfriend or wife to have a career that comes up against theirs or be the primary breadwinner in their household? My sense is no.

So what is the end result here? If that's the case, I'm effectively forced into giving up my lucrative career at my partner's behest, or only dating men who equally or more successful than I am who won't feel threatened by me. So wouldn't RP ideology force me into ""hypergamy"" on its own?",0

Anyone here has book recommendations or practical applications on how to improve conversation skills in RPW context (I feel like conversing as a businesswoman is very different) and on how to regulate emotions?

Struggling with these two aspects a lot - its the last two things on my list to work on for my current self improvement journey. 

For conversation, I struggle with putting on a social mask, so to speak. Social niceties and sounding open/warm drain me a lot, because my character tends to be more calm, straightforward and logical, even serious. When Im not mentally prepared to make small talk, sometimes I get nervous and dont know how to reply, unless there is a point to the conversation (eg. we are meeting to discuss X, for example) or it is a genuinely interesting discussion without the social niceties filter.

I worry sometimes that I may be good for stimulating discussions, but may not be warm/affirmative enough. How can I present myself as warm in a conversation, without having to act bubbly? (I do feel warm and open to listening, Im just not sure that Im coming off that way!). I also have a very low threshold for bullshit, and many times conversations seem to involve white lies, feigned interest, bullshitting, which make it tiring. Is this a perspective problem that I have or is this something everyone just does out of practice?

This area in life has confused me so much. I would rather I have a more natural strategy too because I dont think I can keep up an act for the rest of my life. My MBTI is INTJ because it may explain some things.

My goal = be a better *female* friend to my female friends (not just a *masculine* friend), and a soft place to land for my future partner



Also struggling with regulating my emotions, I tend to change moods very quickly and dwell on the past/future a lot, and although there are no major mental health concerns, I would like to feel more stable/in tune and in control of my emotions. Stronger. I cant go to therapy at the moment because I pumped my money into fitness/feminine goals. Can anyone recommend some books?

Any other self improvement suggestions for soft skills also very much welcome. Hope everyone is safe and healthy in this climate!",0

Shift your focus from abstract ideas to placating to people. When you're talking to someone, always think about their emotions first more than whatever it is you're trying to convey.

3189,3190,"I used to struggle with this a lot when I was younger. In conversations, I was always in my own head. I focused on my own thoughts and impressions more than anything else. That approach is great for a lecture but terrible for a conversation.

Think about someone youve met who you really enjoy interacting with, who makes you feel good. Im not talking about someone who provides good mental stimulation or debates with you. I specifically want you to think about someone who makes you feel comfortable opening up and discussing anything.

That is a good conversationalist. That is the goal when socializing. Its not to be interesting or funny or the center of attention. Its to make whoever you are speaking to feel comfortable and special.

To be a great conversationalist, you have to shift your focus from your inner thoughts to others outward feelings. Doing so isnt easy and takes some practice, but its absolutely a skill you can develop. 

As another person suggested, the YouTube channel Charisma on Command is EXCELLENT. It helped me hone a lot of the little skills that add up to being a better conversationalist.

For example, one piece of her advice is to never give a ""naked"" answer to a question. If you're asked where you are from, instead of saying, ""I am from Aspen, Colorado"", you clothe the answer with a relevant comment-- you might say, ""I am from Aspen, Colorado, but I can't ski for my life"".

I have a girlfriend, we met about half a year ago, wintertime, during ice-skating, I just saw her and noticed that she is hanging out by herself, so I came and propose to glide together, after that I said that she might add my phone to her phonebook, so we can spend some time together someday, the same night she texted me.

&#x200B;

We were calling eachother for a while, hang out and stuff, untill we kissed and then our hanging became dating, everything was alright... 

&#x200B;

Then after a month or so, I start trying the Rational Male arsenal on her, and then... everything went wrong. No connection, no laughing, no easy conversation and stuff, at some point she said that I changed, that something is wrong with me, that self-isolation shit killed our spark completely(we didn't meet in person for two weeks or so and the worst part is that I am not really want to see her at the time), meaning that we can't just have an easy smooth phone conversation(I hate talking over the phone btw) it ends up by misunderstanding and her's hanging up(I have some thought that this misunderstanding maybe made up by her, so I can feel guilt for not carrying it properly), then it was kinda time when she didn't call me, and I didn't call her, like who is gonna last in this silent battle, I lost, I called her(cuz I felt like it is my fault) she didn't answer, then she eventually answer and we had a conversation where I reveal the truth, like ""Baby, I am not want to do it with you, I am just trying to follow the rules of game"" she asked me what game, then I opened completely about my behavior and stuff, now I don't know if we break up or not, probably yes(and I know about Iron Rule #7 ofc).

Well... yes. Things tend to go wrong if you treat a woman who has any semblance of self-respect based on redpill rules. Redpill is emotionally abusive and mostly succeeds with vulnerable people, if you try it with someone who has self-esteem, it's not gonna end very well for you. Whatever you were doing until that point was clearly working, why on Earth did you try to ""start trying your arsenal on her""? A relationship is not a war. If it is, you should break up.

Don't have ""silent battles"" with people you love. It doesn't end well. Again, if you tried to force the redpill crap on her, she probably had a good reason to be frustrated with you.

Stop caring about what the ""Iron Rules"" say and start thinking for yourself. You two had something good, then you started playing games with her, which she didn't appreciate. Do not rely on dogma. Also, do you actually believe Rule 6? 

I obviously can't tell if you've ruined everything already, but if you're willing to admit that you were wrong to play games, you still might have a chance.

3207,3208,"The way the concept of a patriarchy is abused genuinely scares me.
Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that ""Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world"" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment. 

You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world. There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues. 

The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.

The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.

I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.",0

This is very true. I left academia after my PhD, and that was in hard sciences. But I could see how people are holding onto research themes that make no sense, just because they get funding for it. If they were funded by private corporations, they would long have been gone.   


The word kafkaesque you used is spot on. What has been human's strength since the dawn of  ages is the collaboration between more pragmatic, ambitious, cold-blooded, rational man and the more intuitive, maternal, empathic, emotional and less rational woman. Each trait on each gender can be seen as positive or negative, but they each contribute to a certain balance.  


Starting to say that not just knowledge, but in fact the whole rational scientific method are 'oppressive', is one of the most self-destructive ideas that our society could have.

Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that ""Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world"" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment.
>
>You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world.

Have you ever actually listened to a feminist? No offense, but this reads like your only interactions with feminists come from Ben Shapiro reks feminists!!! or twitter screenshots of crazy people. Most feminists are rational people so if someone shows you a feminist argument that makes no sense on its face then you should be skeptical that theyre not making a straw man. 

For starters, knowledge isnt oppressive, that obviously makes no sense. Second, feminists dont actually believe in a male Illuminati, patriarchy is more of a social order, which leads into the next point, its not designed to be unfalsifiable its just nebulous. Similarly, socialism is where the workers own the means of production right? What percent of corporations would have to become co-ops before were not capitalist anymore? That doesnt mean capitalism and socialism are unfalsifiable, the line is just blurry. For patriarchy, theres not a hard line for what is and isnt, its more of the sum of social interactions that trend a certain way, like women being pressured to start a family instead of focusing on their career. 

> There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues.

>Sociocultural

Like...a system where women are pushed into a homemaker role and men are pushed into a breadwinner role? Like...patriarchy?

>The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.

>The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.

This is a strange point because you can apply this logic to basically anything. Is religion not a belief system because you can make a career out of theology? If you work at a nonprofit because you believe in their mission does that make it not a belief of yours? Nowadays both left wing and right wing people can make a career out of arguing their political beliefs on YouTube, does that make it not a belief anymore? Also, can you honestly say women arent pressured into homemaking anymore? Thats the original reason behind the movements in the 60s and 70s so while progress has definitely been made, why do you think there isnt oppression anymore?

>I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.

3231,3232,"I think men and women are far more similar than both MRAs and Feminists portrayI see a lot of posts explaining how men and women are so different and so thats why its so difficult for them to understand each other. I think men and women have very few fundamental differences. Yes, physically they have differences, like men tend to be taller and larger etc. But psychologically (Im not an expert so I could be wrong) there dont seem to be a huge amount of big differences. The idea that men are more logical and less emotional is lost on me, because I am a very emotional person, and so is my father. My mother on the other hand is logical and very unemotional. I know this is anecdotal, but I dont think it is uncommon.",0
3232,3233,"Greater variability as an evolutionary trait is a huge one. Basically for a number of stats, men are more varied then women. This shows up often in very high achieving careers as more men will have those traits due to the distribution.


In terms of overal performance it means men will make up a greater proportion of the top and bottom of most brackets. More CEOs and more homeless in practical terms.

Also there are psychological differences that derive from biology. A man who is tall and strong might walk through that dark construction site home at night without fear and a woman might not. The risk taking and the feeling of fear these feel and experience might be the result of biology even if exposed to a similar or the same environment. Its not so easy to say that there are just physical differences when those physical differences amplify in part our behavior. Etc.",0
3233,3234,"True, I hadnt thought about how much the physical aspect impacts the psychological differences. Thats interesting. Thanks for the input. 

I think mostly what Ive had a bit of an issue with is that a lot of MRAs and Feminists talk about the poner gender as if they are the other and almost the enemy. They almost group all men or all women together as if they all have the same thoughts and traits.",0
3234,3235,"The problem is that we also influence each other. How would women be different if women stayed the same but the paired sex was smaller and weaker. Suddenly that smaller and weaker sex might value completely different traits and women might develop differently. 

Lots of our understanding of sex differences has to do with comparison to the other. You cant just remove it and consider one sex in a vaccuum because that is not how a dimorphic species like humanity develops.

Men and women have different thoughts and traits purely by coexisting with the other.",0
3235,3236,"It's trends in behaviour. You're right that the similarities far outweigh the differences but the differences can have an impact in aggregate. It's not a one size fits all but they do have an impact. At least, this is my understanding. The major differences come into play at the extremes of the deviation with some being more prominent than others. For example, interest in things vs people.

I'd agree that the perception of difference is greater than the differences themselves but your main argument is a bit of a Strawman against Feminists and MRAs to be honest. Feminism thinks the differences are small but socialisation makes men more violent on average (to use an example) and MRAs think socialisation and biology have an impact on behaviours but also that the negative traits of men are over reported and negative traits in women are under reported (and vice versa with positive traits). Your argument doesn't really tackle either of these.",0

*""The Distance Between Mars and Venus: Measuring Global Sex Differences in Personality""*. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029265

In particular, women are far more sensitive and ""easily offended"" than men are, which probably goes a long way towards explaining the stereotype about women being more emotional than men.

It's hard to tell if this is biological or social but in the real world these differences are pretty pronounced.",0
3238,3239,"I would say that claiming men and women are the same/very similar is a very feminist view. Feminists have been arguing for the last century against neurosexism, which is the view that there are distinct differences between the male and female brain- see Cordelia Fine Delusions of Gender and the book Im currently reading by Gina Rippon, called The Gendered Brain. She systematically identifies and disproves myths such as the greater male variability hypothesis and the idea that women and men are psychologically different. 

It just seems to me like the whole history of the feminist movement is made up of feminists saying were just like men, we can do ___ just as well and for __ insert things like being a leader, being educated. Feminists have been trying to prove that men and women are equal for decades.",0
3239,3240,"There is a double standard here though.

I've been arguing for a while that if men and women really are more similar than different, that women are just as capable of violence and abusive behaviors as men, including rape.

I use this rhetoric a lot when talking to feminists specifically.

*""Why is this the only issue where you think men are different?""*

The problem ultimately comes down to them only ever caring about gender stereotypes when they negatively effect women, while at the same time amplifying negative stereotypes about men (I guess to make women look better?).

The result is that they end up perpetuating the same antiquated, Victorian style gender norms that they claim to be against.",0

I think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal. It's FAR from universal.

3269,3270,"I am so thankful you have created a sub! I dont adore the name however. I feel like mistress is something that is inherently connected to a man, and not in a positive way? I want the sub to be geared toward encouraging women to step away from degeneracy and work toward their personal growth goals. One problem I think women struggle with is seeking validation from others on social media, how we can aim to feel content and fufilled without external sources. And discussing problems like that and how to solve it. What do you think?",0

**mistress**

*/mstrs/*

noun

1. a woman in a position of authority or control.

*""she is alwaysmistress ofthe situation, coolly self-possessed""*

And I think, since it was your idea, you should be a mod to this sub. I will follow you on Reddit then send you an invite.",0
3271,3272,"I disagree that mistress is only used in connection to a man. It's the feminine version of master. It certainly has other definitions, but it's not inherently referential to men.",0
3272,3273,"Thank you for your support.Thank you all for the lovely messages Ive gotten over the past couple days. 

Everything has been such a blur family and friend and people from the community who my husband and father impacted. My father trained the rabbi who gave his service. My husbands students carried his coffin. Ive gotten so many letters and phone calls just sharing what my father and husband did for the people of our community. I never realized what sort of pillars in the community they were . 

My father was a rabbi for 40 years so the number of weddings, funeral, bris, mitzvahs is probably uncountable. The time he spent counseling is immeasurable. Theres probably no way to measure my fathers impact. 

My husband ran a book store and taught at the Yeshiva and was super active in the community. My husband was always there when someone needed him and gave deeply and frequently. 

Thats what I want my children to know their father and grandfather as. Caring and giving people who made the world better.

Im slowly getting used to a new normal without my husband. My whole routine is shifted without him. Im trying to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. Ive been trying to keep for crying in front of them. But I keep breaking down. Im not strong and this hard and terrifying and painful. I dont see another side to this.",0
3273,3274,May their memories be for a blessing. Im so sorry.,0

3275,3276,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

3279,3280,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside.

NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

3283,3284,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself?

3287,3288,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin.

3310,3311,"What is your opinion on John Stoltenberg's view that masculinity and femininity are artificially created concepts that should be abandoned entirely? He also believes that masculinity as a concept is inherently toxic (I'll get into the details below, he did an interview where he explains why)In case you didn't know, he describes himself as a radical feminist. He did an interview with Vice.com where he goes into more detail on his views on this topic, but I think I can summarize them pretty well in this post. [Here's his full interview with Vice if you to know his view on this issue in greater detail](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/zmk3ej/all-masculinity-is-toxic&ved=2ahUKEwjbmcu_5fnoAhXDTN8KHQ12B80QFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1cB20RqEciXqCreKtu6mEY&ampcf=1). I recommend reading it.

Basically his argument is that traits and qualities associated with masculinity or femininity are just human qualities that any individual might have, man or woman. Men can be shy, quiet, emphatic, etc. and women can be violent, aggressive, prideful, etc. John think's it's unfair that some of these qualities are associated heavily with one gender or the other, and that qualities such as empathy and kindness are universal human qualities that should not be genderized or viewed as feminine. Likewise, women can be violent too, and as such violence should not be viewed as solely masculine. All these traits should just be viewed as human traits. I pretty much agree with this point of view.

However, he argues that the main thing that distinguishes masculinity and femininity (as social concepts/ideas/roles) is that masculinity promotes violence and aggression, while femininity does not. As such, he argues that masculinity as a social concept is inherently toxic, because masculinity promotes harmful behaviors that femininity doesn't promote. Even though he believes that toxic behaviors like violence and aggression are not inherent qualities of men or women, he believes that that traits and behaviors promoted by masculinity are generally more toxic than those promoted by femininity. Still, he thinks masculinity and femininity as concepts should be done away with.

Thoughts? I recommend reading the interview with Vice.",0

3312,3313,"I would disagree with you & agree with Stoltenberg. Masculinity & femininity are made up ideas intended to associate a particular style of being with a gender identity - and then used to reward or punish people for how they act.

3314,3315,"Very good interview/article. This is an idea I've been discussing with others a lot lately; that of qualities being genderless.

""If someone is transitioning from male to a trans woman, it is the core self that makes the passage from one vessel to the next. Our character is divorced from our gender."" I think this sums up a lot. It's never made sense to me to designate and categorize human traits; after all, anyone can and does possess any quality, with any gender.

Where does this leave masculinity and femininity? As mere concepts and ideas that have been associated with sex. Any culture can make up a set of ideas that are ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" to their particular social structure. Releasing the need to live up to social standards and ideas about gender frees one to live truer to their human self, their most moral ideal.

Edit: r/menslib often discusses this very topic with much intelligence. If you don't follow them, do!",0
3315,3316,I think masculinity and femininity are fine as long as it is recognized that people of all sexes have both inside them.,0

3317,3318,"Gender identity ast it's core is no different to any other identity. It's a set of characteristics that are chosen to express oneself. Of course there is a lot of social conditioning invloved so one can argue if it is a conscious choice but no one is born masculine or feminine in the same way no one is born a punk or a lover of musicals.

Gender identity can be problematic for two reasons. One, due to the huge discrimination people face for what is or isn't hanging between their legs, and the fact that gender identity is often tied up with that, means it's not as trivial as identifying a punk for example. Two because of the aforementioned discrimination gender identity can often be empowering.

So while I disagree with gender entirely and think it's complete bullshit. I won't ever call someone out for having one. I'm saying this as a white hetronormative cis gendered male. So I can't ever really know the empowerment a gender identity might bring. My identity has never been under attack.

My point is the above commentor is saying there is nothing wrong with saying bodybuilding is masculine or knitting is feminine as long as recognise a man or woman can do either and don't pigeonhole people. But of course they are free to correct me if I got the wrong end of the stick.",0
3318,3319,"I like Stoltenberg's ideas a lot. (And in his favor, he's trans-inclusive, which is somewhat rare for a radical feminist.) From what I understand, he's sort of saying that, like whiteness, maleness is inherently defined in opposition to an oppressed other. He's not saying that every trait seen as masculine is toxic, but rather that the need to feel secure in a constructed male identity leads to devaluation of women, and that traits should be evaluated by the standard of what makes a good person rather than what makes a good man or woman.

Edit: I do describe myself as a masculine person, but that has nothing to do with seeing myself as male (I'm a cis woman). It's more a description of how people perceive me based on my appearance and mannerisms. I don't think it's contradictory to want to do away with assigning different traits to different genders while also acknowledging that in our current society, people still perceive those traits as gendered.",0

3322,3323,"Boyfriend [30M] is accusing me [29F] of riding the cock carouselThis is a throwaway account since my boyfriend knows my main Reddit account and I dont want him stumbling upon this post

To give some info, I [29F] have been with my boyfriend [30M] in the relationship phase for around 5 months now. We were in the dating phase for around 3 months before he asked me if I was interested in becoming a couple (relationship). I was initially surprised since I felt it was a bit soon for me, but I did (do) like him a lot and thought why not give it a shot and see what happens.

I feel that our chemistry has been very similar to the dating phase to the relationship phase, other than the fact we are dealing with lockdowns right now (like most people around the world). I like him a lot! I really do. But, I have noticed over the last month or so of talking with me, he brings up a lot of interesting topics around me. Last weekend when we were together, we ended up having this conversation where he was saying; *You were riding the cock carousel before you met me.* - things like that.

I did figure out in the dating phase that he liked the YouTuber, Entrepreneurs in Cars, since we talked about a couple of videos that Rich Cooper posted (he likes him). One of the reasons I like my boyfriend a lot is because I feel we can talk about pretty much anything and have good discussions. Im always trying to be the feminine addition to his life and compliment him on his journey. However, I dont like him accusing me of things like riding the cock carousel, or even when he mentioned me possibly monkey branching on him for another guy.

The last few times these comments have come up, it has bothered me quite a bit because I like him a ton. I dont like him accusing me of things that are not true (i.e. I havent rode the CC). Im looking for advice on how to approach this topic if/when it comes up again. For some reason, I feel like it will come up again at a later date and I would like to shut it down completely. Any thoughts or advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated!

I'm not sure why or how they are expecting straight men to stop talking about what they find attractive in the opposite sex. 

Women are quite unapologetic about their preferences and will often let you know about their minimum height requirements ( which tend to be stricter and less flexible than men's preferences). how they like men with facial hair ( 1/4 men can't grow a beard ), their ideal penis size, etc.. Anyone who has been on dating apps knows how "" in your face "" women can be when [talking about a man's physique](https://i.redd.it/rsqzruu8axk21.jpg). Men's feelings aren't really taken into consideration here. You're just supposed to come to terms with your physical image and draw your self-esteem from somewhere else. 

Men, on the other hand, are expected to play by a different set of rules. You have to bite your tongue when talking about your ideal weight or any other feature that you find attractive. Anything you say can be interpreted as "" putting pressure on women""  or "" perpetuating an unrealistic standard of beauty "".

Why is there a need to coddle women and protect them from how men view them? where is that same concern for men who drew the short straw in the looks department? Isn't the subtext a bit sexist? like men should be able to handle it but women can't?",1

For ex: A girl expects me to be in touch with her constantly. We can't be meeting all the time. She expects that we are in touch with each other constantly either through call or text. So, I'd say I'm busy or I'd say normally I don't text so much but rather I'd like to meet in person instead. Somehow, she ignores this and keeps texting me. Now if I do respond to her everytime she texts me, I'd be texting all day long and eventually I'll come across as low value. On the other hand if I don't reply or take a long time to reply, it'll come across as disinterest or arrogance and she may auto-reject or go find someone who can cater to her needs. If I like the girl, I'll be losing her either way. How do I balance this?

If she doesnt answer or respond just leave a message to say you were thinking of her and would have liked to connect. And youll be available until x or available again at z.

If you lose the girl because she liked texting more than you then (1) you dodged a bullet because she might have been using you for attention, or (2) you both dodged a bullet because you two expect to be using texting in a different way in a relationship

Men who are extremely needy assume that, to be not needy, you should be the polar opposite - completely disinterested. In truth, it's about striking a balance by having clear boundaries you don't cross. Highly recommend you read the book if you struggle with needy behavior. 

To apply this to your example. The girl who wants you to be in touch constantly is playing on your neediness. You obey her because you desperately want your needs met, but it's actually hurting you. You appear low value because you're too available. 

Nothing else more important is taking up your time? No job? No gym? No hobby? No friends? That subcommunicates that she's more important than anything else going on in your life. Not what she's looking for. 

A boundary you can set is that you won't placate women who demand your attention. She can learn to deal with you being unavailable or she can find someone else to annoy.

Ive read all the recommended books here. Ive studied seduction and attraction for years. Ive read the sidebar. At this point I feel that Ive got an information overload and that it has fucked my brain up, honestly.

I am 24 and have had sex with 13 girls. Im currently on a 2 year dry spell.

Heres a breakdown of where I met the women Ive fucked:

 **School**: 3

 **Tinder**: 6

 **Work**: 4

I am not in school now. Tinder doesnt work for me anymore. My current job has no attractive females.

I am a decent looking dude and understand the many concepts of seduction and attraction. However, with the only three areas that Ive had success with women out of the picture, Ive got no clue where to meet women to end this dry spell.

Im not depressed about it or anything, I actually really value my time alone. I just think its time to smash some walls or maybe put myself into a position to have a selection of girls that I can choose from to have a intimate relationship with.

I don't know why it is that men think just because you have a good job, average in physical appearance and understand some strategy that they should be able to hook up with a woman. It doesn't work like this.. 

Would you date a women who was a 2 in looks but had a great job? Why would a woman want to do that then?...  

You likely have adequate exposure already, it's just that women don't seem to be drawn to you. No psychological strategy is going to work here.

I notice a lot of young women who call themselves ""alpha widowed"" tend to bring up later that they have mental health issues too.

Some reasons good men might not catch your eye...

-You might have ""intimacy fears"" that stop you from genuinely connecting with people in a healthy way. 

-You might have low self esteem issues that cause you to accept the love you think you deserve (unfulfilling) rather than the love you desire (fulfilling).

-You might have an ""attachment style"" that creates bad dynamics. 

-You grew up in an unhealthy environment and haven't resolved issues from childhood. Often we can confuse what feels familiar with what is attractive. Until you address your issues so that your body registers that familiarity as a red flag, this can make balanced and healthy people unappetizing. 

If any of this sounds familiar, therapy can be a huge help.

Youre attracted to a guy at the top of some hierarchy, or at least who presents honest signals of being there. This is why psychopaths are attractive, bad boys, the best at sport, celebrities, confident frame-controller, etc.

Men do not start at the top of the dominance hierarchy, they work for it.
Unlike the past, men have a good chance at getting there without being murdered or put in their place by those already at the top. Sort of more fair, where hard work is more likely to pay off at the very least.

So, you dont need to aim for guys already at the top (or at the best youve ever had and expect you can get), which is some consolation. Since you can invest in a guy and he can get there after the fact. Yeah it sucks that you cant just wait at the finish line. But, you can make a difference to a mans life and allow him the frame, be feminine for him and allow him to maintain and steadily grow into a more ideal man which benefits you and him. Not manipulation, but simply being feminine brings out qualities for a man. Win-win.

If he is to be this level of attractive to you, he will get the attention of other women. So youll try to get commitment and manipulate him to ensure your security and this will generate beta behaviour from him if he gives in, its called poison dripping and makes him worse so that you feel secure. And then hell be unattractive. Or he doesnt give in, but maybe he sleeps around and you dont want that either. Win-lose in short term maybe, lose-lose in long term definitely

OCD, autism, social anxiety and misophonia. Ive tried PUA and dating sites to disastrous results. The former I didnt know any better about and I regret even trying it.

And with this era of Coronavirus, not going outside has got me to this point. I am an autistic neckbeard creep. And I wanna stop.

Here are some examples of digging myself into a hole:

* I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside
* Im on Disability Welfare
* I have creeped out literally every girl that I have some sort of interest in due to getting obsessive and impatient.
* Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. 
* I am 130kg

I just do not want to be like this anymore. I dont want to keep creeping out everyone I walk past and be pitied like I was all my adulthood.

The worst part? I get panic attacks after hearing crowd noises and applause. This means no concerts, clubs or events. What the fuck am I meant to do here? Thankfully I wear noise-cancelling earphones with pink noise which can let me go to the city without panic.

When I first lost it, I was like was that it? So right now Im glad youre seeking help. What the others have said is take walk or start lifting. 

Im so glad I started lifting not only it help your health it also boosted your confidence. However, since all the gyms are closed right now Ill suggest just taking walks then start transitioning into running. Also, like another redditor had said to start worrying about your looks as well. Girls actually see that, if you cared about how you dress/groom yourself. It shows that how you actually present yourself as a person. I highly suggest going to therapy to get your mental health back on track as well.  At the end of the day, is the fact youre trying to better yourself. Since the gyms are closed, I hope you join one once this all blows over. I know you may feel intimidated at first, but honestly people dont care about what you look like or do. Since they are there to workout and move on with their day. Because at the end of the day youre there to better yourself. If they say something about you they can go fuck themselves. I met a lot of friends from the gym. 

Also, one last thing is during this time find a hobby and start branching and find people with similar interests. Then build a connection with them and you never know that you might find that someone and it blossom into something more. I suggest trying to find three hobbies that helps you be creative, money, and being healthy. I as would like to suggest a book to read as well. Its called The subtle of art of not giving a fuck by mark Manson. Truly a really good book on developing a better mindset. You got this I believe in you. This whole subreddit got your back.

The key stereotype of neckbeards is poor hygiene, if you want to break out of it then get that hygiene under control. Bad hygiene is something that people will unanimously judge you poorly for and for good reason, take that away and youre already leaps and bounds better off.

Step 2, start dieting and exercising. Quarantine is one of the best times to do this. There are tons of how to guides for heavier people who may have a hard time with exercising, itll show you where to start and build yourself up. Remember, its a lifestyle change not just a temporary thing. Its good for your health though, so it for health first and looks second.

Finding a job and working on social anxiety will be hard right now. For your anxiety that might require therapy, Im not a professional but it sound like you may have an actual anxiety disorder. Read the book Overcoming Shyness and Social Anxiety by Gillian Butler, its a book thats given to social anxiety sufferers by doctors in the UK. Itll help you understand your thought patterns better and be a good how to guide on facing your fears.",0
3411,3412,"tl;dr: Exercise is by far one of the most irreplaceable methods of improvement and self-love, with one of the best guaranteed return for your investment. Whatever you may think you are, it's better to be that AND fit.

-----

Self-discipline is unique and has no substitute. There is no other way to do something than to just do it. Whenever you feel like not doing what you should, try this: acknowledge to yourself this emotion and then simply *do it anyway*.

The best time to start is twenty years ago, the second best time is yesterday. To address your specific examples:

> I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside

Pursue proper hygiene for your own benefit. It's much better to exist in a physical husk that is clean and smells nice. Also, you don't get another body and teeth aren't going to grow back. Even from a financial perspective you are saving money with good habits. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

> Im on Disability Welfare

It's a tool. Use it to attain the point of the tool: progressing past needing it.

> I have creeped out literally every girl that I have some sort of interest in due to getting obsessive and impatient.

Reflect on what you could've done differently. Try that. Reflect again. Repeat. The only real mistake is not learning from your mistakes.

> Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. 

Bro. Literally throwing money in the trash is better than spending it on egirls. There will always be more women for you out there, there will not be more yourself for you.

Spend the money on your own self-interests instead. Basic exercise equipment, healthy whole foods, clothes that fit, fundamental hygiene accessories, etc.

> I am 130kg

This is one of the most salient areas of improvement right now. You don't need to leave the house to start living healthier. Drink enough water, get enough sleep, eat enough protein + vitamins/minerals, and AT LEAST one hour of exercise a day. Day 1: sufficiently taxing cardiovasular activity (lay down and bicycle pedal if you have to) and Day 2: strength training. Repeat. Eat less calories than you burn to lose weight. You can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.

> I just do not want to be like this anymore. I dont want to keep creeping out everyone I walk past and be pitied like I was all my adulthood.

GOOD. Harness that.

> The worst part? I get panic attacks after hearing crowd noises and applause. This means no concerts, clubs or events. What the fuck am I meant to do here? Thankfully I wear noise-cancelling earphones with pink noise which can let me go to the city without panic.

You could spend another quarter of a century being unproductive and STILL have more than enough time to turn your life around. You are still at the beginning of creating who you are, the finish line isn't even remotely close to being visible.

The most important thing is to structure this progress. Don't overwhelm yourself with impossible goals and then get dejected when they don't work out. All you need to do is NOT do nothing, even if it's just one thing per day.

3412,3413,"The RedPill on Propaganda in democratic countries from an immigrant from an ex-Communist country using anti-Chinese Propaganda as an exposeeMany in the West claim ""our Press is free and fair and is not controlled by the government and therefore we have NO propaganda!"". I am here to show you how wrong this is. Coming from an ex-communist country, my propaganda detector is well honed. The Propaganda machine in the West is far more insidious than that of a ""totalitarian"" nation. While a ""totalitarian"" nation may blatantly repress dissenting speech and thus make the dissenters look like martyrs, the West - under the guise of free and fair press and under the guise of democracy can shape and influence public opinion and few will be the wiser as there is no blatant repression of speech and thus no obvious tyranny to resist. Furthermore, repressing overt nationalism further aids the propaganda machine, as any anti-country news will be viewed as ""objective"" because it is not overtly nationalistic. But ironically this conception plays into peoples need to identify with a tribe, and people do so subconciously while being able to feel good about themselves that they are non-nationalistic and a fighter for ""democracy"" and ""freedom"".

Why do I write this? Today I have received a blatant anti-chinese propaganda newspaper on my doorstep, from a previously unknown newspaper that is encouraged by the municipal government.

Since we on the redpill are concerned with truth, we should not only be seeking truth in terms of women, but also truths of the world and how the powers that be are attempting to influence our perceptions indirectly. As an unassimilated immigrant it is much easier to see and fight back against attempted mind control, not only because I have seen this in my own country but because I am already distrustful of the culture as a whole.

Attached I present you the first page of this propaganda piece. Not only does the paper present an anti-china stance, it is also an expos on how language is on how language is manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.

It almost feels like we are on war footing, with the level of anti-chinese propaganda occuring and it progressively ramping up. It seems to me that the Western governments do not want this crises to go to waste and are looking to bring down the greatest threat to the Western rule since the fall of the USSR if not since ever.

China is poised on the brink of becoming the new world leader and to wrest control of the world from the United States - if it weathers this storm, I think it will become unstoppable manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.

The Western method of propaganda and influence of the population works in much the same ways that TRP suggests one influences women, through insinuation, implication and plausible deniability - never through direct statement. This is why the Soviet propaganda machine was inferior to that of the US, it operated on absolutes rather than insinuations (at least internally - it was much more effective externally). I recognize this method of propaganda, because this is how the KGB ran its own Propaganda campaigns in Western countries, creating fake papers and journal articles to influence western governments to believe in the possibility of nuclear winter and thus make the idea of nuclear disarmament more plausible.

I write this as a warning to all of you living your daily lives, just as you are wary of women and the bluepill regarding them, be aware that much of the same techniques are used to control and influence your thoughts regarding the political situation in the country.

and why exactly is collectivization bad? collectivization protects the individual from harmful influences, gives him a goal to live towards and protects him from the consumerist nihilism present in the modern world. in fact, collectivization would solve many western problems from the opioid epidemic, to obesity, to feminism to male suicide.

collectivization is holding people to a standard necessary for survival/prosperity. if you oppose it, you oppose standards, which means you want to stay mediocre making you essentially bluepill

>Godlike strict rules (you can not pass a red light as pedestrian otherwise -good citizen score, wtf?), the ""new man"", dictatorship, etc 

so what you are saying is you are opposing social order? Why is social order a bad thing?

>I preffer to live in a roman republic( most democracies are based on the roman republic model)

No most democracies are not based on the roman republic model. the roman republic model is actualy close to the chinese ruling system, where a small cadre of men (the senate or in china's case the politburo) make decisions and then execute them.

western nations are a twisted form of athenian democracy.

>Kinda hard to believe that there are drones flying in USA to monitor you or NSA archieving literally all text messages and listening to all your phone calls.

But again, kinda hard to see USA doing it, it would result in a more responsable society I imagine.

>hina is doing better economically, yea, in some areas facing starvation, poverty and other stuff like that. If it is as you say, would you also add the argument that Germany under A.H. was an economical power also?

just because there is poverty in some places in china does not at all take away from its economic achievements. it has singlehandledy raised hundreds of millions out of poverty and continue to raise millions more every year.

And yes, germany was an economic miracle under AH

>Ok, I see why you bought women into discussion, you made a point. Well, communism exists in countries like Cuba, China, N Koreea, Vietnam, not sure about Venez and all of them are crap holes, except China that is doing better because they liberalised their economy.

capitalism exists in many places of the world - brazil, belize, cote d'ivore, democratic republic of congo, etc and they are all doing poorly economically - does that mean that capitalism is a failure?

both articles are sourced, so you can check where the claims the articles make are derived from.",0
3419,3420,"Ooook, so, let's begin.
1. There is a difference betweet starving because of commies and capitalism. In capitalism, you have a real canche to get out of poverty, in commie, no.
2. Commies also start wars so, no strong point there. Taiwan? Tibet? Butan? Hong Kong?
3. Your ""propaganda"" is not real. China is solely at fault for Corona. Look at their culture. They eat dogs, cats, bats, koalas, snakes, etc and thet try to eat it as raw as possible because it is considered healthy. Well, that backfired, did it not with Covid? In this case: eating bats is not a good thing. Some cultures are better than others.
Still on propaganda: I can watch, listen and read pretty much everything in democracy, can even real Mein Kampf if I want, you can buy it but not in China.  Media must he aproved by the gov first, not cool.
The ""propaganda"" that you showed, it is in fact, reality. Sad to break your commie chinese love but reallity is reallity, just like TRP regarding woman. Get over the anger phase.
4. No, cult of personality is not raising someone as an example. Stop toying woth words, you start to sound like an SHW/Antifa. Cult of perso is when you are forcebly shoved in your throat a person. For example: Stalin, Hitler, Muso, Che, Fidel, the Kims of Korea, Hirohito in WW2, Mao, etc.
5. No, it is not bad, that's why we have universal free healthcare (at least in EU), free schools and colleges, police, firemans, housing program, car program.
People are not born and will not be able to be all equals, have same chances, this is by default. You might be good at math but I really suck at it, for real.
You might be bad at programming but I am a sharp tool in programming PLCs in Step7, TIA Portal and also designing electrical systems in Eplan. You and me are by default not equal. Equality in chanses, not really, again. Even with free healthcare, education and all, there can not be equallity. Stop this commie thinking please. Also, people do not like to be equals and the same. Not everyone wants a VW Passat, others want Seat Leon for example or Fiat.
Also, you want to be equal with Elon but Elon does bot want to be equal with you.
6 capitalism creates them naturally and by that I mean rich people just became rich because reasons. Commies just creates artificial rich people.
So you are a starter banker? If you are not in my close group of friends and not commie, nope, bye. The state wants you out of the elite plus you do not seems, subjectively, dedicated to the commie ideals.
Sorry man but you are really losing this discussion. Commie is bad for culture, humanity, science, etc. Whatever.
7. What other political parties are in China? Is there a liberal party? Conservatorist party? And I am talking in EU politic terms (USA is garbage with politics). Nope, only commies and if you do not vote commies, you are a bad, bad citizen, off to reeducation with you.
I am not in the USA sphere of thinking. We have opposition here that fights for it's causes. The democrat socialists were in power in Romania, they did terrible things and wanted to do more like pardoning people accused of corruption, fraud and money washing but the opposition managed to unite (liberals, technocrates, idk if i spelled it correctly, other socialist formation) and together with the people's protests, the social democrats felt. This is an example.
China? Nope, no opposition, no protests, nothing.
8 Yes, I am romanian and collectivisation left a huge wound and scar in our society and for me also. My grand grand father owned a lot of land that was productive, he was working it but when the commies vame to power, he was executed because he did not want to give hi's private property to the commies. After 24 years of commie downfall, my family managed to get back only 60% of our rightful lands.
No, collectivisation is not ok. It kills private innitiative, it keeps people poor, it keeps people in slavery, etc.
Stop thinking red. You are in TRP and you come with all this crap? Obesity is because people do not care what and how much they eat. Suicide rates in males is mostly because they are pussies and not being able to man up. Feminism, how it has affairs in collectivisation?
Yes, I oppose collectivisation so you can call me a bluepill beta male, I do not care. My wallet says other thing and the keys I have on my keyring also say other thing. Ask my lawyer also and he will say another thing regarding the rest of 40% of the missing property that will be gained back.
9. I will not comment on that, it just sounds so SJW retarded crap with social order. What do you even mean by that? Always explain yourself man when you are having a discussion with someone or an argument. Chill, I view this as a discussion and I would like to get more replies from you on this subject.
Regarding my point made for Godlike strict rules: no, I would not like such a system that tells me how to walk, what to wear, how to interract with people, what hairstyle shall I have.
The ""new man"" is bad because totalitarian regimes impose their view. In commie Romania, the commies envisioned that the new man (does not matter what sex you are) must be an engineer, architect, excellent at maths and exceptional scientists. There was no room for philosophers, artists, bankers, priests and other occupations related to those fields. Not good, a stable and functioning society needs everyone. From garbage collector, ticket seller, waitress, baker, banker, broker, aetist, philosofer, priest, stripper to engineers, mechanics, scientists, etc.
10. No, the roman republic =/= chinese republic. Do your homework please. USA, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, UK, Canada, Italy, etc are based on roman republics. China is just a dictatorship, a plain one.
11. No, there are no drones, spy camers, secret police, radar vans, etc in EU countries. In USA maybe, I do not know but in EU, nope. As I stated in this post previously, policits are totally different from USA and EU. Bernie is the only socialist in USA. The rest are conservators that are both in the left and right side which is impossible. Only Bernie can ve a lefty because socialism and communism in left. But again, I do not know much about USA politics. I view USA as being retarded. While the whole world uses metric system, they adopted their strange and confusing metrics in all aspects of life.
Wtf is a yard, gallon, mile, inch, fahrenheid (i am sure i spelled it incorrectly), lefties, righties in USA?
12 Well, if China was so rich like you said, why it did not made a huge national program for all people to have electric cars? Heavely reduce air pollution, ban kid labor, not affording more thay 1 kid in family, etc. Nope, even tho China is an economic giant, it's people are still poor.
Also, Germany's economy during A.H. was strong is fake. Nope, it was not an economic miracle. Hitler knew it and also he said it. That's one of many reasons he went to war, for hi's country not to economically fail in the next 5-10 years after '38. Please, just please, do not throw the ""but brah, da tankz"" because GE was not having that many tanks that others believed and also the tanks were crappy tanks. I would take a Sherman, Stuart, T34, SU, Firefly over any crappy Panther, Tiger, Toger 2, Elephant and also I would take a Spitfire and Hurricane over any german fighter until the jet ones.
13. Well, communism surely failed. It was present in so many countries during the Cold War and then it felt down.
South America, Africa and other capitalist failed countries do not represent an against capitalism point. It is important to see how they failed also.
I can say about Romania. It is a struggling capitalist country because 1. We did not know what capitalism is after 1989 so we are still learning what it is. 2. Our geopolitical position was against it. For cebturies we were invaded and razed by Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Russia, Austria. Can't really develop when your villages and small cities are razed, can you? 3. After 1989, people choosed neo commies and guess what neo commies did, they ruined the economy. Do you want details? I will give them if you want. In 2000, there was another chance. Between a nationalist, racist, commie hater, extremist and a commie hooligan, Romania choosed the commie. Vadim Tudor lost the elections because all ex commies allied against him and started a massive propaganda and spread fear (if he is elected, we all gonna die, executed, at gun point. He will lead us in chaos, dictatorship). The commies feared him because they knew that if Vadim would be elected, all ex commies would be shot, deported, jailed and monarchy would be reinstalled back in Romania under Michael the First.


Can you provide more sources claiming that US soldiers planted the virus in China besides UNZ?

As a resume: yes, commie is bad, no doubt in that and China created and exported Covid 19 by eating crazy stuff, more exctly in this situation: bats. I am not implying or advocating that China should be nuked, attacked with soldiers or anything but instead, China should apologise and take responsability for the situation and also stop being hyprocrites. Some cultures are just better than others my friend.


Edit: you claim to be red pilled but you are against it with commie loving ideas. If you look at TRP ideas, values and way of thinking, well, those things would not be allowed in a commie state for both genders.",0

3422,3423,"Why are the caring loving fathers against their daughters being a housewife and dating an older man?If I follow the redpill ideology it says that the best thing I should do at 21, should be to stop going to uni, get married to a man 10-15 years older than me and be a SAHM. But my father was actually the one who wanted me to be an indpendant career woman, to have my own money, to study hard, and he say himself that he will never accept a guy whos more than 8 years older than me as a son-in-law. 

Hes not the only one, cause most of my friends that had a great relationship with their fathers seems to get the same advices which is studying, enjoying their youth, having their own money and then getting married to someone they love and theyre attracted to.

My uncle literally hated his daughters boyfriend because he was overweight and short, which means that men are not against women dating chads when it comes to their beloved daughters 

Especially that its funny how most men hate being judged for their career, but theyre the first to look down on their daughters boyfriend if hes jobeless.


The only fathers that are okay with their daughters having low standards usually turn out to be abusives parents and partners that dont give a shit about their offsprings, but most fathers who love their daughters seems to wants them to follow a path that contradict what the redpill wants for women",0

Because they know they failed to teach you and prepare you to vet for the kind of men that is ok to be a SAHM/W with.

They know that they made such a poor job that if you try to be a SAHM/W it is likely that you will pick a man that is incapable of doing his part or flat out evil.

And since they still want what is best for you instead of teaching you right from the begginng they take the easy route and just tell you to avoid the risk. They didn't bother to give you the tools you needed to chase the path of the SAHM/W if you wanted it, so they just advice you against it.

There are no *""shoulds""*. A woman can do as she wants. Her goals are her own to decide.

That is the risk she takes with the benefits that being a SAHM/W brings. It is on her to decide if the benefits are worth the risks. I know I would consider them worth it if I was a woman.

3432,3433,"Issues with dressing feminine and my boyfriend's reactionsHi RPW, I'm 18 and my boyfriend is 20. We have been dating for two years.
I have been lurking the sub for awhile now and just recently (~4 months I'd say) switched my wardrobe from jeans, crop tops, and sneakers, to more feminine clothing such as dresses, heels, jewelry etc. This style change has made me instantly more confident and in tune with my femininity. I never thought I'd love dresses this much!

However, I'm having a problem with how my boyfriend has reacted to these changes. It's not like he is telling me what and what not to wear - he says he likes me in everything. However, I've been having some self-esteem issues when it comes to his reactions.
Whenever I wear tight leggings or jeans (I will every once in awhile now), he goes crazy over it and talks about how good/sexy I look. But I've noticed that when I wear my dresses that make me feel beautiful/feminine, he rarely ever comments. This is confusing me because here on RPW I keep reading that high value men appreciate a modestly dressed feminine woman, but I get wayyy more of a reaction from my bf when I'm at my least confident clothing-wise (jeans/leggings).

Honestly, it makes me pretty sad. For instance, I came to his house the other day wearing my hair in a messy bun, leggings, a tanktop and a jean jacket, and he said ""Wow, you look like you took a few extra minutes to get ready this morning"" and I was instantly confused? Then when I wear a long, flowy dress and my hair down and makeup done CRICKETS  It's driving me insane!
Not sure what's going on here and I would love some insight! Thank you RPW!",0
3433,3434,"It sounds like he prefers a more showy style. That's okay - there's no rule that says you must wear dresses and heels to be RP. In fact, many would say that it's appropriate to dress in a way that pleases your man.

3434,3435,Hes not into that look. Doesnt mean it looks bad or it looks bad on you... some guys just have a look they prefer thats all. ill be 30 next year..growing up i remember alot of girls in dresses. Nowadays? Dont see it too often. Maybe hes just not used to it. Its hard to guess..you gotta pry the answer out of him lol.,0
3435,3436,"He's not mature yet. He likes you looking like painted on clothes because he likes to look. That's it.

For people like myself who need to have an ethical explanation for what they do, here's why it is fair/not a double standard.

Men and women live different lives and are born with unique gifts and potentials, some overlapping, some not. Despite knowing this and capitalizing on their feminine power, many women (and their clueless simp supporters) will still try to shame men for being very choosy with their wives/common law partners/ mother of their children. 

A man building himself to his ideal man, creating an expanding frame and acquiring intellectual and physical resources will arouse and attract women as he gains momentum. Women may be ""attracted"" to the outward results of his success, but we all know they are ""aroused"" by his upward energy, his alphaness, his mission. Any woman who seduces him on that journey upward is temporarily stopping him. She has grabbed his attention temporarily, and when he busts a nut, he is satisfied where he is. Weak men stay here but an alpha man hops back on the horse and keeps moving upward. He has only been temporarily stopped.

When this man has spent many many years building himself, he may decide he is ready for a kid. This means he is very satisfied with where he is such that he is willing to now sacrifice mental physical and emotional energy into the next generation. He is literally sacrificing himself, his upward progress and his current wealth for this woman and child. This woman is getting a lot from this man- loyalty, tons of investment, and he is giving up a lot of other women who would love to be part of his now really established frame.

All he is asking back from this woman, is that she be worth giving all that up for. What makes her worth giving that up for? Certainty, or as close to it as he can come, that she will stay loyal to his frame. If she has a history of promiscuity, this means she is very willing to jump from frame to frame, giving herself to men in quick succession. Why would I commit to a woman for 18+ years if she can't stick to one frame? For a promiscuous man, the reverse isn't true. The difference is that for men to have sex, they dont need to enter a womans frame. They havent submitted to her and her reality, but the reverse happens for women. He was always simply building and expanding his frame, allowing women to enter temporarily. She on the other hand has been jumping from frame to frame.

So you see, as a man ascends and sleeps with many women along the way, enjoying them and potentially looking out for a LTR material (if hes at the phase), he is not doing damage to his ability to be loyal and invest heavily in a woman and child. This is because he has never submitted to any one woman's frame, he only built his own. The same cannot be said for a promiscuous woman.",1

Now normally i would just think ok she doesn't have high interest, but there's two things that make it interesting 

- she is 26. when we started talking i said i hinted i wasnt looking for anything serious, but she said she would be open to something serious. I said let's see how it goes. Note, she told me she has ridden the CC for the last 3 years, so I think she's looking for a provider now

When you say something like this, a girl will by default feel like a loser if she's your something casual if she was raised even remotely decently. (Or even if like your girl, she was raised by the streets and is now wary of guys like you.)  

Maybe you say it because you want to be honest, or maybe you say it because it gets you off to emulate some FR you read on here. 

But realize that the game for a woman is commitment, and by outright shutting the possibility of her success down without supplanting it with a new fantasy (IE: How amazing being casual with you would be,) she ends up needing to do a lot of emotional labor to hamster what she's doing with you.

I dont believe this is true.

I think society functions best when the base assumption is everyone is entitled to being loved, having sex and enjoying at least one relationship.

I find it alarming that in a culture where we obsess about the health and welfare of the environment and animal kingdom, we care so little about each other and our collective mental health and happiness.

The superficiality and cruelty that define the dating market should be beneath the type of people we believe ourselves to be.

Incels of both genders should have access to legal prostitution and both men and women should be encouraged to be less shallow and more generous in their dealings with each other.

So many people now end opportunities for happiness because theyre not getting 100% of everything on their list, mostly women.

This dull, checklist-style approach to dating sucks all the fun out of interactions for both genders and leaves many on the sidelines who are good people and would make good partners if others could just get over their superficiality.

In short, I think the current state of dating is sad, cruel and shallow, and the idea that only the most shiniest people deserve love is a big reason behind it.",0

If youre like 95% of dudes, you either dont know or dont give a fuck about style. You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go.

You wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else.

For a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else.

And if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you.

You wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them.

You never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you.

Thats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style.

# What da Fuck is Style?

** Orson Welles**

&#x200B;

A High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him.

Why?

Because his style is a visual representation of who he is.

**It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.***

# I'm too hot  - hot damn - Called a police and a fireman

&#x200B;

Your style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier  easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet.

Its a value add on on every level.

People will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it.

&#x200B;

# Developing Your Style

&#x200B;

*Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.*

** Epictetus**

&#x200B;

Developing your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition  it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort.

The same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life.

And yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.*

Thats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think  fuck that dude looks good.

I cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style.

But there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process;

 

# Fit is King

It doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is  be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear  fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.***

You see it all the time  fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance.

None of this shit works.

So learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration  thats half the work done.

 

# Stick to the Classics

&#x200B;

*""I live for myself and I answer to nobody.""*

*** Steve McQueen***

You dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented  all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.*

[Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years.

If you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it  he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits.

Theres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish  all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen.

 

# Keep it Simple

*Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.*

Classic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics:

&#x200B;

***Colour.***

Your colour friends are  [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589)  black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown.

Thats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match.

&#x200B;

***Less is more***

&#x200B;

*All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret  the simpler the better.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

The 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of.

*You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.*

So learn to choose carefully  or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch.

# Steal from Your Icons

*One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

If you look at any famous creative people  musicians, artists, designers, film makers  none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.

Developing your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them. Then tweak it & develop it until it becomes your own. Its that simple.

*It is totally impossible to be well-dressed in cheap shoes.*

** Hardy Amies**

Why spend 100 bucks on a [polo shirt](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/embroidered-cuban-collar-polo-shirt-mens-vega-in-ecru-cream/?category_id=1111&gaEeList=M%20-%20Tops) when you can get 8 for that price? Well, the answer is easy  for 100 bucks, you get quality in terms of design, materials and fit that will last. For 12 bucks, you get a [poorly fitting polo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Lavendar-XX-Large/dp/B07N4P9DS6/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=polo+shirt&qid=1585770945&sr=8-8) made from low grade materials that looks like it cost 12 bucks and - after a few washes - is worthless. One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you.

The difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1).

If you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear.

&#x200B;

**Shop online**

A retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need  good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why.

Youre also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain.

So shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe  youll never wear it.

&#x200B;

**Never Go Full Retail**

All designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack  wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites.

Other places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail.

If youre like 95% of dudes, you either dont know or dont give a fuck about style. You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go.

You wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else.

For a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else.

And if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you.

You wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them.

You never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you.

Thats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style.

# What da Fuck is Style?

&#x200B;

**Its not about matching your belt with your shoes.**

&#x200B;

*Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.*

** Orson Welles**

&#x200B;

A High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him.

Why?

Because his style is a visual representation of who he is.

**It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.***

&#x200B;

*""Remind yourself. Nobody built like you, you design yourself.""*

**- Jay Z**

# I'm too hot  - hot damn - Called a police and a fireman

&#x200B;

Your style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier  easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet.

Its a value add on on every level.

People will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it.

&#x200B;

*""It is both delusional and stupid to think that clothes don't really matter and we should all wear whatever we want. Most people don't take clothing seriously enough, but whether we should or not, clothes do talk to us and we make decisions based on people's appearances.""*

# Developing Your Style

&#x200B;

*Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.*

** Epictetus**

&#x200B;

Developing your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition  it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort.

The same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life.

And yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.*

Thats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think  fuck that dude looks good.

I cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style.

But there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process;

 

# Fit is King

It doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is  be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear  fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.***

You see it all the time  fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance.

None of this shit works.

So learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration  thats half the work done.

 

# Stick to the Classics

&#x200B;

*""I live for myself and I answer to nobody.""*

*** Steve McQueen***

You dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented  all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.*

[Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years.

If you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it  he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits.

Theres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish  all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen.

 

# Keep it Simple

*Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.*

Classic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics:

&#x200B;

***Colour.***

Your colour friends are  [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589)  black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown.

Thats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match.

&#x200B;

***Less is more***

&#x200B;

*All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret  the simpler the better.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

The 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of.

*You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.*

So learn to choose carefully  or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch.

# Steal from Your Icons

*One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

If you look at any famous creative people  musicians, artists, designers, film makers  none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.

Developing your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them. Then tweak it & develop it until it becomes your own. Its that simple.

# Show Me the Money

*It is totally impossible to be well-dressed in cheap shoes.*

** Hardy Amies**

&#x200B;

Why spend 100 bucks on a [polo shirt](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/embroidered-cuban-collar-polo-shirt-mens-vega-in-ecru-cream/?category_id=1111&gaEeList=M%20-%20Tops) when you can get 8 for that price? Well, the answer is easy  for 100 bucks, you get quality in terms of design, materials and fit that will last. For 12 bucks, you get a [poorly fitting polo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Lavendar-XX-Large/dp/B07N4P9DS6/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=polo+shirt&qid=1585770945&sr=8-8) made from low grade materials that looks like it cost 12 bucks and - after a few washes - is worthless. One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you.

The difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1).

You've gotta meet her parents and figure out if they're gonna make shit harder for you or not. Lots of shit goes into marrying a girl.

One year tho? That's kinda early. I'd say deflect the shit out of it. You can always be truthful and say you want both of you to be making good money first.

Many cult experts have predicted that with the growing accessibility of the internet, cults are going to go mostly online and be more difficult to identify.Gone are the days of a cult being a group of people locked up in a compound. So I wouldn't be surprised if TRP checks most of the boxes.

3496,3497,"I used to date a Red pill guy - untill he dumped me for being ""too serious"" and ""wanting a family"" (Directly disproving everything they preach)

I used to date a guy that was obsessed with 4chan..so that's why I know everything about the red pill etc...all of their theories about women.. I even got a bit brainwashed and started believing him.. Not just about the pill but everything else that they believe on 4 chan/pol..


I think I've been a pretty good girlfriend..loyal, madly in love with him, did all the housework, I love cooking and baking, got along with his friends and family, big boobs, always wearing dresses and makeup.. fulfilling all of his sexual fantasies (even though most of them hurt me and I really didn't enjoy them).....you name it.. I was basically the ""red pill fantasy girl""


I even made sure we split the bills equally, eventhough he earnt more money than me..

You know what happened??

This ""Red pill"" ""traditional"" man, was the one that dumped me! And you know what was his reason?? That I'm ""too serious"".

In his words precisely: ""I know you want to settle down, and have kids in a couple of years..and I'm not ready for this"" (he was in his late 20s / almost 30 if that matters) He also said he wanted to try dating other women - basically seeing if he can find someone hotter.

So here you have a real life example of the Red pill men.. Uncapable of emotions..only caring about looks..and not willing to raise a family..

I loved him, was willing to drop everything for him, settle down,.. And he's the one that wasn't ready.. 


Red pill is the worst thing that has happened to me... I can't believe I fell for it...I lost almost all of my friends over it as well, because I defended my ex and his beliefs about genders / race...

Until that happened...and I realised it was all bullshit...I can't believe he's still a part of that community after what he's done to me...

All of this has pushed me in a hardcore depression... I'm starting to doubt men are even capable of having feelings...


Anyway...just wanted to get this off my chest.....this was my wake up call...and now I'm trying to fix years of being brainwashed..


TL; DR: A red pilled man dumped me for being ""too serious"", and ""wanting a family"" sometime in the future..",0

&#x200B;

In your post, you convey that you did a lot of things for your partner's sake that you didn't enjoy, that you were brainwashed by his ideology, and that you isolated yourself from friends.

&#x200B;

That translates to: You were willing to push aside your own boundaries and discomfort, put aside your ability to critically evaluate his ideology, and isolated yourself from other sources of stability and insight.  


It might sound silly, but almost all of us at some point in our lives are willing to do just that when: 1) We're in situations where we don't have much experience, or 2) We have some things about ourselves which cause us to feel insecure and willing to not respect our own wants and needs.  


The important part is to spend time learning more about yourself and figuring out if it was inexperience or insecurity.  If it was mainly inexperience, you can chalk this relationship up to the 'lesson learned' side.  You will know to avoid a man like him in the future when it comes to relationships.  


If it was an insecurity, you'll continue to date the same kind of guy again and again until you strengthen, heal, and understand the things you feel insecure about.  


Sometimes RedPill guys are right when they disparagingly say 'All Women Are Like That'... and sometimes women are right when they say disparagingly say 'All Men Are Like That'.  Not because what they believe is true, but because they live their lives in such a way that they filter out all the healthy people who are \*not\* like that.

It's important to learn from this relationship so that you don't partner with another man like that and end up losing friends and disrespecting yourself.  


Being alone for a while sucks.  Ending a relationship sucks.  Losing friends sucks.  
But you really lucked out that this relationship ended.

3502,3503,"Sorry to hear what you went through. But still, when you say "" I'm starting to doubt men are even capable of having feelings... "", I think that is a very BOLD statement! because you are basically generalizing here, have you tried ALL MEN to know that they don't have feelings?! SOME DO HAVE FEELINGS (if that's good or bad I still don't know myself)...

I think this is a common cause of being ""too nice"" of a person and not getting the results you wanted/expected. Therefore comes the frustration.

I, as a young man of 23 years old, am in the same situation. I had a breakup because apparently I was ""too nice"" for her and wanted to commit into a marriage and have children. By showing that I had emotions and that I deeply cared about her, I think I scared her away??!! (things just started going sour after I opened up to her).

After this breakup, I got involved into TRP community and started buying into all their crap... Barely got to the point of hating all women because of their suppose ""hypergamy"" and all the mind games ""they play"" on us men... But after a while, I realized it's all BS. 

It just depends on the people you meet in your life and the way they think/see things.

Let's break the cycle of generalization and hate towards the opposite gender. People are people, some click with you, others don't. Just appreciate the good moments and try to move on.

My best advice is: Love yourself and then you might find someone who loves you back the way you are and is on the same page with your goals in life.",0

&#x200B;

Hello Everyone,

I have just watched this documentary which tends to show the reality of this hookup culture particularly focusing on graduates celeberating spring break on florida beaches. Some particular examples I would like to quote,

""It is easier to find FWB than boyfriends"" (girl 1)

""Guys believe they are entitled to our bodies; there is almost this one guy in every party who try to rip off my clothes"" (girl 2)

""I had always felt pressure from woman magazines to look sexy for boys and engage in frequent sex to get the validation I wanted"" (girl 3)

""I have always felt pressurerized to lose my virginity"" (Guy 1)

""Sex is not about love anymore, its about pleasure only. I don't have to know a girl to get into her pants. Let me demonstrate you (goes to demonstrate it)... You see, its so easy, the more intoxicated she is, the more likely she will drop her panties"" (Guy 2)

""I have come with my girlfriend here and I don't mind if she hooks up somewhere \[lol a cuck\]"" (Guy 3)

I live in a conservative muslim country where sexual market is controlled and free sex is frowned upon but thanks to feminism it is quickly changing. I used to believe that I had a disadvantage by not being born into a western liberal country but I don't think its true anymore. Its not because the girls are magically better but its because feminism has still not been able to destroy the fabric of this society. A regulated sexual market is both good for men and women, women retain their pair bonding ability and men don't have to worry about being compared to past sexual partners. Its a win-win situation for almost everyone (almost). Most people confuse TRP with another form of seduction and alpha male to be just a fucking machine. However, the reality is that in a society having the concept of masculinity solely revolving around the number of sexual partners could (almost) never produce homely virgin girls (with few exceptoins). The rise of feminsim has seen the rise of pornification of society, single motherhood, divorce rates, false rape accusations and other social ills. Women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas. They love to masculinize themsleves in order to get the dose of power which they could never taste even if they do they shall never be content because a woman's satisfaction lies in her being protected by a man. Being alpha is not about banging numerous women, this may have been an advantage during the dark ages but we are no longer in the dark ages and sticking to this dogma may damage male pysche as well e.g. depressing over not losing one's virginity due to peer pressure instead of working towards worthwhile goals. Is Dan Brazalian more alpha than an anverage guy who is working towards his goal and fortunately have a stable unicorn?. Hence, we should modify who really is  Alpha male:

1. Always working on self improvment.
2. Protecting his children and women (unicorn exists in controlled sexual markets).
3. Resisting Feminism and porn culture.
4. Achieving goals.
5. (Add what you think is constructive).

The degeneration of western society and downfall of fatherhood shall continue to move on if something is not done against this hedonistic feminsim. Although men have taken advantage from this hook up culture but the price which we are paying is far bigger than what can be put into words.  Banging multiple women cannot make our lives better, yes there is a burst of pleasure but its not good long term. I don't think a hook up culture and controlled sexual markets can co-exist ever.

Most men here use TRP knowledge to get into panites which does work because we know the nature of women but to find a traditional homely women is almost impossible.  I utilize TRP knowledge to pass shit test of women and her attraction only grows when you pass her shit tests. I was one of the victims of plantation culture until I came to TRP and received salvation.

people forget how bad smartphones were in the 1990s and early 2000s. 20 years later, and everyone has one.  sexbots will follow the same technological path, leaving only procreation for bio-women.

but artificial wombs will arrive shortly after and you can already get a surrogate for $40k.  the price is falling too, not rising.  that's astronomically cheaper than marriage, as there's 0% probability you'll ever be divorce raped, and the only way to get cucked is that your DNA testing provider lies to you on your paternity test.",1

I realize they see this as an opportunity to score big and get beta bucks. But am I the only one who loses interest in a girl when that happens? Have had it happen a couple times where shes more eager to be in my life and shes always revolving things around my career/career ambitions. Always gets on my nerves and usually ends with me never contacting them again. Just curious to see if Im not alone in dropping that girl immediately or if anyone uses that dumb stuff to their advantage

Edit:
Just cause everyone is asking. Im in the field of law still finishing up my studying though. I like the comments so far. But Ill throw in a more specific example of when this has happened. Ill mention the career field and they suddenly ask what car I drive, type of house I want etc. Another thing is like when Im confident or vague they start saying like yah I can tell why youre in the field. What annoys me is that they are extra inclined to be in my life and suddenly everything I do is cause of my career lol. Its not a bad I guess. But its just off putting cause its just my career. Im really not the type to care about what field anyone is in cause Im not very judgmental. There is a plus side I guess. Talking about cases that involve like murder always gets a girl extra interested lol. So at least I always have a story.

3544,3545,"how mgotw and redpill made me fearful of women and how I got out.Howdy ladies and gentlemen.

First of all I want to say that I never was an outright member of both movement. I agreed with some concepts and while I never fully drank the koolaid, it profoundly affected me and after 2 long years of being consumed by this ideology, I can finally say that I got it all out of my system. I write this with the hope that it can help others dealing with the same stuff that I've dealt with.

# The beginning

It all started when I was about 17/18-ish. During this time I used to browse 9gag a bunch and in there I would sometime read about people being screwed over, relationship wise. At the time I just thought ""shit happens"", but those posts would come again every now and then.

My downfall really started on quora and reddit. A big difference between 9gag and these 2 Websites was that the posts didn't have character limits. Quora questions like ""how you found out that your xxx was cheating on you"" and subreddits like r/Relationships would lead to posts with lengthy explanations as to how people (usually men) would be cheated on in the worst way possible. I remember how I would spend entire afternoons scrolling and scrolling and this made me extremely anxious.

My current situation was as follows: Overweight, virgin, no friends and my self confidence was at an all time low. Just to make you understand how bad it was, I loathed  and was fearful of calling delivery services / making appointments and I almost had a heart attack while asking for a summer internship over the phone.

# The redpill and mgtow

This is when I started to discover the redpill. I watched channels like sandman and other mgtow related stuff and would start to lurk repill and mgtow subreddits. In the beginning it felt as if the pandora box was opened. They said that Women would cheat on you regardless of your value as a man and that they would milk you dry if you let them do it, and everywhere I looked, I would just find more stories that would confirm what I've read and heard from this redpill people.

Even though I was deep in the red pill, I still would have not considered myself to be an outright member of these group. You see, while I believed in hypergamy and the 20% / 80% stuff, I still couldn't buy the ""all women are like that"" mentality, both from a logical but also an emotional point. i.e. the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are men, but I never heard women saying anything about all men being child predators (as far as  i'm concerned). I also have a wonderful sister that is in a relationship and looking at them I would see the exact opposite of what the redpillers would say. She would often spend money on him, she took interest in what he did, etc. If my sister was like that then it wouldn't have been a far stretch to also believe that other women like my sister existed.

To be completely honest I wasn't angry at women, I was scared of them. I was scared that I could be cheated on, that if I got married, they would divorce me and take my stuff or that that she could have an affair and I would have raised a child that was not mine. To give you an example of how deep my paranoia went, I often played with the idea of having hidden cameras in my house, trackers in vehicles and taking paternity tests behind a potential partner's back just to be sure that I wouldn't not meet the same fate as the people who got fucked over.

# How I got out

Well, to be completely honest it was a multitude of things. First thing first, I deleted reddit and quora. This places were tainted to me and even nowadays I get somewhat nervous if I enter these websites. The next step was actually going my on way. Instead of listening to bitter and resentful people, I slowly  began to block their generalized opinion and actually started to build an opinion of my own. I started to hit the gym (lost 21 kg / 46 pounds) , learned to be impartial and to take any opinion with a grain of salt. More importantly, I started to be critical of my own beliefs. If I didn't have a sound logic to it, it had to go.

Now I'm 20 and I'm far more calm and retrospective person. I'm still a shy guy and still never had a girlfriend, but that's just what it is. I learned to not being so fearful of random people and more importantly pizza delivery services.

On Monday I will call a company to see if they will give me a another summer internship and to be honest, I'm already shitting my pants, but at least now I know that I have to face my fear instead of letting it dominate me.

cheers.

I'm a guy in my early twenties, I'm going to university, and I've been trying to change recently, so I also started reading up on feminism. Now, I've always been generally left-wing, but when I read a feminist critique for example, I sometimes become quite dismissive. What I mean but that is that I think things like:

""That's ridiculous/not true""

""Oh, so that's a problem too?""

""Seems like everything is an issue""

But when I think about the points, I was so eager to dismiss, some more, I'm more open to them and usually understand where they're coming from. However, that first impulse is really weird. It's sort of like I'm realising that I've been benefitting from some of the problems women face in society, simply because of how society is set up, and my brain doesn't want to admit that because it's easier for me to ignore everything and act like I've done nothing wrong and that everything is fine and dandy? 

I have a hard time writing my thoughts down in English, so I hope that I was able to make myself clear.",0
3555,3556,My mother always said the first thought you have about something is often the thought society wants you to have/ the thought you were conditioned to have. It is the second thought that shows who you are. I asume it will get easier after a while to distinguish between what you think because of prejudices and what you really think. Your thought process seems normal to me :) Keep asking yourself uncomfortable questions!,0
3556,3557,"This reminds me of innuendo studios' video series Why are you so Angry? 

He made a few points about how, when you learn something that might make you look bad, your immediate impulse might be to reject it. For example, someone saying ""I can't eat that because I'm vegan"" might make you feel judged so you will react negatively. Even if the vegan doesn't care what you eat, you might feel like their actions present an idea that, if true, could mean that you have been doing something bad for most of your life: eating meat is bad. This makes you feel guilty and judged so you reject the idea and mock the vegan. 

This is explained much better in Innuendo Studio's [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU&list=PLJA_jUddXvY62dhVThbeegLPpvQlR4CjF&index=3&t=0s) but that's the general idea. The video is part 2/6, so sorry if it doesn't make sense without the context of part 1.

3564,3565,"Thoughts about gender-related insults?A friend of mine asked me yesterday if I thought an email she'd written sounded 'bitchy,' and it got me thinking about this. The friend is a feminist, if that makes a difference. Her choice of words took me aback a little because 'bitchy' isn't used often among the people with whom I hang out. I don't use it myself, but due to a general aversion to profanity or otherwise harsh language rather than any concerns about sexism. Upon reflection, though, I thought that 'bitchy' actually bothered me a bit rather than just surprising me. 

*Is* it sexist? 'Bitchy' only ever seems to be directed at either women or people perceived to be acting in a feminine or effeminate manner. Relatedly, the insult 'dick' (which I also don't use, but again not for sexism-related reasons) is pretty much never applied to women. However, something being statistically associated with only one gender doesn't mean it's necessarily sexist. 

It's not like I'd tell my friend she should stop using the term, but I am curious about feminists' views on gender-related insults such as this. Are they sexist? Or does nobody really care? It's quite possible I only took note of it due to great boredom rather than any actual hint of sexism.",0

3570,3571,"I moderate a large subreddit. Some time ago, we decided to stop letting people use gendered slurs entirely. No bitch, dick, or pussy. No whore, no slut, no man-ups, no man-child, no fuckboy. The results were the following: 

* A lot of people got mad about the policy (and still do)
* Everyone got nicer
* All the comments got more constructive
* The amount of whining about the gender double-standard went way, way down and people focused on these specifics of the situation. 

I honestly didn't expect this to work. Never in my dizziest daydreams did I think this would have much of an impact. But it *did* have an impact. I've actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why that might be. 

I think that when people use a gendered slur as shorthand and then you take it away from them, they won't rephrase it to the exact same level of vitriol because they don't necessarily mean *that thing they said*. When people stop being able to ask, ""Am I just being a bitch"" and have to ask the question another way, they typically don't go to the most derogatory counterexample. Rarely it is rephrased to ""am I just being angry and controlling for no reason"". They have to clarify what they think being a 'bitch' means, and that could be controlling, manipulative, assertive, mean-spirited, cruel, or crazy. I might also mean a better meaning like, ""Are my expectations unreasonable?"" or ""Am I asking too much to expect that my partner ___"". 

The way people respond to those two questions is dramatically different too. People often will echo ""Yes, you're a bitch"" back, but they will answer ""Am I being unreasonable"" with ""No, boundaries are important"". Gender bias plays out in this situation like you wouldn't believe. People who are disinclined to support a woman who might be being a ""bitch"" to their partner (even if the specifics of the situation are the exact same) will support respectful boundaries, clear communication, and taking responsibility in the next breath. Similarly, telling someone to man-up is actually really unclear advice. What does that mean? What does one *do* if they actually want to man-up? A large percentage of the time, that evolves into ""Sit down and have an honest conversation about your feelings"" which, I think you'll agree, is a weird definition of ""man-up"". 

What I find is that gendered slurs usually are a short-hand for a complex and largely unconsidered pile of baggage that everyone means and understands in their own way. You can still call someone an asshole, a piece of shit, a cheater, a loathsome creature, an emotional terrorist. You can still say terribly mean things about people without using gendered slurs. You actually don't say much when you tell someone to man-up, quit being a pussy, stop being a fuckboy.

Abuse is an awful crime and we must take a more fair approach when deciding how we offer resources to victims.This is not to downplay any abuse suffered by women. And there are myriad platforms this is discussed in. My personal take is not to gender this issue and to deal with violence in general (yes we accept there are gender differences, in this case actually a lot so we act differently AS APPROPRIATE and ONLY WHERE NEEDED but we tackle the issue AS A WHOLE from the outset, using gendered laws and terms only when there is a good reason). However, this is not a commonly held view. For some dare I say almost all feminists, this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women. **This is not a ""feeling"" or a sentiment that you can deny by simply saying ""i don't so its not true, feminists do support men""** \- it is a cold hard fact, 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women as a result of where they have focused their attention in reality, biased policies and campaigns only focusing on women; multiple specific gendered domestic violence acts and laws yet always and exclsively for women alone.

The soloution: either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it with cold hard ACTUAL change/ lobbying/ campagning/ funding/ (not just ""yeah men can be victims too we care"") OR they need to allow MRA's to approach the issue without the constanst blocking/ banning/ no platforming MRAs who do receive.

1. Other points, is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states such as ""male assualts female"" which is a specific offence in some US states and commonwealth countries. Entirely uncessary, as it is covered under normal gender neutral law, and it makes no sesne why there should not be a ""female assualts male"" law or female assualts child and so on.
2. In countries such as Australia there are no mandatory courses abusers who are women who are domestic abusers on avoidin violence, yet there are for men against women. This is one of countless over sights and gendered centric approaches, that currently taget one gender only.
3. Either gender neutral violence acts (that of course leave room for even significantly different approaches to the genders, as it is very different) or specific acts that cover mens abuse, as there will be differences.

Prime strawman there. I can just as validly say that *all* people who care about men's or equal rights want women to be subservient maid slaves. Equally valid, in that it's not at all valid.

> either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it 

Many of them, if not most, do. They'd tell you this is all largely a facet of Toxic Masculinity, in which society dictates that men shouldn't seek help in the first place (or else they're weak little bitches), and to your other points, that if a domestic violence case is called in, they arrest the man regardless of the situation because man r strog.

Of course, when feminists say this is part of Toxic Masculinity, the brains on the men's rights side tend to turn off and instead focus on attacking feminism as a concept rather than, you know, actually trying to fix the issue.

Funnily enough, the few feminist who have agreed that toxic feminity exists again do not call it this, they blame it on the patriacrhy and at times call it internalised mysogony. If feminism continues to use such deregatory and bigoted terms such as toxic msaculinity, mansplaining, manterupting, etc then Karen, toxic feminity etc will inevitably also result, and we dont want either of these, yet currently we have it one way.

This is why it is very good that western feminists are not tackling issues in India or Saudia etc. (they wont anyway as it wil cause more probems for them, apart from say it is bad, but that is another debate) Anyway:

""There  are many ways that sexism harms women in india, there are also many  ways that the same sexism benifits women. There are also many ways in  which sexism specifically harms men, and in many ways that that same  sexism benifits them. To fix the issues in places like india, we need an  egilatrian approach, or we dont need a name for it just a global  approach that solves issues of both genders and not one way.... For  example in Saudia Arabia, it is not fair to allow women the right to  work but still keep the rule that womens personal income is solely for  her, and that a man is legally obliged to provide for her as well as the  social pressure to do so also. Also women cannot not keep the rule  where their money is solely theirs and not their husbands, and then  still expect larger inheritances. That kind of change is what (most)  feminists would do if they got involved (western ones wont anyway apart  from to talk about it), as they would only focus on womens issues such  as right to work, yet ignore obligation to be guaranteed finanicially  looked after. I am not speculating, similar things happened right from  1st wave feminism (and \[some\] feminists did this on purpose e.g. took  property that they acquired the legal right to but the MEN still had the  responsiblity of the tax for, and some men went to jail for not being  able to afford their wifes property, which they would still keep and  would not sell)""",0

3600,3601,"4 simple Activities/Habbits to develop during quarantine in order to transform yourself.Ive seen people talk about how during these times of uncertainty it is important to love and forgive yourself, to allow yourself to eat snacks and trash foods, to spend *(waste)* your time playing video games and binge watching shitty tv shows and Netflix series.

While I agree that its good to spend some time having fun and enjoying yourself, this is no excuse to let go and consume your free time. Instead, I **urge** you to **PRODUCE** instead of **CONSUME.**

1.	**WORK OUT** - Im hopeful that at least 90% of the active users of this sub have already developed and follow a work-out routine. This goes to the people that are not already working out and especially for those who have been working out and have stopped due to the lockdown. Just get yourself up and do it. It doesnt matter what you do, just go for a walk, a job, run, ride your bike, do some push-ups, burpees, bodyweight squats. There is an abundance of exercises you can do anywhere, anytime. Your gym being closed is NOT an excuse to sit on your couch and get fat while you play Call of Duty or something and eating oreos or other trash foods. 
Work out, your body will thank you, your mind will thank you. Working out relieves stress, improves your cardiovascular health, your immune system, as well as your body and mind altogether. If youre struggling to find a routine to follow during quarantine, feel free to shoot me a PM or Ill post a free home workout program here. 

2.	**Start cooking**  Cooking is fucking amazing. It is one of the most relaxing activities I do on a daily basis. Besides the fact that youre being creative and cooking your own meals which helps avoiding trash foods, snacks etc. It is also a perfect time to listen to an audiobook, a podcast or any other educational/self-improvement video/audio. I find myself being extremely focused when I cook and I absorb any information easily. If youre not into audiobooks/podcasts, just put your favorite tunes and vibe it out. But for real, start cooking your own meals, its great and its not as time consuming as you might think it is.

3.	**Educate yourself**  3 easy suggestions: 1) **Read books.** Any book that seems interesting to you, read it. TRP is the reason I now read books and it has insane benefits for the human brain. It helps me build focus, expand my vocabulary and gain knowledge on a wide spectrum of things (psychology, philosophy, business, finance). It started with The Rational Male and turned into Friedrich fucking Nietzsche and Ancient Greek philosophy. 2) **Take online classes.** There is an abundance of free online classes available. Hell, even watch youtube videos about something and take notes. Its 2020, education is available online and for free. I feel like a moron for wasting 6 years getting 2 university degrees. 3) **Watch documentaries/docuseries instead of TV shows.** Documentaries about anything, serial killers, abuse, gender equality (if you wanna get triggered). Anything is better than watching pointless TV shows. 

4.	**Develop new skill(s)**  On the same note as the above, try to improve yourself by developing a new skill. Two personal examples Im focusing right now are: Learning a new language and experimenting with investing/day trading. But this can be anything, a physical skill (learn how to handstand or smth), play an instrument, learn coding, cooking (see point 2.), fix things, build things, craft etc. Your future self will be glad youve taken the time to develop new skills.

5.	**Meditate**  Its important to train the mind as well. Take time to dose off, give your head some space. Relax and focus on your breathing and how your body feels. Remember that you are the essence living inside the body, so take care of the presence. Remind yourself of what is within and come to peace with it. It will greatly relieve your stress, anxiety, depression, as well as to improve your sleep and attitude in general.

**Epilogue:**

This is the perfect time to work on you. Improve you. Fix you. Transcend you. 

There is no excuse for being lazy, having terrible eating habbits and not taking care of yourself. Remember that one day things will go back to normal. You can be the guy who comes out of this completely transformed. Healthier, better looking, wiser, craftier and maybe even wealthier. 

Do you want to waste your life because there is a global pandemic? Do you wanna come out of this as a loser with no money, like a junkie who will seek cheap dopamine rushes and quick moments of fun? Or do you wanna come out like a stoic roman emperor, ready to take on the world again, fuck his way to the top, ready to make money, lift heavy weights and live life to the fullest?

3610,3611,"The Dual Mating Strategies of Men and WomenAlpha Fucks and Beta Bucks is a well documented phenomenon in the Red Pill. Its the so called dual mating strategy that describes a womans instinct to seek sexual opportunities from the alpha (Alpha Fucks) and provisioning opportunities from the beta (Beta Bucks.) It seems generally assumed in the sphere that this strategy is exclusive to women, so this will be my brief attempt to show that a dual mating strategy is also present in men.

Across the sphere we see RP men constantly admitting their dual mating strategies. We want to fuck hoes, and marry virgins (low n-counts.) We want a lady in the streets, and a freak in the sheets. Men seek sexual opportunities from the whores, and provisioning opportunities from the virgins. Sigmund Freud expressed this dual mating strategy in his Madonna/Whore Complex: the tendency in men to view any particular woman as either a Madonna or a Whore. Madonnas (dont think of the superstar by this same name, it will confuse you) are women we perceive as pure, submissive, obedient, and faithful. Whores are women we perceive as sluts, large n-count, tattoo-ridden, disobedient, and unfaithful. History is full of men who were in love with their Madonna wives, only to cheat on them with a Whore. In fact many RP players have made careers out of fucking hoes only to eventually marry a woman they perceive as a Madonna. We all carry this Madonna/Whore instinct inside of us, and its quite clearly a dual-mating strategy, if we care to admit it.

This dual-mating strategy for both men and women may be a result of pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution societies. The findings of evolutionary psychology suggest that before the Agricultural Revolution sex in humanity was far more polygamous, liberal and free. People tended to sleep around for various reasons without taboo or stigma. Theres a lot in our biology that is evidence of this. This doesnt mean a womans hypergamy wasnt in effect, it just means being a hoe wasnt looked down upon. If this is true its safe to assume that women were hoes for a very long period of time. And this would explain our natural attraction to hoes. Further, pre-Agricultural Revolution, there was no such thing as property, assets, and marriage.

Post-agricultural revolution introduced property, assets, and marriage, and this changed sexual relationships forever. People began to think heavily about guarantying their property and resources was passed on to their progeny. Men became interested in women who could guarantee this bequeathment, and women became interested in men who would share their resources. Suddenly virgins and beta men became more attractive. The forces of this new social pressure conditioned women to look for men who could provide provisioning (betas), and those same forces conditioned men to seek women who could be trusted with their resources (Madonnas.) Virgins can be trusted with property and assets more than whores, and beta men can be relied upon to share their resources more than alphas. In this hypothesis, a dual-mating strategy evolved in both men and women out of our ancient past of free and unbridled sex (pre-Agricultural Revolution) and the relatively recent development of commitment sex (post-Agricultural Revolution.)

In the RP theres this idea that you must maintain alpha-ness in your relationships at the expense of beta-ness, so that your wife doesnt cuck or leave you. While theres obvious truth to this, we should condition this view against our own dual mating strategy. In the life of a man, a virgin is perceived to be a prize. Sure, nothing turns us on more than a whore, and some married men will fuck them given the opportunity, but many wont. Many married men will stay faithful to their Madonna, even though she doesnt turn them on like a Whore. Understood in this way, we can see that while women may be attracted to Alphas, for them the prize might very well be a Beta. This is why we teach comfort tests. And while some women in relationships will still fuck the Alphas, many of them wont, and will stay faithful to their Beta. AF/BB is not a black and white line, its just an evolved tendency in women, just like the Madonna/Whore complex is an evolved tendency in men. But neither of these tendencies dictate with any certainty how a particular man or woman will act. This is not an excuse for a man to be a little bitch, a real RP man knows how to be both Alpha and Beta.

I admit that the theory of AF/BB and Madonna/Whore instincts evolving out of a pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution society might simply be conjecture. But, the evidence that men have a dual mating strategy (like women) is overwhelmingly evident and universal.",1

As tomes of RP posts and reports coming from direct experience would have told you by know, a woman's past does matter a lot. Even a guy like Roosh who had sex with hundreds of women when he retired admitted he'd only want women with zero or low n counts. A man who is sexually very successful is seen as extra attractive despite his reputation while a woman who is too loose is slut shamed or considered washed up especially after she's spent her prime years riding the CC. On Tinder it couldn't be more blatant that 80-90% of the women want to fuck the top 10% of men. A man who fails sexually is an object of ridicule by both women and other men while a woman who saves her body for the best man / men is appreciated for her taste. Instinctively our standards for men and women are opposites. 

While a feminine dominant society tries to shame men for taking her past into consideration, and shames men for the expectation of wanting either virgins or women with a low n count, while simultaneously encouraging her to be ""sexually liberated"", make ""her choice"" and on top of that later down the road, tries to convince a man that she has ""matured"" or is ""over it"" or ""now knows what she wants"" (lol the irony), we observe the actual scenario and know far better what's really up. Of course, there is always a set of women especially in more conservative countries who are 1-2 generations behind the current state of the West to try to play the ""I want a virgin too or a good man with a low n count card"" in the name of ""equal logic and equal standards"".

Whatever the strategy used by different societies, discussions of one's past bring up fierce debates on unfairness and equality. However life doesn't run on machine logic.

A man's past is a problem for him when it injures him deeply - either physically, or emotionally or mentally, and when he has neither the tools nor the awareness nor the frame to deal with it. If he doesn't find the tools, the results can be catastrophic. One only needs to look at what kind of shit men can land up into - violent crime, abusive relationships, suicides, drugs, alcohol -- and every one of this is due to past trauma that never found space and consciousness to heal.

To add to the challenge, men often do not have support systems, those whom he needs in his low moments ditch him for the good times and he is ridiculed for trying to seek help. Man is ridiculed for even saying he has a problem. Even in effective support systems meant to help him, he has to face at least 50 people all calling him a faggot for every mistake and has to earn his respect (MRP, I'm looking at you...and respect you). A man learns soon that there is no substitute for strength and being proactive.

Let's make the exception for lasting physical trauma. Soldiers who come back with PTSD and worse from wars have often been found to have suffered lasting brain injuries and lesions, which are responsible for the symptoms. Some people with an altered personality have been known to have had a brain tumor in a particular part of their brain. So, physical damage is the one thing a man might totally not recover from. But that hasn't stopped them from trying.

But when a man does have the tools and cultivates some awareness and frame, the mental and emotional scars can soon be overcome, and except severe injuries that caused permanent damage to the body, many injuries and diseases can also be fixed medically today. Everyone who has ever contributed to RP awareness has shared their own tools from their toolbox for this purpose (for those who ask). I too found some really powerful tools for me, which I have shared.

Once a man has somehow found the space he needs to make even a little peace with his past, his problem solving mind gets to work, learning lessons from the experience, developing a new mindset and approach, looking at what went wrong and how to improve his results. Recognizing that there is no support granted to him, but the need must still be addressed nevertheless, a man decides to create what is missing in life himself, walking the hard path. It is a long an arduous road to create what has not existed before.

If needed, man seeks out discomfort in planned doses, gains additional experiences, works on himself and gets better and better every time with each additional experience, every failure and success until he masters the challenges that once seemed impossible to him. As every rep he does stimulates more muscle to grow afterward, men simply improve with experience. Men use their past to attain mastery in the present. Man essentially runs on the paradigm **""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger""**. Of course let's be practical and add this line - **""Once he recovers from it. ""**

This is also and especially true for sex. A man who has embraced his sexuality gets better at the game with every experience.

A man once awakened, doesn't mind systematically annihilating his past dysfunctional self to become a more evolved being.

A bad past however has a much worse impact on a woman, given her much greater sensitivity. It creates a self perpetuating trauma pattern in her that keeps her locked in it. If her past was abusive, expect her to have a much greater tendency to pair up with the abusive assholes and suffer all her life, even if it means her children suffer at times. 10 minutes of sex god and she is alpha widowed for life and can't enjoy sex that way with other men again. 10 years of riding the cock carousel before settling down with a nice provider means it's only a matter of time before she gets bored with marriage and aspires for the thrill of the chase again  -- once unstable relationships, always unstable relationships. Or if she gets violated against her will, she can feel horrible, ashamed, dirty, even defiled and this can make it impossible for her to let go and enjoy herself with a future lover. There is no end to those complications and all the forms past unresolved emotions can take. 

**In matters involving any significant intensity of emotion, a woman essentially becomes the victim of her past pleasure and pain.**

Bitter experiences can force women to wear the pants, man up and step up to the challenges, especially if her mama mode is activated. But these usually leave her still scarred bitterly at the emotional level. A woman who has to wear the pants in the house invariably develops contempt for the man who doesn't. Behind every feminist champion, you can always find a woman emotionally scarred to some degree or the other.  Tough women especially carry boat loads of unresolved emotional pain. There are many such women who have manned up only to lose faith in men and carry bitterness and contempt towards men for not having the manliness that a woman was capable of summoning. 

Unresolved past sexual trauma can subconsciously force a woman to make herself unattractive and unhealthy, which is what we see in many feminists, as a way to avoid the possibility of a repeat of that experience and getting hurt again. By comparison, men who are hurt try to avoid relationships. 

The tendency of the feminine ego to seek refuge in the feeling of victim hood does not help in this - it helps keep her past alive in her. A bad past just gives the victim tendency a first class ticket.

The fact that women tend to be a herd animal with a significant collective hive mind component to their existence makes it worse. In one room, all that one woman has to do is to bring out her past emotions and you can be sure that within minutes, even seconds, that all the women are feeling the same thing. The impact of past experiences on a woman is simply deeper and bigger already due to their sensitive nature, and it only gets multiplied further by the collective pain body of the feminine.

We even see this any time she's in a bad mood -- they remember past miseries and mistakes in excruciating detail don't they? Not all of a woman's pain or emotion is hers alone, it's the pain and emotion of womankind.

Let's not even get started on bad habits. Women who get into drinking and drug abuse wreck their lives and the lives of their families and children in spectacularly horrible ways. And once it starts it becomes near impossible for them to stop. I see a lot of men in mrp in the OYS threads working on their addictions from alcohol to the smartphone and porn, but I don't get to see many woman come out of deep shit by themselves. They'll need help, if they are capable of being helped at that point that is.

While a man can get to enjoy the feeling of mastery at the end of his struggles and suffering and victory, a woman is still left with a bitter taste in her psyche and lots of unresolved pain even if she ends up succeeding. Even success doesn't seem to fill up a woman's emotional holes - you can see this with any successful woman who had to wear the pants to get there. There is some unhappiness in their tone, as though they regret the impact it had on their femininity. 

As for a history of crazy sexual behaviour, when I see the stories of many of these women, with notch counts that would have been impossible without contraception, their troubling past prior to that, along all the thoughts and emotions that these women admit to having over time swinging across the entire spectrum, and add the impact of powerful sexual memory on their system, all I can say is that it's a case of absolutely fucked up, both inside and out. The fuck up outside just reflects the fuck up on the inside, and makes it worse. The biggest mistake is to assume and believe what they say as if the impact of such powerful emotions and experiences can simply be wished away by rationalization. 

A lifetime spent running full throttle in one direction will never magically fix itself overnight. 

As I wrote in my post on the irony of ""Choice"", it is stupid to think you are choosing when your mind has this much grip over you. These women may claim they are over it, but deep down their minds are still in the same deep turmoil of thoughts and emotions as ever and they have never addressed that. That software runs freely on the inside, just hidden. That won't stay quiet for long. Sooner or later their unhappy selves are going to emerge for the next round of seeking salvation elsewhere, or they are going to go crazy. 

And that's why you should never listen to their claims that they've overcome their past. That as you will read below, requires exceptional work, the honesty to face oneself and take responsibility for once, and they should have clearly done it and have results to show for it. You cannot practice instability all your life and then hope to stay stable and committed one fine day. How in the world did men start believing that shit and even white knighting for it by any logic is beyond me.

So for all but the most spiritual of women, a woman essentially runs on the paradigm of being a victim of her past -- **""What doesn't kill her enslaves her"". Recovery? Oh God...**

Why I said all but the most spiritual women was that there are some women who do find tools to work on themselves, a few do end up recovering from their past experiences, but if you've ever read some of the books written by them on the subject, you can tell that the recovery process is a battle, involving massive emotional releases, moments of very altered moods and the like - it's like 4th of July. The key difficulty is that women being more emotional, find the way of awareness and inner peace inherently more difficult, and have a lot of extra pain to resolve. Usually devotion, service, nurturing others and emotional methods work much easier with them (which is why more women than men go seek religion). But it is not impossible, and the tools can also work extremely well with them.

In fact most of the tools will work on anyone who is serious about using them.

Trouble is, many of these women are too deep into the grip of their own past patterns to get to the start line even. It takes women years of work to get to a point where a lot of their traumatic patterns are dissolved and we're back on a clean slate, though by then, they might not even be physically in their prime. Biologically women have a shorter prime than men to bear healthy children and then be healthy enough to raise them to adulthood. Men on the other hand, can keep their physical and reproductive prime up for longer.

The task of ""annihilating their past unhappy self"" is therefore much harder for a woman and needs more work. A man would find it easier to help himself or recruit help where he doesn't find help by default, but women really do need far more hand holding when dealing with deep inner pain. Sometimes absolute dominance is probably the only way to force them to start to work on themselves.

Biologically a woman who has a bad past or a history of bad habits, or even a very stressed history has a much greater chance of hurting the physical and mental health of an unborn child. In old school societies, lots of care is taken to see to it that pregnant women are kept emotionally ""well fed"". Just a history of lots of stresses, irregular hours of food, diet and rest can damage their fertility and reproductive health. No one mentions the impact of abortions and contraception on reproductive health and hormonal balance. A woman's body is a significant biological investment, and men are biologically wired to be repelled by women with a history of destructive habits and behavior.

Do keep in mind though that a man's bad habits like smoking and drinking and sedentary living also damage his reproductive health and T levels, but again, good habits, lifting and diet can go a long long way to correcting this. Fitness also has equally positive effects on a woman's health, but most unhealthy women I tell you also come with a significant degree of mental and emotional illness and are too far in a hell hole to even turn up at the gym. **Most women who are unhealthy today are actually so because of an underlying emotional or mental problem, while most men are just plain lazy**. In my world, women will have to lift, do yogic practices and meditate. For their own good. I won't accept those not willing.

Amidst all this, anything a woman gains in technical skill from her sexual experiences can easily become irrelevant. Besides, a skilled man can always train a willing woman (go to mrp and see that latest post), leaving her free to concentrate on the seduction part of her game.

I honestly feel sadness and pity for many of these women whom I see, broken wrecks of what could have been. I couldn't stay cold about it if it happened to any of the women in my family or life, but honestly, they're doing it to themselves and save-a-hoe is just stupid -- the foolish nice guy who wants to save them and change them just gets swept into that shit and realizes too late that this is way beyond his power to solve, and he might not even be able to get out safely from crazy. 

In the case of woman and the impact of her past on her psyche, prevention was always far better than cure. Let's be real about that. That's why old societies were always so strict with their women. 

So in the end, a man's past can end up making him stronger and wiser and he can look back at it honestly without toxic shame, with a degree of pride and gratitude even -- as a very harsh teacher, but the one he needed, that taught him permanent lessons. Women on the other hand, are often left with permanent or lasting physical and psychological damage from their pasts far more than lessons learned. Men become responsible for themselves over their past, women become victims of their past.

**And that's why a man's past and a woman's past are simply not comparable.** We're not denying that men too get damaged from their past, but unless its a serious physical injury, it is indeed easier to recover from that and emerge stronger than it is for a woman. What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman tortures her for the rest of her life. And that is how it goes for all but the most exceptional cases.

*PS : When I used the word ""past"", it wasn't in the context of reputation, but past experiences. Now about reputation -- A woman's reputation did matter enormously in societies of the past, and I myself know that my grandmother would have preferred death to shame and loss of reputation. But in a feminine primary society, the sisterhood will defend her in public, encourage her in private and bitch about her behind her back. Yes, that last part is true.*

*A man's reputation however is everything, especially in this kind of society. It is more vulnerable than the most delicate and sensitive woman, and as easy to shatter as glass, and easier to damage forever. A woman will cast allegations on you, even and especially false ones if it benefits her, her sisters will vilify you as a monster, your rival men, her orbiters, and envious betas will rush to her aid, glad to see your downfall, the white knights and SJWs will attack you, and the justice system exists for the sole purpose of screwing you forever, you'll be abused and raped in prison hell, you're out of the job market, the feminist dominated media will write any shit on you if it sells, society treats you in ways they didn't treat slaves or untouchables, and your best hope is to actually STFU and fight to the end --* ***rape of a man is the rape of his reputation and freedom.*** *Once raped, it will never recover to the way it was formerly.* *Only God alone can save you if truth is on your side TBH. So remember Law #5 always --* ***So much depends on reputation, guard it with your life!***",0

I think a reputation in the other hand, hurts men more if he has a bad one. You never see a woman with ""sex offender"" on her criminal record. But a man (one of my friends actually) got charged with such, for doing NOTHING. False accusations and false witnesses who just wanted to get back at his family, ruined his life. 4 years of house arrest from 20 years old and on the sex offenders list.

So Ive been off of the TRP subs for close to a year now, as I spent most of 2018 reading, absorbing, and learning as much as possible. The last year was spent applying what Ive learned. 

No shocker here, but the results have been great. Success with women has been awesome, Ive built my own business, improved my physique and also replenished my finances.

Lately though Ive been feeling some anxiety and low level depression seep back in, so Ive restarted my therapy appointments.

With the TRP principles internalized, its hard for me to not speak about certain subjects and it comes out through a TRP perspective.

I can already tell that my (female) therapist thinks Im sexist or misogynistc. Pretty much any of the females in my life come to a similar conclusion and think Im an asshole, or evil.

Im not an autist with what Ive learned. I dont openly talk about TRP concepts or shove it in anyones face. But Ive internalized enough of it now to the point of its just who I am for the most part.

I dont try to manipulate anyone, make them feel like shit, or harm anyone. I try to be an all around good person, but yet Im still hearing these comments and seeing disgusting faces at my beliefs.

Really just looking for some wisdom to consider and chew on from you guys. Just to ground myself and reset.

There are more and more business, dating, lifestyle, and personal transformation gurus than ever before. Selling courses, counseling, and coaching at a heavy price. Most of these experts never sell anything original - it is just watered down concepts and advice sold in a new shiny wrapping. 

I have acquaintances that have bought into pick-up bootcamps, paying 1000 dollars for a weekend - none of them get any better results than the ones that learned through free content and forums on the internet. Some of them are still struggling on the same level they were a couple of years ago. 

I have a close friend that paid the same amount of money for a meditation course. Where he was given a special mantra. He later told me that he found the instructions and his personal mantra on the internet for free.

I paid 12 dollars for Roy Masters meditation audiobook Be Still And Know which you can find for free on YouTube.  

Realize your favorite self-development guru has learned from someone else above them - the real experts. You can learn from these originators at a fraction of the price your favorite guru wants you to pay.   

These self-proclaimed mentors often follow the same format. Many will have a YouTube account in order to generate, leads, traffic, and build up trust with their audience. This is done by giving away free value and content in order to establish their brand. 

Another side effect of giving away free content is that it leaves the potential client with thoughts such as - Well if all this great content is free, imagine what the paid product will do for my life

The truth is that the product being sold to you will likely contain the same information that you can buy as a book on Amazon for a few dollars instead of hundreds and thousands through an online course. 

The YouTube videos will contain a link to a landing page for the product steeped in marketing techniques such as scarcity marketing, big colorful buttons, and graphics. It will contain powerful statements such as:

* Live An Incredible Life...NOW
* Feel Unstoppable In Your Personal and Business Life
* Unleash your Authentic Self

You get the message - whats funny is once you have seen one landing page you have seen them all. Another strategy you will come across is the discrediting of the original source and author. 

Sure all these books and authors are great, but they dont teach you how to take practical steps - which I do

Even well-established success gurus such as Tony Robbins have had personal models. He learned about motivational speaking from Jim Rohn. He learned Neuro-Linguistic-Programming. A powerful system to change habits, emotions, and thoughts, from the co-founder John Grinder. 

He re-packaged NLP and incorporated it into his books and seminars. A Tony Robbins seminar called A Date With Destiny costs 2,000 dollars. 

Richard Bandlers NLP book Make Your Life Great costs 12 dollars. And will contain the same strategies and techniques that Tony Robbins teaches.

3657,3658,"Can't say I'm too surprised as it seems the same sort of phenomena seem in the past with academics on parental leave following the birth of a child, but also not sure about what to do with this.  Any thoughts?

As with many things, I'd expect a lot of proposed plans to be likely to fail to address the full range of incentives they might otherwise create.  e.g. if men are assumed not to be spending time while on leave or in quarantine doing the work of parents but rather doing research, any policy intended to address this issue would seem likely to strengthen incentives for men not to parent.

As the moment there's also a narrative of women's research contributions tending to be ignored, whereas in this case it seems to more openly acknowledge that the research simply isn't getting done due to competing time commitments for things like parenting.  I have a feeling that that will soon be forgotten again.

One trend that I'm also wondering about is household cleanliness and how quarantine might impact that.  Are people actually keeping their homes significantly more clean than in the past due to concerns over the pandemic, or might some levels of cleanliness be relaxed due to not having to worry about entertaining guests during this time?  (Am thinking here of women doing disproportionate housework, but perhaps also due in part to arguments that I've heard that women are held to higher standards for this - but perhaps from visitors rather than from their partners).",0

3666,3667,"How important IS vetting?Hey ladies, I just have a general question about vetting, and the importance of it. I have been reading and re-reading the Surrendered Wife in the past year and a half, as well as listening to Laura Doyle's podcasts. I just get confused because there's so much in her theories that makes it seem like nearly every marriage situation IS salvageable. She even came out to say that she now doesn't agree with the statements in her first book about not surrendering to men in specific situations, like for example addictions. I've read columns where she interviews women who have never even really respected their husbands from the beginning, and they most certainly didn't vet, BUT they applied the skills and they have transformed their marriages. It seems to me that here in this sub there's a lot of emphasis on proper vetting, and that if you don't do that you can't find a real captain and therefore you really can't or shouldn't submit. So, I'm just wondering if there's gray area with that? Doyle seems nearly totally convinced that any situation can be turned around. What do you all think?",0
3667,3668,"Even if it is true that any situation can be turned around, you can still make your life a lot easier by choosing a husband that is compatible with you, and that has the same needs, wishes and goals. 

I had a good long think about my relationship and my husband after he proposed. I had already said yes based on emotion, but wanted to really rationally think every aspect through. The fact that we have the same outlook on many things and can truly operate as a team has made our journey into marriage and especially parenthood much easier, compared to friends who were very much in love but not necessarily on the same page about a lot of things. 

I guess what I am saying is that everyone can climb the hill towards a good relationship, but vetting can make you start half way up instead of at the bottom.",0
3668,3669,Okay this is awesome thank you for a great reply!,0
3669,3670,"I married young, and I often reflect on how LUCKY I was/am to have married the man I did. We have our difficulties, everyone does. But on the fundamentals, we agree, and that's so, so helpful to our marriage as a whole. Knowing that we have the same views on marriage as an institution, on money and lifestyle, on religion, and on children makes everything easier - we are never arguing about those core elements.",0
3670,3671,"I'm not too familiar Laura Doyle, but as a ""thought leader"" in this space, she'd have to say her techniques generally work, wouldn't she? It's her brand and livelihood. It would be ackward to give examples of women for whom her advice didn't work! All self help experts should be taken with a grain (bag?) of salt.

In any case, the previous commenter makes a good case for vetting. I think Athol Kay (former RP blogger for men) wrote that a man's goal when picking a wife should be having the happiest family life possible, not marrying into problems and trying to rescue a woman. I'd say this applies to women as well.

Obviously, vetting isn't perfect...people change, you may not really know what a person is really like until a crisis hits post-marriage (job loss, serious illness, pandemic, heh). But marrying without vetting is potentially setting yourself up for trouble and a lot of painful work... especially if you have kids!",0

3672,3673,"There is grey area...if you just think about regular life in all situations without the red pill perspective, you will find a huge theme of personal growth in common human experiences.

If you think about friendships, employment, or relationships, there are always compromises and things you put up with sometimes this is real, and positive, and helps you maintain a long relationship when times are hard. Sometimes its toxic manipulation. 

But when something occurs that is so offensive to you that you realize youve been lying to yourself to maintain the peace. Then you snap, and its very painful. Plenty of divorces initiated from either party come from the straw that broke the camels back. 

As I said, this could be friendships, or even something like a sibilings relationship. You forgive, you accept, you think about the bigger picture, and then you snap (if the relationship is toxic)

It could be a job, so you rationalize that the pay is low, but its close, or they are lenient about you sick parent being frequently hospitalized, but your coworkers get offered more opportunities. Some of these things seem fair so you just reassure yourself with the positives, until one day you realized you wasted 5 years of your career, or opportunities to be more present with your children, with nothing to show for it. 

Relationships with men are the same. Yes, you should do the things that Laura Doyle speaks of with a man who DESERVES it. Thats the point of vetting. And seriously, ignoring addiction issues? Women who were stuck in loveless marriages with losers, mean spirited, addicted, cheating partners is what caused the feminist wave of the 60s and 70s. You can try and try and try to be a doormat, or pray, or forgive, but thats not a good relationship. Its not healthy for you. Its just convenient for him. 

The purpose of vetting is to find a man that will make your love easy, make your love flow naturally, and spontaneously, a life where conflict makes you feel protected and trustful, not fully responsible for just letting things slide under the rug. Find a man who is responsible, responsible for his own life, and respectful of the emotional support you will provide.

In the last weeks, you have probably stumbled upon some articles titled something like SELF-QUARANTINE : YOUR SURVIVAL GUIDE or HOW TO SURVIVE SELF-QUARANTINE and articles like these just elicit fear and anxiety among its readers. So Ive decided to take another approach, to change your perspective and encourage you to actually enjoy the remaining days of your self-quarantine.

First and to ease your mind, allow me to point out that once you look beyond the fear and anxiety, you will understand that there is an expiration date. You dont know when, but you know there is one. That alone will give you the strength to endure. This is the power of impermanence.

I know as youre going through it, it might not seem that way as theres a natural human inclination to think that whatever is going on is the way its always going to be. Obviously, thats not the case. This will be over again. It might be a few weeks, it might be a few months but it is going to end.

Allow me also to point out that you currently have one incredible asset in your possession that most people usually dont have in their lives which is time.  
Time is maybe the one asset in life you cant replace and we spend it usually running around going paycheck to paycheck hustling and bustling We have a period now where we dont have a choice but to have some time. Were stuck at home and that is actually an incredible opportunity.

I am going to list a lot of action steps that I consider very important so you can choose the ones youre interested in and focus on them.

The idea is to get you doing those things and do as much relaxation or entertainment as you want. That will be your reward! Whats important is that you enjoy your reward.

Lets get right to it...

&#x200B;

#### Be kind

Take 15 minutes from your day to call your grandparents or anyone you know who is especially at risk of complications from the virus.  
Check in on elderly neighbors you know (while keeping your distance). If they need supplies and feel unsafe going to the store, offer to go for them; or just give them a call to see how they are doing. And if you order something to your house, like pizza, generously tip the delivery guy.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Physically)

This is not a health pandemic. So please please please stay healthy!  
Dont get fat, keep eating well : get your fruits and vegetables. Take Vitamin D by getting some sunlight.  
This is a great moment to establish healthy routines by changing our diet and incorporating better nutrients into it.

Its also a great time to catch up on your sleep and let your body figure out your own personal circadian rhythm.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Mentally)

You can safely go outside while avoiding close contact with other people and touching surfaces that may be infected, and sometimes, this is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Soaking up sunshine and breathing fresh air will help rejuvenate you and make you feel better.  
You can also practice your walking past a stranger awkward smile you know the one

Weve all tried time and time again to get into a meditation routine, but there always seems to be something (like life, yknow!) that gets in the way. Well, now that many of us are staying home during the day we have the perfect chance to follow through on making this a new habit.

Another habit you can practice is self-care. It is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind healthy and happy. And self-care is imperative to stress management.  
And yes, for the guys reading this, its okay to practice some form of self-care. Its not exclusive to girls.

&#x200B;

#### Stay fit

No gym? No problem! We are creatures of habit and as such we get used to our daily routines and rituals. This is a great time to try and challenge yourself in other ways.  
Try a new fitness app. Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do squats in your room whatever you have to do. The important thing is that you keep moving, get your blood pumping and sweat as much as you can. This will benefit your mind and body equally.

&#x200B;

#### Read and study

One of the most amazing resources we have as human beings is the fact that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We dont have to relearn everything from scratch we dont have to figure everything out, almost everything you want to learn has been written down somewhere, its been put into a course by somebody or into a very good self-improvement blog (wink wink) so take advantage of this time to read a good book or study a subject that youve been wanting to study.

&#x200B;

#### Stay connected

Remember the phone? A long time ago it was used for a lot more than just texting and Instagram. Pick it up and call a parent, friend, or co worker. FaceTime with your friends. Improve your relationship with your family.  
Its important to keep working on your social skills, dont get rusty in that area and dont go into this depressive isolated place. This is actually in some ways an opportunity to bridge new social connections or to deepen the social connections you already have.

&#x200B;

#### Start your passion project

Not everyone is lucky enough to call their career or job their passion, but everyone has a passion. Maybe you want to start a home bakery or maybe you want to start your entrepreneurial adventure, theres really no better time than when youre sitting around doing nothing to get that in place and get that started.

You dont have to complete whatever project you start in the amount of time we are on lockdown, but you can definitely get the ball rolling and really create some momentum that would allow you to finish it soon.

&#x200B;

#### Learn a new skill

The business world is rapidly changing and new skills are needed constantly, but it can be nearly impossible to learn something new while youre just trying to keep your head above water at work. So take that online coding class, practice your video editing skills, or start learning a foreign language now. Imagine the surprise on your co-workers faces when you return from this hiatus speaking German!

There are lots of ways to teach yourself, with blogs, apps and online courses at your fingertips. If you learn a useful skill while away from the office, you will return to what may be a difficult job market with a leg up on your competition.",0

3688,3689,"Why is the ""Women only like jerks"" thing prevalent or at the very least not applied back?So I've been thinking about this for a bit.  Incels and some better men down on their luck, or guys who dont know better make the comment of ""Girls only like jerks"".  

Now I've thought about this and probably at one point agreed with it without thinking too much.  It's a thing in popular media and sometimes guys who seem like pricks have girlfriends and every wife beater has to have gotten a wife at some point (or else it's just assault).  Doesnt help that I watched a video by (Screamo?  Streamo?  Some variation of that I think it had an exclamation point, he interviewed the republican gun lobbyist who survived a school shooting) that literally had women calling him a jerk and a fuck boy but still saying they'd fuck him (I pulled one bit of salvageable advice out of that but that's another question)

But I've realized a few things (please poke holes if you can)

A) that implies monolithism (which not being that makes it really hard to discuss issues).  I've met some girls who would absolutely not tolerate dickishness

B)  Could be other features.  Most dicks are to some degree at least confident or driven so those are good qualities

C) most guys that say this aren't really guys I'd like to hang out with or classify as nice

But perhaps more importantly, 

D) guys do it too.


There is this thing that I think is just as prevalent in media about a dude defrosting an ice queen for lack of a better word (is that term sexist?  I think it is but languages fails me as I cannot think of a suitable replacement for the platonic ideal).


The women would undoubtedly be a jerk (why does that sound masculine?), or at the very least cold and unemotional.  Through out the movie (using a fictional example here) the hero would defrost her via kindness, witticism or heroism.  And they'd get together.  Now she doesn't necessarily have to be mean but definitely more business and aloof.  Or turning it

In real life I think its definitely a fantasy of most men for the same reasons above.  I know I personally have had crushes on girls who were not the kindest in their interactions with people (or at the very least attraction whether they were just genuinely attractive and my brain ignored the other parts or there ""badness"" made them more attractive).  



Point is that it's a phenomena and something I have personally experienced so I guess ""Guys like bad girls?"".  Not monolithic but it is to my knowledge a thing?


So why is it not generally levied in reverse?  Am I way off on my assumption and this is more a me thing?  Is it patriarchy?  Doe femcels not use this language?  Does if have to do with framing like the most attractive women is the evil one or they are made more attractive through framing?

Please correct me if I'm wrong.",0
3689,3690,"What I believe to be going on here is you have noticed how the media grabs the attention of people, largely young and immature that dont have developed emotions, portray romantic situations. When we are young and the person we like has a boyfriend or girlfriend, we often think of the other as a bad person so we arent guilty for wanting someone that is committed/involved/seeing to someone else, especially when we arent getting any attention. When media targets this audience, they portray this situation to be true, affirming the viewers feeling of their interests partner as a dick. We love feeling right. While this is largely portrayed as a young man having interest in a girl whos ex or partner is a dick (Scott pilgrim vs the world for example), it is portrayed both ways. Often, the love interest male is dating a pretty girl that isnt right for him (Im looking at you Taylor swift in you belong with me). Essentially, it is hoping that the audience watches this to affirm their feelings, so they consume the rest of the medium (movie, album, etc). It reflects a me not we mentality when it comes to love. The subject in both gendered roles is only thinking about what they want, disregarding the other person of interests choice in their actual partner. I studied what love actually is using a lot of philosophical backing, and I can say with confidence this is more possession than it is love, which is what we feel in our high school days and thats fine. Many young people confuse the two, as long as our life experience enable us to move on and exist with self love and eventual outward love. In short, its a product of immaturity more than sexism, but sexism can definitely spin this situation into something else when it comes to relationships. All that being said, people dont always choose people that are good for them. No one is perfect theres a very interesting psychological theory that analyses the people we find appealing romantically, and how it relates to our past. People are likely to date those that give us familiar types of suffering as opposed to those that show us new types. For example, if your parents always yelled at you and 
You never got over it, you would date someone that yelled to communicate adversity. Same thing with passive aggression, violence, and communication. We choose the familiar, unless we actively take steps to avoid it. And when someone we want to date chooses someone who gives them the suffering they are used to, it justifies the feelings I previously discussed EVEN MORE. (Heres a really cool video on the suffering bit, its far from hard science but is a really interesting theory on relationship dynamics as it relates to developmental psychology: https://youtu.be/Hvysy11716g). To summarize, love triangles are common and no one thinks wow my love interest didnt choose me, but thats fine! Until they love themselves.

Edit: had to change the Taylor swift song to the one I was thinking of, and added the part about relationship dynamics",0
3690,3691,"Wow I did not the love triangle bit at all from that video but I think I got the gist of the point.

3692,3693,"I've never really thought much about this, but I do feel like you have a point. 

Made me think of pretty much any big ""alpha"" male movie character or star. James Bond. Bruce Wayne. All the Pacino, Eastwood, Cruise, Hardy, Bale, Pitt, and a couple of DiCaprio and Gosling characters. Their characters are typically men of few words. Confident. Stoic. Smooth. Stylish. Guys like these can probably have any girl they want, but there is a common trope in movies that they will try to win over the girl who was initially cold to them. James Bond is actually the perfect example now that I think about it. Has less to do with the girl (or guy) itself and more to do with the ""chase"" of winning him or her over. I think another difference is that with girls there's a trope of them wanting to ""fix broken men"" that may be connected to the trope of ""girls like jerks"" but honestly idk. 

However, I think a key point is that most movies and media are usually not a good demonstration of how relationships work irl at all. But there's a distinction to be made. The trope isn't that guys and girls are into people that treat them like shit. The trope is that guy and girls are into people that give them the cold shoulder. Does this make someone a ""jerk""? Not really. 

I've definitely known guys who have straight up told me that they initially treat high-self esteem girls like shit to get them to sleep with them and it actually works. But there's a high level of confidence and nuance people need to pull shit like this off. Albeit, guys like this go through relationships like professors go through dry erase markers so this really isn't the best way to go about finding a meaningful and healthy relationship. 

But yeah, now that you mention it I do see how it works both ways.",0
3693,3694,"Women dont only like jerks. 

Some women date jerks, for multiple possible reasons - as you say, because of other good qualities they have, because the woman has low self-esteem etc. 

Some men date women who are jerks too.

Its not applied back/talked about in the same way because we dont live in an equal world. Men have been taught they are entitled to women. Now women are finally empowered to reject men on equal terms, and many men fucking hate it. We dont currently have a big female incel culture roaming the internet. 

Theres probably also something in this about how a man who is a jerk doesnt have to worry about letting his jerk flag fly - whereas women are still shaking off conditioning that says they should put a mans needs first and hide their feelings to benefit his. Its easier for a man to do almost anything - including be a jerk.",0

3696,3697,"I think the other version of this is men are attracted to crazy women, though its not nearly as ubiquitous as women only like jerks. Have you seen the crazy vs hot matrix? A friend showed it to me on YouTube. It seems to be widely accepted that a little crazy makes a woman more attractive and interesting, though in reality its not actual crazy so much as it is lack of boundaries or healthy lifestyle that is considered desirable, i.e. habits that are more likely to give men an opportunity to achieve their sexual goals, like a willingness to get loaded and have a threesome. 

However, I think that most people who believe the women only like jerks trope forget that a great many relationships start with people presenting their best selves rather than their real personality with all of its faults. So though it may seem obvious to an outsider that the men are jerks, it may not have been obvious to the women until they were already invested in the relationship.",0
3697,3698,"Also, I feel like ""crazy"" implies more fault on the side of the woman. Who ever knows someone is ""crazy"" from the first meeting? It also runs into that stereotype as women as nags, women as demanding etc., and that age-old idea of women as this inconceivable 'mystery' to men.

I feel like the whole ""women only date jerks"" narrative also puts the blame all on the woman too. As in, the idea it's a matter of woman's poor judgement that jerks get dates, rather than jerks shouldn't be jerks. I don't really know if there's an equivalent for men because I feel like even the ""men date crazy women"" narrative often comes down to blaming the women over the men who are dating them, when it is often the woman still blamed by the people judging women who date ""jerks.""",0
3698,3699,Wool Vs Cotton (T-Shirt and Other Clothing Performance),0
3699,3700,"Yeah but here's the thing. For $120 I can buy myself 13 stretch cotton-poly plain tees from Walmart, which look and feel nice. If it starts to feel or smell gross I can just change into another one, and I can do that up to 13 times in a day (unlikely but still) before I lose the benefit of buying cheaper. Plus I can just put them in the wash without thinking.

My opinion is that high end tees really only have two purposes:

1. Ultra premium high thread count fabric means you're looking really fly at an event.
2. You're camping/hiking and so the properties of wool become a huge benefit.

Notice how neither of those purposes include everyday use. Tees are thin, and also you wear them every day. That's a recipe for disaster that's going to end up with holes, stains, rips, etc. Which are you more comfortable trashing because of this? A $120 shirt, or a $9 shirt?",0
3700,3701,"Fair point! I do have a few merino shirts, which I got on sale and if you take care of them (wash warm, no softeners, hang dry) they last a while. I like wearing them biking around, skiing, underneath dress shirts, travelling on a plane or long distance and other instances I will be sweating but cant change right away. I dont wear them for soccer, basketball or at the gym because theyll get too sweaty and used up. But your point stands, cotton are way cheaper and more disposable.",0
3701,3702,"But a wool shirt wont tear or smell, and you really dont have to wash it much even if it gets stains in, and when you do you probably gotta take it to dry cleaners just to maintain the quality and not damage it over long term.",0
3702,3703,"Former textiles guy here. Generally what this says about wool/cotton/poly is true but many caveats.

**Poly doesnt absorb**- true the material itself doesnt absorb, but youll notice most sportswear  worm when youre sweaty is poly. Why?  Because you can extrude the thread in high-surface area threads break up surface tension or hollow threads that use capillary action to which away.  (Imagine the play dough machine squeezing out a  macaroni shape vs a star shape noodle, the star shape will wick better.  Poly is also quicker to dry because it doesnt hold onto the water due to absorption.  

Poly is also more durable.  This is because the fibers are smoother and dont create the self-abrasive friction that wears down yarns as much as other fibers.  Wool & cotton are both rough under a microscope.

**Cotton comparison vs wool.** - there are several types of cotton on the market.  The 2 main differences in the material are 1) fineness and 2) long staple vs short staple.  The construction also contributes to feel and utility greatly, but  t-shirts are usually a type of knit (vs weave)

The video covers Fineness a bit.  In addition to contributing to hand feel it also improves color-fastness. This is because the ratio of surface area to fiber thickness is high and the dye can more fully saturate.

Staple length:  the cotton staple is the fiber and different varieties have different lengths.  These fibers are twisted together to create a yarn (thread) and then it is knitted into your shirt. Long staple fibers can be tangled better because they can twist around each other more times. This means 1) you can get finer yarns. And 2) you have less hairs poking out of the yarn as there are less fiber ends to create the yarn.  Both contribute to the smoothness of the yarn.  Smoother yarn has better hand feel. This height number of tangles also means the yarn strength is better AND the smoother yarn means more durable than cheaper yarns (as with poly) Types of long staple yarn are Pima, Supima, sea island and Egyptian (high caution on Egyptian as there has been a lot of fraud there). In my opinion supima is the best, its the same species as pima but better growing methods and its guaranteed USA grown, so better oversight. 

Low staple cotton is generally lower quality crop with less certifications, so it is cheaper.

**recommendations**

If youre going to get a wool/cotton blend shit, my recommendation is merino/supima blend

If you want the best 100% cotton shirt: supima cotton

For a cheaper option that is more durable and has wicking and anti wrinkle properties, look for cotton/poly blends.  Ratios of 60/40 or 70/30.  Again my preference would be for supima/poly blend but in general the poly will make the cotton feel softer.",0

&#x200B;

Lets take one issues affecting men and specifcally see what feminism (organisations not just random individuals) had to say about it. I have direct statements and policies from the feminisnt organisations. See below.

So Norway has  forced male only conscription:

1. the ultimate form of slaverly, where men, regardless of their moral background or personality are forced to learn how to kill or face prison.
2. This is one of the biggest manifestations of gynocynetsicm in society and of course proof that the hypothesis of patriarchy is as robust as modern flat earth theory. Yes men create systems to benefit men by getting men to do all the dangerous and hard things (93% of work deaths, and here the milatry)
3. Many countries need conscription as voluntary private armies are too expensive for the nation. So it is needed. Of course the feminists know this and only want men to do it. Feminists when questioned often pay lip service, and say ""yeah we support no draft, but if there is a draft women should do it too"", as they know it wont happen.. erm until it does. Norway passes both gender conscrtiption. Lets see what feminists flip flopped when shit it did happen:

Firstly one party voted against it in parliment. Many of Noways feminists organisations (NKF, IAW, WILPF) were viciously against it

Please edit, modify, add as appropriate, maybe correct some grammar! Also the key distinction here, is that this is not random feminists, this is the actual feminist organisations of the country where conscription was made gender neutral (its still isn't men are still doing most of it) and one party voted it down. The key difference is the odd feminists may say yeah we oppose consrciption, and if it does exists we should make it both sexes... knowing full well it wont happen and they wont campaign for it.... when it does happen .... OH SHIT, lets change our tune... also",0

3728,3729,"Good you think that as an individual, however, the point is that feminism as a movement doesn't. It also actively stops any progress for womens rights and mens rights that doesnt suit their agenda.

When feminists authors did studie about domestic violence and were shocked to find out in some categories such as one way patner violence, i.e. not reciprocal women are 70% prepatrators, they received death and rape threats.

If men are already the main danger to women and service is mandatory, then having only men do it actively REDUCES the safety of women in society, since now men are not only physically stronger and much fitter due to having spent several months if not years working on physical fitness, they're also trained in how to control, subdue, and even kill people.

This only leaves one conclusion. Mandatory service only for women, for their own safety!^^^^^^/s",0

Well, there's an easy solution to that: women who bear and nurse children are exempt from conscription. Women who are medically infertile or who aren't pregnant by a certain cutoff age are conscripted. You have a duty to your country that you can fulfill in one of two ways. One of those options isn't available to many people, so you should consider yourself lucky if you do have it. I don't see how anyone could disagree with that.",0

3738,3739,"They say they love a relationship with an independent strong woman (aka I have my own life and my own career I focus on a lot), but everyone who I have dated, who loved that about me at the start, always went one of two ways:

1. They actually don't want an independent strong woman but rather a woman who they can control. They don't like that they aren't always the only thing I care about in this world.
2. They never would go on to the next step or never would grow up - they always wanted to stay in sort of ""completely committed bachelor mode"" as I sort of like to call it. Wanna buy a house? Nah. Wanna move in? Maybe. Do you love me? I want to marry you. Would you ever actually propose we have been together for 4 years? Idk.

So I have come to believe that men really just want women that either completely submit or women who aren't all about 'furthering' themselves in life - rather just have a woman who works, comes home, and hangs out and nothing else (depending on what kinda guy they are - crazy or chill). I always seeing them saying they want the independent strong woman, but I truly believe 99% of men don't actually want this - they want the illusion, the fantasy they sell themselves of this woman.",0

I am a secure man (think Christian red pill) and I fully support my wife finishing her education and both her current, as well as future proposed career, among other things including helping her learn anything she wants, getting hobbies, and having self-care time (as Laura Doyle mentions is so critical).  I was not hesitant about any of the things you mention, but that is because I largely knew what I wanted and I was pursuing real love, not lust, or just friendship with benefits or something.

The biblical Proverbs 31 woman is so capable she works to sell things and even buys property.  But the key is - everything she does is part of her household team with her husband and under his authority.  It clearly talks about how her husband can hold an esteemed position because she is truly his helper, she supports him so he can function at a higher level.  Wow, I would love to have this type of support!
Can men abuse their authority? Definitely.  Can women be just as abusive like that or in other ways?  Definitely.  So again, it comes down to each person's individual heart - what they truly believe in and live out.  And I agree with the comments that it is an utter shame that most of us are not taught these key concepts, both men and women.  There are so many opportunities in our childhood and teen years to teach them.  My children will not grow up in ignorance and they and their future spouses will greatly benefit from that.",0

3769,3770,">FDS does get some criticism (as it does here), but compare how much criticism TRP gets.

Is it because TRP has 25 time the number of subscribers and has been around for 6 times as long?",0
3770,3771,"FDS doesnt advocate for casual hookups like TRP does, nor does FDS make blanket AWALT/AMALT statements that TRP does. They're similar in that they're strict, but ones for getting sex and the other is for weeding out those using them for sex to find a ltr.",0
3771,3772,"CMV: Social distancing will be apocalyptic for the dating lives of the 80%, and will cement hookup apps as the primary way sex happens and new relationships start.So first, two things that I'm sure everyone here on this sub agrees on:

1. OLD and hookup apps are heavily biased in favor of women and very physically attractive men. 

2. For men not in the top 20% genetically as far as looks go, meeting in person at a bar or party or other social venue is their best bet at pursuing women and giving themselves a chance to act attractively in a way that cannot be shown easily through an OLD profile. 

Well, now we are living in a time where it is unclear if bars or concert venues or even restaurants will ever return to the way they once were. Even when these establishments open back up its guaranteed that they will have to do so while observing social distancing protocols, limiting the number of patrons and perhaps even the kinds of interactions patrons can have. 

Basically, almost every single kind of public socializing venue is going to either close permanently or see up to 50% cuts in patronage and profitability, enforced either legally by public health officials, or emerging naturally because people will just be too spooked to go out in large crowds, probably for the foreseeable future. 

So what's going to happen to dating?

People will obviously still need to meet up and have sex, so workarounds will be found. Online dating already accounts for almost half of new relationships, and I think its pretty clear that this trend will accelerate in post pandemic Western society. I can easily see a future where people are posting negative COVID results on their profiles and going about meeting new sex partners privately, rather than risking going into public and exposing oneself to potentially thousands of unverified disease vectors. 

And, of course, for already naturally risk-averse women, anything less than Chad is now completely not worth the risk. 

So, take away billy beta's one way of appearing attractive to new women and up the risks of meeting anyone new such that only the Chadliest are worth the effort for women, and, well...

That 30% sexlessness rate for young men is going to spike *hard* in the next two years.",1

3781,3782,"How do you dress breastfeeding boobs?I'm struggling with my postpartum body. I've pretty much lost all the pregnancy weight, but the weight was never the issue. My boobs grew like two cups sizes and I *hate* them. None of my light, flowy blouses fit. None of my bras. I've got a handful of shirts I'm surviving in and like three bras that actually fit...

What's worse, is most of my clothes thst do fit don't fit them right. I'm top heavy. And I can't wear any tight or supportive bras while I'm breastfeeding. And I actually breastfeed via exclusive pumping, so being able to access both to put on a pumping bra is a necessity.

And my husband finally has some time to help me with my intense nine month old and all the stores I would normally go to are closed. We are students, so I don't have a ton of money to spend. Amazon is a favorite.

So, all that being said, any words of wisdom or links to pumping friendly giant boob clothing? I'm finding that alot of cute, fitted dresses would fit my bust but be loose everywhere else. It's hard enough being a mom to an intense, high needs nine month old with medical issues, adding in that none of my clothes fit right and she needs to be outside everyday, it's all taking such a big toll!

First, wrap shirts if youre looking for a shirt and pant combo. Theyre easily accessible and look nice with a top heavy figure imo. 

I like to wear dresses, so Ive been wearing the cami dresses from old navy and gap. The tops are adjustable so I loosen them up and slip an arm out when I need to nurse. The tops are also lined so I can get away with not wearing bras with them, even with white ones. I like the midi style cause I feel like theyre more functional while doing housework, but they have shorter ones too. 

As far as bras go when I want a real bra while Im going out and dont have to constantly pull my boobs out I wear a Demi bra from Victoria secret. All other times, which is most of the time, I wear a bralette. They surprisingly give me a pretty good amount of support. I also just found wireless push-up bras from aerie and Im excited to try those out. I hate feeling floppy but also hate underwire when Im breastfeeding. 

Cant think of anything else right now, but if I do Ill let you know. Excited to see what other people suggest too cause I feel like Im in a never ending cycle of breastfeeding lol.",0

3806,3807,"Own Your Shit Weekly - April 21, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

Plan: Re-assess my current wardrobe. Find and throw away anything with a hole in it or fading in color.

Buy shirts, slacks, jeans, etc. that better align with my coming image of how I see myself. (Will be ongoing). Buy some more jewelry. Im a big fan of wrist wear, but only have a MVMT watch and a bracelet thats long overdue for replacing.

NMMNG (BF activities)

Career/Work:

Sticking to the plan. Studying, networking, and looking for/creating opportunities. I've broadened my thinking on this, however, and realized my goals here were quite superficial. I am looking into meaningful work that will satisfy me, and enable me to live the life I want to live. 

This week:

*Im shortening these up, so I may leave out a lot of detail. If anything catches your eye, just reply.*

So, I had a fight with wife. It was all my fault. I was frustrated about some shit she had said, and took it out on her the next day. Yes, passive aggressive and weak. Id like to focus on some takeaways from the experience:

1. My wife pointed out that she had been going to bed early, because she knew that I would justpursue sex. (This is what she did) My takeaway: Im boring and predictable. I alsoforce the sexual experience instead of letting it unfold (as mentioned in NMMNG and TWOTSM).  
2. (Next day) I told her that she could leave if she didnt want to participate as a family. She left and came back multiple times that day. Hysterical each time. I told her I wanted her gone, and to go take a walk for a few hours.My takeaway/actions: I acted like a bitch by giving her an ultimatum. What I mean by this is that I should not have to coax and threaten someone into doing something I want them to doespecially when it comes to participating in my family. My wife is showing me that I am not where I \*thought\* I was with my own mentality. She did threaten divorce, and I called her on her bluff. So, I may bengaf, but I still have a ways to go with frame.
3. I have backed off. I had a covert contract with myself. Half covert contract, half pride and ownership. I was still looking for approval from mommy, and it was showing up in other areas.  

I reset and have reevaluated wtf I was doing and how I was going about it.  I realize that, despite me getting stronger, trying to be more awesome and happy, etc. I was just, slowly, building a covert contract. I didnt have a complete meltdown and light the dynamite, but (almost)everything I was doing was for the wrong reasons despite my good intentions.

Action Plan: Okay, so Im reading sidebar, Im lifting, and Im STFU. Im a whole lot better than I was when I started, but Im still a shithead faggot, eating paint.

1. I am realizing I will fail at this shit, and thats okay. Whats important is to learn and keep pushing forward. I wanted to dump my whole marriage this passed weekend, but that wouldve been the easy way out. Keep pushing.  
2. Learn from these experiences. As David Deida says, What is my woman trying to teach me here? What can I learn from the feminine? How can I find my more masculine source, (who the fuck I really am) through my life experiences with my woman, career, world, etc.?
3. Lead myself first, please myself first. My needs come first.

**Kids:**

My middle son is a mommys boy. My fault. I have not spent enough time with him, giving him the attention and love he deserves. This (probably) explains why he sucks his thumb, insists on sleeping next to mom, and defers to her authority. Ive backed off of using my forceful way of getting him to do what I want him to do. In a lot of ways, Ive used similar tactics with my wife, on him (ultimatums, threats, etc.)  well, the shit doesnt work.  


**Further thoughts:**  


>Further thoughts:I'm finding less and less 'shit' to own. ~~Maybe I'm not looking hard enough?~~

**I wasnt. This hole Im in is deeper than I thought.**

Im working on my mission now and getting back into my masculine by meditating and asking myself what I truly want from life, irrespective of family and expectations held by family members.

Im digging deep and trying to get to the bottom of the question of Who am I.

I see my woman as a representation of the feminine. As such, I have a lot to learn from her and learn about myself as I interact with her moods. I will dance with the feminine instead of seeking to control it.

Hygiene: I had already been brushing my teeth, washing my face, feet, and ass before finding MRP. I have now cleaned my living space and am going to keep it organized and orderly, I let things pile up over the last few weeks while I've been prioritizing work and fucking around with girls 

###Mental

If I don't put me and my responsibilities first I will end up right back where I started, possibly in a worse place. It needs to be where I'm not chasing pussy, pussy is chasing me, and I give it the time of day on my terms and on my time, when my shit has actually been owned, and I have time to spare that I want to spend enjoying the company of a woman worth my time.

The external validation is like meth, extremely addictive, and it had been so long since I've felt a woman's interest, it was like being a first time user. In some ways I really am. On some level I knew all this, yet was weak over the last 2 weeks and indulged anyway. I'm coming down off of the validation binge now, and settling into what I said I needed to do last OYS: a more manageable amount of time spent on plating. I'll continue to step down my time commitment over the coming weeks, and continue working on identifying when I'm interacting for their validation (don't do it) and when I'm interacting for my own enjoyment and giving my time freely without expecting something back. 

###Family

Still not spending as much time as I was here before plating, makes sense, you can only do one thing with your time at any given moment, I can't read 48LOP as a bedtime story to my 3yo, nor can I be at home with my kids if I'm out on a date, or at work, etc. 

###Financial

Saving a lot. Stimulus came in, saving that too. 

Bought some new clothes in prep for Style week of 60DoD, this should finish out the cycling of my wardrobe that I've done over the last 6 months, it will be piecemeal from now on, cleaning out old/stained things and replacing those with new ones. 

###Professional

My temporary assignment is nearly over, and the permanent promotions needed to free up that position for me haven't happened yet. They did extend me in this position though, another month. No matter what I'm in so much of a better position to take the next similar opening that its not even funny. I killed it over the last 3 months and everyone, I mean everyone, knows it. 

###Social

Been having fun on my dates. 

Fucked Property Manager again, this time without the Nice Guy backdrop - I just did what I wanted, came, and that was that. Didn't worry about her at all. Spent a total of an hour at her place? Doesn't really matter. I wanted to fuck, so I did. 

Date 2 with Nurse is tomorrow. She said maybe at first, so I asked the next day ""is it a yes for you, or should I put that time back out on the market?"" Her ""Woooow, you are cut throat"" I said, my free time is valuable to me, we can hang out next week if it isn't good for you, just don't leave me in limbo. She said ""Got it"" and agreed to the date. We are doing a private Happy Hour at a secluded spot I picked out. 

Date 2 with Diver is a maybe, this one is a good learning opportunity for me, she's super assertive and independent, and I'm sometimes not sure how to respond because of it. She talked so much that I don't have to say much. We agreed to a plan, and when I texted to confirm the day before, she reneged but offered to reschedule to the next day. So I told her to come up with the idea, and once she had decided and suggested it I put a plan together to make it worth my time and fun for me and gave her a part in it. That plan she followed my lead and completed her assigned part quite well. Internally I focused on not reacting to her having so casually altered agreed on plans and staying positive and fun instead of getting offended like a faggot that she didn't do what I wanted when I wanted.

Date 2 with Physical Therapist is a maybe. She's smart but kind of full of herself, maybe takes herself a little too seriously. 

Date 1 with Server who shit tested is later this week. 

Out of the 4 I like Nurse and Phys the best, they are the most fun to be with, but I'm keeping the pipeline moving. Lining up 4 more girls, but not taking so much time with any of them as I did the first batch. I'm learning.

###Marriage

STBX was pissed back in February because I sent our tax refund to my personal account, then transferred her half when it came in. ""It should have gone to our joint account"" - and now with the stimulus it automatically went to my account again  so she was upset again. So I told her ""You threatened to take money that doesn't belong to you when you overreacted to me putting the savings back in savings at the end of last year. I've shared everything we've received 50/50. Maybe don't make threats next time, and I won't feel the need to protect myself."" She tried to twist the facts, but I stood my ground, so she texted my mom a screengrab of our conversation . My mom told me she had and said I should be nicer... I told her to mind her own business. 

Nothing else significant... finally found a place still doing Notary work and made an appointment this next week to get the uncontested document Notarized, STBX will be there to sign. 

###Goals

Apparently my gym (24 Hour Fitness) will be declaring bankruptcy.

**Reading** Models, TRM:PM

Began working on the demographics exercise from Models - what am I? Who is in my sphere, my ""demographic"" and thus who might be attracted to me? Business women who travel 100%? That would be the woman who picked me up last year. Its still academic as NYC is talking about a July or August opening. As I worked on it a question occurred to me: Is wife in the demographic that would be attracted to me? Spoiler: no.

**Mindset**

Maybe it was due to being stuck with no female interaction other then wife, but I need to own the fail day I had last week that was off/on for almost the entire day: While reading thru a disassembly of some hapless n00b in the comments in askMRP I realized I've still got a lot of work still to do myself. PON helped me realize how tied up my ego is in ""being the victim"". And I've been working on the exercises for that. But I'm like Alex j Anderson's passive aggressive evil twin. I'm the unicorn that should not have been cheated on. I'm the only one ever to deal with an alpha widow, etc, etc. Each time I started down this mental spiral I was able to stop - for a time, but then it would sneak back in. The siren call of the self-pitying mope. On the positive side, I have the tools to deal with this, I kept all this to myself (at least I think I did), and I appear to have a ""floor"" that I can climb back up from. 

**Relationship**

It was pointed out to me in last week's comments that she's probably faking it: She's most likely still not attracted to me - she's doing it out of obligation, or to keep me from being Billy Beta Butthurt, etc. Was I trying to ""prove"" something? Be better than him? Am I keeping ""score""? I was for a while, but now I focus on what I feel like. I keep the pedal down on polarity and let it play out however it will.

Overall I find myself laughing at the pathetic loser I used to be, and probably still am. The day after that fail day I actually laughed out loud thinking back to it. What a waste of time that was.  I think that may be my mission: to just enjoy myself. Stop taking myself, or what she thinks, with any seriousness whatsoever. Instead just laugh. Too much other shit going on to get hung up on this ""relationship"" crap.",0

**Read and thoughts:**

Steel's Guide to Married Red Pill (and down the rabbit hole on all links), need to reread.  

WISNIFG  Learnt a better way of communicating, I am not anymore the conversation finisher. Letting the hamster DEER is better than confronting it.

MMSLP  Got horny just by imagining doing all the things there. Shit, I need to lift now.

The rational male Year One  Oneitis, plates, game, hypergamy, frame so much wisdom there.  

NMMNG - I understood I have been a nice guy for life. I learned to listen and to be more assertive during conversations. Listen more.

The Game - it was an insightful book. I was expecting a guy bragging on how easy he picks up girls. I read an inner trip with lots of useful reflections.

Steel's Guide to Married Red Pill  It will be a long journey for a career beta like me.

MRP Beginner's Guide for the Career Beta  I want to read again in a few months and be proud of how far I have gone.

Currently reading: not really reading, just latest posts in MRP and askMRP, I have too much things to do to catch up with my goals  

Reading queue:

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius  I kind of like stoicism. Getting worried about mundane things is like when a small baby have a tantrum over a random toy.

The Mindful Attraction Plan (stalled)

Book of pook (stalled)

Audiobooks:

TWOTSM  I followed HornsOfApathys advice and I am listening to audiobooks while training. Book is inspiring, too deep/god focused, maybe I am still not ready, but I am enjoying the explanations.

**Myself:**

Confinement. Routine. Wake up. Kids tasks. Cook. Work tasks. Food. Train or not. Projects or laziness in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Hey, I built a wall. No, not an emotional wall you feelings-porn-seeker, a real one with bricks and mortar. For being a first time I feel really proud. I build things. I am a man now.

For the DoD challenge, I keep working out, diet is not soo bad and of course I shower and shave every day you disgusting faggots! Keeping house a bit better, but I need to do some tasks none of my children (including wife) feel responsible for. They will. Because I will guide them.

I have been busy with myself. Changes and habits take some time to settle, so I did not feel like writing weekly. It might sound like an excuse, but I did not want to repeat myself. Still, from time to time is good to write down to keep the pulse (and get some kick in the ass from wiser men).  

I own that I need to improve with the kids. I could be better and schedule better and be stricter and plan better and guide better but they are kids and are trapped here, so I let them slip a bit from schedule and be kids. Still, there is room to improvement and I will go for it. A bit stricter in the mornings and more playful in the afternoons, that will be me.

Time is scarce due to the fact that I am supposed to be working and dealing with kiddos at the same time, and this is not possible. So I work afternoons after wife comes back from the job.

I am still searching for my mission. By listening TWOTSM I had to stop lifting for a few minutes and list all the shit I like to do, I want to do, and there are a lot of things, but no real legacy yet. Nothing tells me go for it, they are still a bunch of long-term things I want to do. I will choose some things and see if it brings me to a better sense of mission.  

**Current goals:**

* Reach 1000 lbs club: deadlifting heavy is the best feeling I have in life. I cannot explain it but if I had to do a personal record or fuck, I would go for deadlifting (iron oneitis?). Max 1RM theoretic calculations put me in 800. I will try when it says 1100.
* Play guitar. And sing. I will be a rock star. Yeah I also dont believe it, but it is fucking fun.
* Be consistent with my working, training, household, etc. I need to put it as a goal because being the best me is part of my mission.

**Relationship:**

I am surprised on how unemotional I have become regarding my relationship most of the time. No, really, not angry anymore, no fear or whatever. I was over-sensitized lately and jumping at every bone. I somehow dont care about many things that would have had me angry and emotional regarding the relationship. I kind of see shit tests and am sorry, what?, you expect me to react to that?. Old me would DEER and whine and justify and make things rational and explain and prove and try and on and on but new(TM?) me is kind of whatever IDNGAF. And the best is that I mean it. My relationship is still really important to me, but the explosions/situations of the moment are not interesting me at all.  

Too much shit to do to be bothered I guess I am now at 80% of the time with this attitude, 20% resentment. This 80% is not rambo, it includes  initiating, relaxed attitude dude this confinement has been a blessing in disguise for me. The 20% are still my insecurities and fears and still being angry for not getting the treatment I deserve and fuck the noise, I just STFU and it disappears after some time. I am kind of relieved I am not in the emotional roller-coaster anymore.  

We are still not talking about us, but I am not sure I want to taaaaalk anymore. We share time together, play with the children, have some interesting non-relationship conversations, watch some serial together, pair of sexy times a week (I want more, and I dont get butthurt when rejected most of the time)... a standard blueish relationship. If she is fucking around or hiding things/lying is her fucking problem, fuck her (I still have oneitis, so I am trying to fake it until I make it). Not where I want to be, but far better than before. I take my time for myself and she is not the center of the universe, the center of the universe is again that marvelous land called Fraggle Rock or me, better me.  

**Lifting:**

\#60DoD  Weights are improving. I was lying to myself in the first OYS about my weights, this is where I though I was. Well, I was not close, I injured myself because I was too proud to lower the weights and do proper form, recovered and now my lifts are where I really am, proper form and at a minimum x5. I am fine with that and getting in a good shape.  

Doing Phraks Greyskull LP Variant and adding some shoulder and back exercises alternating days, plus some abs.  

Still a bit of fat, but I look better in pictures than two months ago. I had not decided in my last OYS if reducing body fat or going for increasing strength. I will go for the strength, I felt miserable when I tried to cut calories. And the mirror shows me a better body now, so even at the same BF% there is a huge difference.

**Diet & habits:**

I feel better and more energetic when I eat in a surplus. I will not go go-mad, but will keep calories high for now.  

I stopped cigarettes completely. They are disgusting now. Weed is reduced to evenings with wife, but I am also cutting that from last night (not even a goodbye joint, I stopped already). I dont drink, so I will go back to weed for recreational purposes, but I need at least a full clean month before considering that for now.  

I have enough rest, but I am not sleeping my 8 hours. I need to schedule myself better now that I am really doing things.  

**Financial:**

We share expenses. No change here. I started to do projects with the computer. Nothing that can create money yet, but the skills I need to build them will put me on the right track.

**Social:**

With the virus outbreak I am isolated at home with the kids. That is making social interaction scarce. Some video calls at work and with groups of friends, but they are not the real thing.",0

**Mission:**

* Win each day.

Be a man I respect. A man of strength, courage and wisdom.

**Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.*

* Have used slightly higher does of sleeping tablets this week when stress was high.
* Run to burn off energy/stress.
* Weights three times.
* Seem to be putting on some muscle, not sure if its t-cream or increased calories.
* Had to take a break from all strengthening exercises for knee, ongoing pain since I pushed too hard which is disappointing as I thought it was getting better. Ill give it a few more days off then reset.

**Separation:**

* Ex reacted as I predicted to a letter from my lawyer. Im in a difficult position, she has just stopped allowing overnights for bullshit reasons. If I push it I wont see my daughter at all until I get an urgent court application (assuming I do at this time). If I dont push it she feels like she has won and will be encouraged to do this in the future. I have talked to lawyers (two to triangulate what Im being told)  Im finding the whole thing extremely frustrating. I dropped daughter off the other day and ex brought it all up in front of her. I said dont talk about it in front of daughter and she kept going at me while I got in car and drove off.
* So what am I doing  firstly I stopped. I was getting caught up in ego, then I considered a proper time perspective, in 2 years this will all be locked down legally and Ill have most of what I want. So, while it is frustrating and I want to do something the right play is to wait it out (mediation) then have an urgent application ready to go. I will not stop the money during this time although I legally could, it would look like Im retaliating. Previously I had in my mission (and it came back this week because I felt like writing it) Be a man I respect that man would see the frustration and let it pass over him, he would not react to petty ego games to get a short term ego win at the expense of what he really wants in the medium term. He would not forget to think about 2 years from now because something is happening 2 minutes from now. So that is what Im doing, its frustrating but I am going to do what needs to be done to get the best long term outcome.

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

* I feel better than I have in as long as I can remember. Ex is being annoying but I am in a strong position because I have done the work to get myself here. Life is only going to get better because Im going to keep doing the work to make it better. Im doing things that I want to do and am starting to craft a vision rather than just letting life happen to me.
* Still struggling with the tension of doing what I want and feeling good in the moment and doing what I should do which would progress me towards my goals but does not feel good and goes against some internal resistance.
* Following [u/Tyred\_Biggums](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyred_Biggums/) comment last week I have been thinking about Shame/needy partners and selfishness. Im not sure what I want to do for me, I did the NMMNG activity on this and have a few items. Most of these dont raise any issues e.g. I want to do a rally driving course and probably will. But there are a few that get to other issues. One is own a nice car, buying myself a nice car seems selfish because you could spend that money on the greater good. Im not sure 100% where this comes from but my parents have a part. I imagine my dad being disappointed in my decision. Im clearly still not living in my own frame if Im worried about things like that in the first place. Also, looking at shame and picking needy women I think they are two separate issues that feed into each other. I pick needy women because it makes me feel safe, they need me and so I dont have to worry. I feel shame because I feel like having any needs is wrong and will result in love being taken away, I am defective just by having needs. This feels so typical nice guy that I kept looking for something else but that is what it is. I try to have no needs, I dont inconvenience, I am always trying to do the right thing, when you combine that with picking a needy women and a fear of being alone you get my relationships and my codependency issues.
* Im not sure why I am so worried about being lonely/alone. Sometimes I find MRP very nihilistic and feel empty, Im still not sure what to replace that with. I go camping on my own quite a bit and feel happy and fine when Im doing that but with others I still chase something from that connection that I cant ever get. I need to spend more time thinking about this. Or maybe I dont, maybe I just want to have a nice car a fuck a pair of 19 year olds Im not sure yet.

**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*

* Im concerned my ex is coaching our daughter to say she doesnt want to stay at my house. There have been a few things she has said that leads me to believe this.
* Im worried about exs mental state and the effect that is having on our daughter e.g. her picking up on the anxiety. She has had some tantrums lately, I just try and be there not making a big deal about it all and making sure she knows I love her.
* My plan is to be a stable and safe place where she is always welcome and loved. Im listening to more Janet Lansbury podcasts while I wait for the book to arrive. This is giving me a lot of material to work with.

**Shit to Own:**

* Used porn again to feel better  not sure if I should focus on cutting this now. Its not a huge problem and Im focusing on other things. Long term I will need to at least run periods without it.
* Still think about the relationship sometimes and indulge myself here. Second guessing my decision, thinking how maybe I could make it work etc.
* Scared of being alone.
* Not sure where to go next with my development. I have had that feeling a lot and will just keep pushing and see where I end up.",1
3814,3815,"**NMMNG**

**Breaking Free Activity 7:** can people see my imperfections and still love me? How would I be different if I knew the people I care about would never leave/stop loving me? 

* On an intellectual level yes but it doesnt feel that way. What else is there to love other than how I give to them and if I have imperfections then I am giving less. The bit about people being attracted to another persons life energy resonated with me, I used to have that but I seem to have lost it to a large degree. The work Im doing here is bringing it back. 
* I would say what I thought, I would express myself authentically, I would not consider how they would react before speaking. I wouldnt pass everything through the will it piss them off filter, I would not try and prove how useful I am, I would just act in line with my authentic self rather than towards getting a specific action from them. 

**Breaking Free Activity 8:** Validating behavior to stop/increase. 

* Im not in a relationship so that eliminated a lot of my normal validation seeking behavior. I picked seeking validation from women on apps as this is something I was working on anyway. I am cutting that out. 
* When I was doing it more, I felt distracted and like I was always chasing something. I was living outside myself and I felt pulled in all different directions. This was because I was responding to something external without any internal sense of direction. My whole being was reacting to the whims of how some random women reacted towards me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 9:** Something I wanted to do for myself. 

Struggled with this one, I have a lot of hang-ups about what I want to do. Being selfish seems a terrible thing to be. There are a bunch of sex things but Im worried that is validation at this point, do I want to fuck a 19 year old for validation or because I just want to? Probably both. 

* Get a nice car
* Get tailored suite + shirts 
* Fuck a 19 year old
* Rally driving course 
* Beach resort holiday 
* Allow myself to be what I am
* Camping on beach for a month 

Need to revisit this activity at some point, this list is pretty lame. 

**Breaking Free Activity 10:** affirmations.

The ones that work for me are listed below. I say these before bed during my 10min med. 

* I am lovable just as I am
* My needs matter
* I do not break
* I am my own judge  
* I am consistently improving myself and my life
* I am deeply connected to all things in life
* I let fear pass through me
* I focus and apply myself towards my goals 
* I like and respect myself 

**Breaking Free Activity 11: Go on a retreat alone.** 

During lockdown this is not viable. Having said that, I regularly spend time alone, camping alone etc and this is some of the most stress free and enjoyable time for me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 12**: Do you believe its ok to have needs? Do you belief people want to help you meet your needs? Do you believe this world is a place of abundance? 

* No to all three questions. 
* I remember hiding myself away as a kid and feeling embarrassed of needing anything emotionally. At the same time, I dont want to become more needy. Im not sure how to balance these two, I need to understand how to be self-reliant and not needy but at the same time recognize and act on my needs. 
* Re people meeting your needs, Im not sure what I think, really at the end of the day it is an exchange of value. If they get what they want from you they will give in return. 
* I think fear is at the root of my scarcity. I close up to the world to protect myself and so the world is closed to me. When I was a kid, there was money scarcity, I was given messages that having nice things (like a nice car) was selfish, when I was a teen/early 20s there was women scarcity (and money scarcity!) and now I have a general scarcity attitude. I am starting to open up from this, seeing there are plenty of women, friends and opportunities in life. Im still not there on the money.",0

Especially since you already state that you don't want to go anywhere near that philosophy - of course the natural way to do that is to ignore it/not socialise with people who hold those beliefs.

The rest half feel they don't 'need' a counselor. Literally. Every. Single. Woman. I know intimately is riddled with mental health issues.

Game theory aside, you'll find that one of the most recommended advises on the seduction community is to work on yourself instead of chasing women. Hell, learning about seduction and game is in itself self improvment. 

From my experience. I have reached states where I was very, very mature. I was neither angry nor impatient nor insecure nor needy. I was confident, calm, smooth, rational, fun but not forcibely, everything was so genuine about me, and I felt totally in synch with myself.  

What I noticed about those moments, aside from the inner peace I had. Is that people just followed me. If I was with a girl then seducing her was not necessary, Hell I didn't have to talk or say anything, I could sit there with a girl totally silent and somehow I could feel that she's enjoying my company. Same with guys. And when I said let's go there or do that and I lead, they just followed, no questions asked, no ""Why!! we can't, it's better to do that and that"" It was a great feeling. But I am unable to stay in that state for very long.   


This made me wonder, if I improve myself to the point where I'm in that state most of them time, what would I need girls for apart from sex? I mean everybody will talk about not being needy when you want a girl, but if you're not needy and abundant, why would you need her?

I don't like the style and it was purchased for and came from the home he shared with his ex. Now, he wants to purchase two cellular shades to cover two windows in the living room. The shades cost $400 just for two! (we thought it would cost half as much) The dining tables I'm interested in costs $450-$500. When we realized the price I messaged him that its really expensive and asked if we could get a different type of cellular shades or use curtains for now. I also said I'd rather spend that amount of money on a dining table. He responded with that he would appreciate the blinds more and that we can go buy them today. 

He makes way more money than I do. I work reduced hours because of the virus but my hours have fluctuated between full and part time.

> I really feel dismissed and I feel like he's prioritizing his desires over mine.

First, it's irrelevant who makes more money, if you're not keeping your income separate. I make 20k more than my husband and I don't get to use that in arguments.

Second, it feels like he's prioritizing his wants over yours, because it's true. He wants what he wants, not what you want and it's as simple as that. I highly doubt he sees this as a sign of disregard or dismissal. He just wants some blinds and you already have a table. 

If you want to make progress on this issue, particularly if it's recurring and not just this one thing, you need to *calmly* explain how this makes you feel. This was his ex's table and you don't like it and have been wanting to replace it for years, to his refusal, and now you especially don't want to take it to a new house. You clearly have the expendable income and you've wanted to replace the table for longer than he's wanted blinds. You'd really like to get the table and make blinds the next big purchase. Perhaps you can sell the current table and put that money toward it. I also think it's worth mentioning that his response came off as really dismissive. 

The key here is to politely refuse to go pick up the blinds before talking about it, so you don't just end up with new blinds. Then calmly tell him how you feel without assuming he intended any of it. Then work together to reach a compromise. If you can't get the table now, because there's some reason the blinds must come first, then when can you? Can you start setting money aside with his blessing?",0

Why not buy it yourself in this case and end the discussion? In the US any part-time job pays you more than 500$ or do you assume he has to pay for the furniture?

3856,3857,"Musings on a MSM's journey towards masculinity.Me: 26 years old, teacher, living in a big but not huge city.

I am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity.

I was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth.

I had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago.

Beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men.

I began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily.

Of course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted.

A turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time.

I came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned:

\- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness.

\- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity.

\- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with.

\- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles.

\- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood.

\- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood.

\- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women.

\- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc.

\- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities.

\- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc.

\- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice.

\- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play.

\- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina.

\- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again. There is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man (or vice versa), buy a house together and pretend to be man, wife, and kids et al., nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we 'love' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us.

\- Masculinity isn't necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys, making lots of money, and being muscular, though for many it is, and will be. Masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible.",0
3857,3858,"can I ask, do you live alone? as a young gay guy who still lives with family, and who has 0 aspirations in life, I find it really hard to give myself the drive to make anything of myself, as I'm not motivated by wealth or status. for years, I kind of aspired to one day have an ltr without kids due to my extreme loneliness, but I have difficulty in seeing the point in that as well now. the only thing that even slightly motivates me now is moving out one day so I can have the sex life I've always wanted, but that isn't really gratifying long term.

If you ask sociologists, it's about being more likely to be accused and sentenced for crimes.

If you ask evolutionary psychologists, it's about status and access to women, in other words men committing crimes for the benefit of women or for their positive attention.

Regardless, even normalized for the same crimes, out of the accused, men are disproportionally more often sentenced than women and out of the sentenced ones, they're getting harsher sentences than women. Men are also less likely to get any help and are discriminated against by the police when they're victims of crimes.

Knowing this and the existence of this proof even having seen it themselves in some cases, I still see the same women becoming his friends and hanging out with him as if it's totally normal. 
He never apologized he denied the whole incident and then went ahead to spread rumours about me being a ""characterless"" woman, who was drunk and delusional.

Not just this, the popular girls here the ones that are considered nice and you know not problematic or feminist like me, are usually the ones who allow casual sexism, laugh at sexist jokes, and basically appease men. I have tried hanging out in these groups or been forced on several occasions, and I've been put off by the huge amount of shit that these girls are putting up with. And when I bring it up they make excuses and they say it's how boys are.

Other actresses who *definitely* were aware of his behavior continued to work with him because if they also spoke out about it theyd be blacklisted as well. A smaller version happens within social circles.

Something about sympathy because maslows hierarchy of needs aren't being met and a section of men are going to start offing themselves. 

But there's a reason these guys aren't getting a girlfriend. It's a free market hence very competitive. You are both the product and the sales man. These guys either have shitty products, are shit sales men or both.  Basically no woman wants to buy what they're selling. And some set their price too high (they only want hot chicks). 

And these failed sales men are very sad. They can't get girlfriends/wives. They'll stop working because they'll never have a family. Something something taxes. Then they'll shoot up a couple schools . Did I get that right? 

Once upon a time it wasn't a free market. Markets were very regulated and women couldn't choose who they wanted to marry. Being young wild and free was shamed. And pre-birthcontrol that lifestyle would have been much harder. 

Women married men they didn't feel anything for. They had sex with and raised kids for these men. They lived quite lives of servitude and were more or less miserable. Not all women . Just the women who had to marry the bottom tier men. 

After the sexual revolution women no longer had to date and marry bottom tier men. Online dating was the  dating markets version of globalization hence ""Chad( The Chinese)  is stealing our women( manufacturing jobs)"". So anyway these men stopped getting sex and we're back to current 2020. 

It seems there's no middle ground. Either the bottom tier men get wives and are happy and productive  while their wives are miserable.  Or the women date who they want and are free to be single while bottom tier men suffer from loneliness. 

Personally I wouldn't want my daughter being forced to date someone so he won't commit suicide or shoot up a school.

3891,3892,"Western Society was built because of the culture of monogamy where the bottom 80% of men made major contributions. These contributions were made in exchange for access to reproduction they wouldnt normally have access to (due to socially enforced monogamy, religion, patriarchy) 

If majority of men truly become incel, society will crumble and devolve back to the days when the 80/20 rule was even more apparent 8000 years ago when [17 women reproduced for every 1 man](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success)

Women's mating strategies/preferences are not selected for advanced societies. They select for muscles,  broad shoulders, height, jawline - traits that were advantageous in ancient times rife with tribal warfare. They don't select for IQ which is necessary for advanced western civilizations

The feminist pipe dream is to revert to our primal mating strategies (for women) while retaining all the benefits provided by the unworthy masses of men giving rise to modern civilization. Good luck to them all.

A modern western society cannot exist when hypergamy is fully realized like 8000 years ago. Yes, muh lady will be more free but society will devolve",1

3897,3898,"Parents who didn't want to have kids - are you happy now?Hi! I have a problem and I need a straightforward advice. I have a question for all the parents who didn't want to have kids and now have them - has life changed for better or for worse? Is it worth having kids? And for all the parents who always wanted to have kids and now regret having them.

WHY do you regret it or WHY are you happy? Be honest, please. 

Me (f28) and my partner (m29) have been together for almost 10 years. Recently we've been having more and more fights about having kids - he doesn't want them and I do. I know you think it's stupid to discuss kids after 10 years of being together. A quick backstory is that when we were dating for about two years, he said to me that he wanted to have a baby with me someday. Over the years he was becoming more and more red pill, saw the negative sides of having kids and told me a few years ago that he doesn't want to have kids (and I get that, there are a lot of bad sides of parenting). The problem is that we love each other so much. We are soulmates. But we know whether we have or we don't have kids, one of us will probably be unhappy. But if I leave him, I know I'll be miserable becuse I love him so much. I also think there is a LOW chance that I meet some other guy who I will love as much as my partner now and who will want to have kids. Me and my partner really get along. I know if I end up leaving him I'll just be miserable.

So I am obviously wondering if we ever end up having kids afterall, how much chance there is for him to be happy. (I'm not intending to get pregnant ""by accident"" because that means I'll be intentionally ruining his life.)

So ... what's your story? Thanks!",0
3898,3899,couldnt stand kids and never wanted them. Sons turning 4 now and I have zero regrets. Its one of the few times ive been happy making sure someone else is happy. Its weird. Its very expensive and rewarding and will scare the shit out of you. AND only do it if the relationship is VERY stable,0
3899,3900,"Hmm it sounds weird yes haha and a bit hard to understand, but thanks a lot for your reply! Can I ask you something ... when you said you're happy making them happy - were you like that before or totally opposite? Because my partner really really likes his alone time, the sense of freedom etc., and I can't help but think that making someone else happy would just drain him (he's an introvert).",0
3900,3901,"It's funny, because he sounds very similar to me around that age.  Coincidentally it's also the same age we did make the decision to have a kid.  Personally, I regret absolutely nothing.  It's amazing the emotional roller coaster that you go through once you do have kids to take care of.  I never imagined it possible to love anyone as much as I love these 2 little guys.  As a man there is a much deeper sense of meaning in your life that is discovered once you're a father and you would literally die for your kids without even thinking for a second.  The responsibility to take care of them and provide for them makes life so much more meaningful and fulfilling and that in itself provides a deep sense of purpose and happiness that I didn't know was possible.   This doesn't exist in a life where your only purpose is immediate gratification and pleasure seeking.  That will get old very quick and the inevitable existential crisis will be just around the corner.  Jordan Peterson's work has really shone a light on that for me.",0
3901,3902,"That is interesting. Thanks! And thanks of reminding me of Peterson, that's a good point. So what made you change your mind and decide to have a kid?",0
3902,3903,"Wife had a meltdown after our first kid that lasted for 3 years so it's not your usual post partum depression. Straight up abusive and aggressive. I swore I'd never have any more kids with her and she agreed. 

Fast forward few years later she remembers her dream family had 3 kids. She had this vision since she was 9, and wanted it realised here and now. So after a year of bitching I caved. 

And here we go again, same old shit hit the fan and she started having her fits again. But this time I was slightly red pilled so my response wasn't as hectic as before so it stopped.

Do I regret it? Fuck no. I love that little fat porky more than anything in my life now.",0
3903,3904,"Sorry to hear that, it sounds tough. But I'm happy for you! I'm actually surprised how many people say it's tough and scarry having kids but really worth it. Like fulfilling. I still don't get it how it can be both but I believe it. Thanks for your story!",0

Also I read somewhere that (I don't know if it's a correct number, but it is very high) about 40% of parents wish they made a different decision and never had kids (if they could choose again), although they love their kids and they mean the world to them.

3907,3908,"Books that make you a more attractive person, instead of emotional manipulation and ""game theory""?I've been browsing redpill occasionally, but I don't really subscribe to the theory, what with game theory and the emotional manipulation and whatnot. However, I can't deny that I have not been very successful with women. I think I'm generally rather bad at reading signs, and escalating. I'm not looking for one-night shit anyway, just want to be a bit better at the aforementioned when I meet a girl I might actually be interested in. Can you recommend me some books which can help in that regard, with becoming a more attractive person in general, and a better relationship partner, without the messed up redpill aspects?",0

3914,3915,"No book is perfect. There's a couple of things that Mark Manson says that also doesn't resonate with me. I think a more balanced outlook on it is. If you want to get girls, don't manipulate yourself and women to achieve it. Be the person you want to be and you'll naturally become more attractive.",0
3915,3916,What do you think makes an attractive person? I dont mean what do you think women think is attractive but what do you specifically think.,0
3916,3917,"Self-confident, no self-destructive habits, easy in conversation, intelligent, physically attractive (obviously), doesn't require attention, to name a couple.

For example, I'd like to not care about whether or not one person gives me attention or not, but I've noticed that if I for example have a crush on a girl, I care a lot and I'll be looking at my phone extremely often to see if they've responded yet. Just typing it out makes me cringe. I hate it and I want to change that.",0
3917,3918,"Not sure I'm part of the redpill (advice)I'm a male in my  very early 20s. I've only been in 1 relationship before (intentionally). I dont believe in sleeping around with random women going clubbing and things like that. I'm a reserved man. 

After my 1st relationship ended a while ago I've been looking into the redpill ideology. A lot of it did make sense to me , and I saw some aspects of mistakes I made in my 1st relationship which made me lean to it. However I've been through reddit and I've seen some women and a some men totally against TRP. I have a date after this lockdown ends.. and I aim in implementing some of the redpill techniques (not all) . What advice do you guys have? Whether man or woman",0
3918,3919,"Quit redpill.

3921,3922,"Same, red will place and convince you of one view and one view only, toxicity and bitterness",0
3922,3923,"Speaking as old geezer, the red pill was different before incels raided it with their negative attitude and turned it to hate fueled mindset. 
  
  
in general principles, trp message was: be
the attractive and assertive man that is desired by men and women as well.  
  
  
  strive to be fit, keep the skin clean, dress good (lot of subreddits about it), work on your friend circle, have a hobby that you are passionate about.  dont be afraid to stand for yourself, but know when to keep your mouth shut. 
 

people take the advice literally with this ""negging"" or holding picture frames (LOL). they go clubbing with mysoginistic attitude and then complain that they did not get laid, lol. 
    
 trp was much different back then than this crap.",0
3923,3924,"I've ""learnt"" them in the sense that I believe some of the concepts they teach, ie:

\- Women are hypergamous, they place priority on finance and status and stability. But hypergamy isn't the only thing that women care about. Likewise how men don't always care about looks alone. It's complex.

\- Alpha F\*\*\* and Beta bucks concept makes sense but **to me it applies to both genders**. I'd also be okay with a really great looking woman who's loyal and supportive and all that, yet fun in bed? ""Alpha males"" just seem to give off the vibe that they would be good in bed anyways so perhaps some women who are feeling it at that point of time would be more inclined for casual sex, in this case when they are ovulating which does seem to be the case even with girls I've talked to about ovulation (good friends so we talk about weird stuff all the time..)

\- Spinning plates theory. The number of plates they ask you to have seems abit unnecessary. Nonetheless, having options seems like a good idea.

All in all, i just took away the fact that I need to have more self-respect, self-improvement and I need to be more strategic in the sense that I don't subconsciously put a girl on the pedestal just because she ticks some boxes. I just feel that I have to mature and not be too easily charmed by a girl.

&#x200B;

What do you think? Is it good to have this mentality? If otherwise do share. I'd hope for relationships to be simplistic but it doesn't seem to be the case. Divorce rates have skyrocketed and a lot of unhappy relationships happen, I do not want to be next.  


I don't know whether I should continue red-pilling. I just get real depressed about it.",0
3924,3925,"I think basic ideas like looking nice, maybe by working out a bit to attract more women and the psychological stuff to make women more attracted to you work, but I would advise against doing a lot of the psychological manipulation because it is well... manipulation. And it can get to a mentally abusive point with Red Pill ideology. 

But stuff that's not harmful like working out, looking nice, coming off confident, and tips to help make a connection with a woman or get her to notice you aren't too bad. Stuff like dreading a woman is pretty messed up though. So the basic tips that are perfectly healthy and just increase your chances aren't too bad but when it gets to manipulation which it will, steer clear of that stuff. 

The ideology, techniques and language Red Pillers believe in and use is designed to warp the perception of men new to the sub of how things really are and get you to doubt yourself and women, see flaws in yourself/dating/women even in normal interactions where there aren't any, and take self doubt and disenfranchisement with dating women and grow and use that to indoctrinate you with their beliefs and turn that into hatred of women. It gets pretty toxic ngl.

Just look at some of the ex Red Pill stories about Red Pill ruined a lot of guys relationships, not just romantic but nuked relationships between even years long friends and family, and at the time the guys thought they were doing better because they were drowning in
pussy, and every time they were sad because things in their life were fucked up, they leaned more into Red Pill instead of realising that it's normal to be sad when you've burnt down bridges with years long friends and your own family and lots of pussy is not going to solve that.",0
3925,3926,Wow.  I never really thought of it that way. Ur right about taking the good from it like working out and so on. But staying away from the manipulation tactics,0
3926,3927,"I wanted to post a thread, because I just looked into redpill recently, as a 19 year old guy, I just want to minimize my potential mistakes as much as I can. And I stand with you that some of the ideas make sense.

But again, I just started to look into it for a week. I'm hoping to make peace with the whole situation, because redpilling looks like a very shitty route to take.  


(FYI, I couldn't post the thread, and I'm not sure why because I tried to follow the guidelines, it might just be my karma count because I'm relatively new to reddit as a whole)",0

(He also hates the guy asking him, as he's generally a dick, and Daniels has also talked to prez informally and can see the guy isn't smart with his words, and needs a lawyer)

However no matter how much I will try to convince these people in a debate they will look at me as uneducated and loony almost. For example I got one guy who just kept repeating ""check out Edward Horgon's from Harvard university why women perfer bad boys"" which he didn't link and I didn't get search results.

Because when people are sure about something that make them feel better about themselves (example with them : ""that's not my fault, it's women's because they are like that!!!""), no matter how hard you try to show them the truth, they will deny it.

On OkCupid, users take more time looking through users' descriptions along with their profile picture. So OkCupid did an experiment where people rated other users' photos and their personalities based on their description of themselves. Here is the link to that:  [https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/weexperimentonhumanbeings.html](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/weexperimentonhumanbeings.html)  .",0

This isn't an actual measure of what your **actual** personality is. 

It's what people guess based on your looks.

If you look good, people are more likely to vote more positively on your personality aswell. Because your brain attaches good looks to something positive. So it naturally makes a false assumption.

Masculism should be about addressing issues that are especially faced by men, and solving them in such a way that everyone can benefit.

Just as an example, there's the example that men are more likely to have physically demanding jobs and to be injured while doing so. If injured working men are being undersupported by society, it's possible that that's rooted in a belief that working men are disposable, and that's something we should challenge not to make people feel ashamed of implicit biases they have, but to solve problems for working men.",0

---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.

**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.

*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.

**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

>TL;DR A girl I've known for a while, with some common friends. How to contact her and chat a bit, making your intentions of going out after the lockdown clear but without sounding like a sex predator or something?

I think this is something others are experiencing in this period too

So, there is this girl I kinda like, but we have a basic ""hello, how you doin'"" relationship since a while and haven't seen each other in months

Now, I'm thinking hell why not contact her, write a bit and polarize the thing, so when the lockdown is over we can go grab a coffee and you know.

I can see 2 problems:

\* I don't want to come off as creepy, contacting her now after months and we never talked much anyway. I really want a genuine connection

BUT

\* I don't want to come off as an uninterested friend neither. I mean, while I genuinely enjoy human contact and knowing people, regardless of everything, it should be clear that I am also looking for a more intimate thing, polarize it, that is.

I would just invite her for a coffee... if things were normal. But now?

Basic question you may ask me: why now after months?

Well, I'm a bit insecure and now I'm working on that part of myself, and also yes, I'm bored. And she is cute, and smart.

Just send her a flirty non-needy statement that makes her know that you were thinking of her. Back and forth for a bit, then suggest going out after the lockdown lifts.

4064,4065,"I Have Been Doing Cold Approach For 2 Years Now: This Is How I Went From Kissless Handholdless Virgin To 15 Lays In 1 Month&#x200B;

About 3 years ago, I was a 29 year old Asian guy with only a couple months to go before I turned 30, working at a Big 3 Accounting Firm, and I was realizing that I was unhappy and miserable, working long hours at all times of the day and night and spending all my free time playing Overwatch, and Dota 2

And despite earning good money, I had a house and some savings, I just knew my life was NOWHERE near where I wanted it to be or thought it SHOULD be, despite all the years of hard work because I was FOREVER ALONE. I was still a virgin at age 29. A kissless handholdless virgin I just wanted to take the time to finally get this off my chest since I have nothing better to do during the quarantine.

I soon decided, with the help of an epiphany while reading an article on RedPill titled HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD that this was not the life for me and that I would need to start approaching girls and learning game to have any hope of losing my virginity before 30

I didn't want to become a 100+ lay gigachad like the article outlined:

* I just wanted to experience what other guys experienced in college that I missed out on.
* I just wanted to have someone I could share my hopes and struggles with, someone I could come home to and hug if I had a bad day.
* I just wanted to have some fun before I get married and start a family

Was that really too much to ask?

So I quickly began to learn about game and seduction and browsed Reddit and other forums almost daily to get hyped up and learn how to do cold approach. I soon discovered, however, that I had bitten off far more than I could chew

I met up with a white guy I met online who seemed equally as motivated as me to go out and approach and we went out to several bars and clubs together. Every time we went out, he would always go home with a new girl, mostly Asian girls Im not proud of it, but I was extremely jealous since none of these girls gave me any kind of IOIs or other signs of attraction when I approached, and stopped going out with him. Now, I realize it's because he went to the gym a lot and always had a nice haircut, but back then, It was kind of ridiculous how Id approach girl after girl and get one word answers and a GO AWAY vibe the entire conversation and he would come in a few minutes later and THE SAME GIRL would be smiling and asking him questions about himself, it felt like he didnt even need to do any work to get laid

At this point, I was watching pickup videos from or reading articles on how to get girls on an almost daily basis, trying to study and learn all the latest game techniques. It felt like I hit a brick wall. This was SOOO much harder than I thought it would be. The HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article specifically said that women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one but that didnt seem to be the case. I was a 55 Asian guy competing with 60+ white guys at every club I went to and it felt like no matter what I said, no girls were even willing to have an actual conversation with me. This is after 100+ approaches so I knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort.

So reluctantly, after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality, I invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since I figured I was already watching so many of their videos, and its only fair that I pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing.

For those of you thinking about going to a PUA Bootcamp, be very careful you don't waste all your money like I did. This particular company did not give a single FUCK about me other than my money. My instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach, which I already knew how to do, and every time I asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive, he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off. I asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers, always giving some woo woo answer about how I needed to have outcome independence and have more fun. It was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance, even though they teach that looks don't matter.

I finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches. It was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and I just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts. At this point, I was so desperate that I tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date Over the next couple of years, I became obsessed with getting good with girls, which certainly kept me going, but it also caused some problems

I went out with so many wingmen, hoping to find that gold nugget, that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall, but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5'10"", no exceptions. I read an article on Reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot. Girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when I asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together. That's when it hit me that I didn't know as much as I thought I did and that there was a lot more to learn.

The bad news is, all this rejection was not good for my mental health. I started to wonder if maybe a short Asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate I was seriously considering moving to Thailand or The Philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife

But finally, I found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and I immersed myself in his training He was 57 and Asian, so a short Asian like me.

The first thing he told me was that my hairstyle, fashion, and body language were all shit and unless I fix them first, nothing else would work. Now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice I read like the HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article which convinced me that looks dont matter but I decided to give it a shot. I got a blazer and chinos from Zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch. I didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable IMMEDIATELY. Suddenly, they would hang in and listen to every word I had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave. One girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when I asked her to grab a drink with me! I was SOOO HAPPY, it felt like everything changed.

Next, he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt. This was really hard for me because I spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer, always hunched over. I even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after I started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients. Again, I noticed immediate results. I actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob! No lay thought because of last minute resistance

The one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety. I had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all. He had me watch episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white. This did not come easy but I worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable. This turned out to be the tipping point and I finally started getting laid regularly when I go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before. Overall, I'm very happy to have fucked 15 girls. I know that's not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it's a big improvement over ZERO.

Thats kind of the level Im at right now. The girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but Ive gotten a 7 before, mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing. The quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily, I already had a plate I was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan, so Im not wanting for sex, just spending my days reading and learning as much as I can about working out and nutrition since I got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up.

4075,4076,"Talk To Women - Keep It SiimpleDon't make the male/female interaction more complicated than what it has to be.

Eye contact

Greet

Small Talk

Farewell/Contact Info

Get out of your head, be in the present moment, and pay attention to your environment and the person in front of you.

Eye contact is how women convey interest.  If she locks eye contact with you, chances are she's interested enough to at least talk to you.  Master eye contact and you'll notice you're having more and more success with women.

Greetings are very natural and gives off a warm vibe.  Don't try to sound sexy or cool.  A ""good morning"" with good eye contact will get you better results than trying to be funny, interesting or cool.  Especially if you see the person frequently.

Small talk is when you can throw in your wittiness.

Her: ""Every time I see you you're drinking coffee""

You: ""So how long have you had your eye on me?"" said with a smile.

Don't expect fireworks, just observe her reaction.

Farewells don't require a hug or a kiss.  I know ""kiss closing"" is your goal, but you could kiss somebody today and she could be kissing someone new tomorrow.  It's not an accomplishment.  If you want to speak to her again, just get her social media info or phone number.  With social media, you can see what kind of person she is a little more.  You'll know if it has the potential to go further than a one-night stand or not if you actually do get to fuck.

You can be plenty feminine in jeans as well. I know a lot of the world considers them comfy. I love them and wear them a lot but dont see how anyone thinks theyre comfy. All you need is a girly top and some heels or ankle boots. You definitely never need to sacrifice comfort for femininity.",0

4098,4099,"Should be legal, but the industry should be better regulated to ensure that none of the performers are being exploited. Particularly for young and naive girls, the porn industry can be so brutal. Few actors are able to make a real career of it, and any involvement leads you down a path where society shuns you. There is no such thing as only doing porn for a few years to get you through college, but that's an idea that some people seem to have when they do it. When porn comes up in your background check, you aren't getting the job, and now there's barely any money in porn at all. Free porn is everywhere, and this has a serious impact on actor pay.

&#x200B;

You can't stop porn. It's fundamentally an agreement between several consenting adults, to perform an act, usually for monetary compensation, but there are some couples who do it because that's their thing. If people are consenting to doing it, and people are consenting to watching, and nobody is being unduly harmed by anyone else, then who I am to stop it. That said, I think we should produce and consume much less of it. It's already proven to have a bad impact on the mental health and sexual performance of those who consume it too often, and it's been show to have addictive properties.",0

This is going to sound off of me, but it's been covered by real documentaries, notably a series on sex work by channel four, but there is a problem in the sex work industry of women from poor(er) countries coming in and undercutting the whole market. They don't know what their bodies are worth, so they undersell them, and it brings the whole market price down, screwing everyone. One line that stuck with me was that in this one city in the UK, it used to be that you could go to that seedy part of town and pay someone 20 for a blowjob, but then a load of poor eastern european women arrived and started selling anal for 5, and literally anything goes for 10/hour. It wrecked the whole scene. It makes an industry already susceptible to exploitation and corruption, even more exploitative.",0

4102,4103,"Negative. It normalizes violence in relationships, encourages misogyny in non sexual situations, and the majority of it is produced with coercion, human trafficking  and blackmailing. It also has a whole host of negative effects on the brain, and is like a drug addiction. It starts out vanilla but in order to get off the person will need more and more severe shot.  Also the vast majority of porn sites are all owned by one company Mindgeek, and all of its sites have had countless cases of their being videos of actual rapes, videos of minors, and even if toddlers being abused on it that they either refused to take down or only took down once a lawyer was brought in.  There is also the fact that people are being exposed younger and younger to it, the average age being 8-11. 

Most people ik were exposed at around 9 or 10, and that was years ago. 


Masturbation itself isn't bad, but its more the port industry and how porn messes people up. Areas with onlyfans its a parasocial relationship that doesn't use trafficking and doesn't seem to be anywhere near as violent.

""Why are you playing games with women""

This is a game that women play with men all the time.  When a man does it back to her, it disarms her.

I wrote a post called  [**How To Be Charismatic With Confidence Coming Out Of Your Pores**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/how-to-be-charismatic-with-confidence-coming-out-of-your-pores/) and it's with the elements I mention in that post and what I'm about to share with you is gonna give you an unfair advantage over your male competition when it comes to women.

So how do you tease a woman?  First and foremost, stop being thirsty to fuck.  Second, this is not teasing that goes nowhere.  The more you tease her, the more intrigued she becomes and the more she will keep you out of the friend zone.

Don't give a woman everything she wants.  When you give her everything she wants, she will start to get bored.  Keep your conversations short.  When the both of you hang out, she will enjoy your time so much more.  So if you only hang out with her for just 10-15 minutes at a time, the more she starts having feelings for you, the longer she's gonna want to spend time with you.

Her: ""What?  You have to leave?  You just got here!"" in a whiny voice.

You: ""Yeah.  I gotta go.  I have to leave for work tomorrow""

Her: ""Wanna spend the night?  I can wash what you're  wearing so you can have something clean for work tomorrow""

This is an example, don't expect this to happen exactly like this.  But you get the idea.  When a woman starts making accommodations for you to spend more time with her, she is doing what men want women to do when they ask her on a date.

Remember that women make time and switch things around for men they're attracted to.  The more desire you build up in her, the less resistance she'll have.  If she's suppose to hang out with her girls, she'll do it earlier or later to make time for you.

If you learn how to focus on building the desire in her, you won't have to worry about sleeping with her... she'll do her best to make sure that it's gonna happen.",1

Long answer, I moved countries so I do not know if my experience is relevant.

But in general as a POC italian woman, I remedy my alienation by participating in italian feminists spaces online, and following newspapers aligned with my political views, and participating in politics where I can, just feeling useful somewhat.

Then since italian feminism or politics isn't very intersectional I go to YouTube to find POC that talk about their specific problems or deconstruct society as they see it.",0
4180,4181,Thank you for contributing to intersectional feminism!,0
4181,4182,"As a South Asian woman who moved to Europe, I can relate to how you feel. 

In my home country, I come across as 'ultra-modern', and in my country of residence, it took me two years to exactly grasp what 'subtle sexism' as opposed to 'overt sexism' looks like. I find it difficult to discuss my issues in the feminist groups I've been part of - their solutions would not touch on the nuances of culture that I experience. 

Online, Reddit as a whole is very US-centric. What has helped me was to join some women-centric groups from my home country - these are not naturally feminist groups, but they give a sense of relatedness. I also follow some accounts on IG from the expat communities. This helps me feel that I'm not alone in my struggles.

I think you should still state your struggles - and open up the broader discussion that feminism and sexism are at different stages around the world. Happy to lend a listening ear anytime you want.",0
4182,4183,"I am in a similar situation except I have not been able to find a support group. My views are too ""radical"" for my home country and ""not relevant"" to my adoptive country.  It's great to know you have found some relatedness.  


Where do you think would be the appropriate place for expats to express their feelings on feminism?  I feel like I can only support local (i.e. of my adoptive country) feminism and not actively suggest things as I did not experience sexism in the same way as them.",0
4183,4184,"I think there are similar experiences that can be shared with local feminist groups as an expat. A common, unifying theme for me has been experiences in the workplace. Ive come to also realize, sadly, that I cannot expect all feminists to be intersectional. I had a wonderful feminist advisor (who I still respect) who recoiled when I started talking about racial microaggression. 

I very much wish I could discuss feminism with women from my own cultural background who are also expats. I have not cracked the code for this yet.",0
4184,4185,"I totally understand what you feel. But its also important to realise that intersectionality in feminism is so important. The fact that we mostly read and discuss Western feminism is a part of the post colonial discourse. There is a still a soft culture in academia about the Western understanding of feminism. And the fact that we often feel alienated from the discussions in our home as well as overseas is because we dont take multitudes of lived realities into account. Even if we do, we dont hear much about it and its often exoticized and seen as something bizarre  in the West. Its so frustrating because women from third world countries are assumed to achieve the feminist discourse in the West. The cultural nuances are completely disregarded. The collective voices of women from the third world heard. There is need to engage with lived experiences of multitude of women from diverse cultures and classes. Patriarchy affects us all but it affects some more disproportionately than others. Feminism at the outset should account for this. So, we dont feel an outsider in a struggle that is for all the women around the world !",0
4185,4186,"As a white intersectional feminist who has a number of PoC loved ones, some of whom are from colonised countries or simply countries with very different backgrounds, I recognise this isnt my place to respond to, but I hope I can welcome you (as a migrant, I know moving country and splitting your time between countries can be difficult in ways there arent words for; please know at least other ex-pats get it) and share some things Ive found helpful, for what theyre worth. 

I have found civil rights leaders from all sorts of movements but especially anti-racist and anti-colonialist movements super inspiring. Womanists, the largely black PoC women who led the intersectional movement, guided my growth and understanding of how to act right, and all errors I make are my own. 

I found treating the women that grew up rooted in sexism with respect paid dividends. Women have always found ways to live around sexism, whether they acknowledged it or not. Even the most hide-bound culture has ways for people to let off steam. It may not be worth preserving, necessarily, but it is worth understanding.

You may find that you are the person best placed to write or speak about feminism in your home country, or intersectionality in your adopted country. But you dont have to do anything, and you are not alone, not ever. Even if there are few out and out feminists in your home country, there are surely more women who are sympathetic to it; native feminists in your adoptive country may not understand directly, but if theyre half decent and your friends theyll set themselves to understanding. 

Some groups I think you might have luck feeling at home with are 1) other women who have migrated from your home to your adopted country; 2) feminists from countries neighbouring or similar to your home country; 3) groups of immigrant feminists, without specific countries of origin, because some experiences are common. 

A very modern experience is trying to make friends with a number of different groups so as to satisfy the aches and needs that arise in us. Its a very lonely world (and perhaps foolish) but one hopes we can work on that, too.",0

If someone who is afraid of women was told just do it with no social skills, they will have a bad experience and further push them away from approaching. Theres a process that needs to happen well before actually trying to overcome the fear.

4241,4242,"I don't know that you can make her chase you per se..  you are the guy and as a result you will always have to make the first (and every) move.  You just want to maintain your frame as a calm, confident guy and escalate physically from being platonic.  More importantly, the time to act on things is when they feel right.  The time for a funny comment about her kissing you, is in response to when she brings it up.  The easiest time to escalate physically is if you're already dancing with her and physically close, etc.

From the little I know about your situation, it's tough to say where you stand.  But bottom line is that women like a witty, confident guy who doesnt seek their approval and presents as a challenge.  Live your best life, study/work, lift weights, meditate, avoid porn, etc.  Internalize the traits while improving your life with the above work ethic and you will be attractive to most women.

With THIS girl specifically, if she's attracted you already, then you have to escalate your relationship from platonic to physical.  If she is into you , but doesnt see you as a guy who has the balls to act on his desires... you will be permanently friendzoned.  Hopefully that's not where you are.  

Regardless, just live your life, have fun, tease her when you can, and don't try too hard.  Create sexual tension in situations where you can (look it up if you dont know what it means).  Break the touch barrier with non-threatening touch;  elbow, small of back, back of hand, etc.  Keep strong eye contact if you dont already, and a hint of a smile is also a good bet.  But most importantly, ACT when you have an opportunity;  to tease her, to escalate physically, etc.  Use the opportunities when she compliments you, to escalate and banter.  E.g. If she says she was into you the other day or compliments your dancing, you can say something like ""I dont blame you..  I actually had to turn it down a notch, I didn't want you to lose control"".  In other words, tease her when she compliments herself and agree with her in a cocky way when she compliments you.  Use your own words and style, they matter way less than your actions, body language and ultimately your balls to act.  Dont pass up good opportunities to act and escalate physically, sometimes they dont come again...",0

She laughed when I did it. I touch her at every opportunity like high-five, rubbing her shoulder to console her when I tease her etc but she never touches me back. We have very good flirtation with every opportunity. I just am scared to escalate and spoil it if she turns me down if I go in for a kiss. It'll just make me very low value cos I always tease her saying ""we never get along as a couple"" and trying or going for the kiss would not be congruent",0

Women are killing themselve 4x as much according to you, and also being too indecisive to actually do it. You cant Balme toxic masculinity now all of a sudden, if it is female mental health care that is in crisis according to you!

You see im not letting feminism have it both ways. And BTW the incidence of female suicide attempts is so high is one because of borderline personality disorder in women (they are not actually trying to kill themselves, although sometimes they accidentally do) and also basic stats that feminists often cant understand.... obviously if women aren't able to actually kill themselves the number of attempts per year (there's men and women, much more so women who attempt like 300x a year) will be high vs a man 1 attempt and he actually kills himself.

if feminist bang on about men being responsible for violence, then sure, but that means on the whole they are responsible for inventing everything, discovering everything, exploring and pushing frontiers for humanity (oceans, space, new countries, continents, arctic, desserts etc), fine art, music, film, history, culture, billionaires, Nobel prize winners, billionaires and leaders... leaders even in female dominated industries and female activities such as fashion, shopping, makeup, cooking (so feminists can complain its because women are a minority, as men are a minority there and face social taboo in those fields but still end up on top)

My class had a debate on zoom today, and I struggled with public speaking (as usual). One girl had her microphone on & she laughed at me when I stuttered for a moment & forgot my argument. Everyone in my class thinks I'm massively retarded, and they will speak over me or completely ignore me. 

During the debate this one guy kept picking on me and being rude/ condescending. I noticed a stark difference in the way he spoke to me v.s the prettiest girls in class. It is pure suifuel, & makes me feel like complete shit

Our professor asked us how the debate went at the end of class. This one girl from my group (who really dislikes me) openly stated that ""certain people"" in our group are ""incredibly frustrating"" and she ""couldn't stand"" listening to them. Those were her words, almost verbatim. Everyone just laughed...but it was clear she was talking about me. There are only THREE ppl in our group. I don't know why she had to be so nasty and passive aggressive. I am nothing but nice to her. I guess ugly people are garbage though & worthy of no respect 

 I waited until the zoom session ended to speak with my teacher about my struggles with class participation/ public speaking. I immediately choked up and stated to cry before I could say 2 words. My teacher just sat there with this awkward smile on her face and asked if I wanted to ""come back in 2 minutes.""

We then had this INCREDIBLY awkward conversation. It felt like I was holding her hostage lol. Even my own teacher thinks I'm a creepy weirdo. I explained my autism & struggles with social anxiety, and she suddenly started talking about how many students find the course material"" unfamiliar"" and ""intimidating.""

You  are going to grow up so, so resilient in ways that these kids will not.  It hurts and I know it's barely any comfort, but honestly, you are  going to be /so/ prepared for the knock-backs in life. You're having to  claw your way into recognition and being taken seriously - what happens  to these pretty people when that starts to fade?

One  of the biggest lessons I've had to teach myself (more due to abusive  father/controlling dynamics, but same theory applies) is to be  warm-blooded, not cold-blooded.

Cold-blooded  people need constant validation from those around them - they seek it  to warm themselves, they're always yearning for what others can give  them. Warm-blooded people find validation and comfort within themselves,  they understand their value and radiate with it, they don't need  outside comforts or input.

>given we have two guys with equal looks the guy with better social skills is always gonna win

Sure I agree with you. But most of the times people aren't equally good-looking in which case the better-looking guy is always going to win because personality won't compensate for looks.

>being a shut-in introvert your entire childhood puts you at a massive disadvantage in dating

How? 80% of rejections happen in the first 5 seconds of an interaction. You can immediately see the way a girl responds to you in the first few seconds if she's gonna let you flirt with her or not. If she doesn't like the way you look she's just gonna give you one-word replies, put on a bitch-face and have negative body language. Good luck flirting with that.

I had horrible experience in dating with women before. All went sour because I was too needy.   
Thanks everyone on this sub.  


The push and pull technique really worked! And for me, it's the best method to get women.  
Women are more driven by emotion than logic. They get ""aroused"" when they get  curious about you.  
I gave her different signals. I am not predictable. I made sure she is always confused.  


I stopped obsessing about her. Before, I was checking her online status and social medias 24/7.  
I went out to play soccer/football, get a job, kept myself busy and play video games to stop being needy all the time. I realized I was talking and chatting her through the phone all day.

When I read about this sub, I immidietly stopped that hobby. 

She got attached to me because we were constantly chatting, so I decided to ""push"" her away by not replying her messages instantly. Declined her coffee and pizza invitations. Declined to play video games with her. I didn't make myself available all the time. Now she is thinking about me. 

Then I make my self available and chat to her always, then again go cold for a while - repeat. Making her really confused. ""Does he like me or not?""


This created more attraction.   
But it's really hard to control yourself. I just made myself busy to stop being needy.
 
Never confess your feelings to your crush. Why? Because she gets bored, she is no longer curious because she already got the answer.
When women fall in love to you, they become ""obssesed"". They no longer give a shit to your wealth and physical appearance.",1
4360,4361,Good strategy.,0
4361,4362,"I hope that when you declined her invitations, you gave legitimate reasons and offered to reschedule. Otherwise, many women would assume youre not interested and move on.",0
4362,4363,"This is the key to making a relationship last and to getting girls wet over you.

Girls like emotion, they like uncertainty. Don't constantly shower her with attention. Sometimes when I'm texting my girlfriend, I say that I'm busy today and that I'll get back to her later. Sometimes I'll act a little cold and she'll immediately start wondering why. It keeps her curious and engaged.

One day you want her to feel happy, the next sad, the next a little angry, and the next day you want her horny.

Keeping a cycle of emotions going is the best thing you can do to have her go crazy for you.",1
4363,4364,This sounds incredibly manipulative?,0
4364,4365,No its a roller coster with emotions. Manipulation is when u make someone do something for you,0
4365,4366,"You can manipulate someone into doing something for you but you can also manipulate their emotions into feeling a certain way - like the commenter said how one day you want her to feel angry and the next sad etc. I can see how this would keep things exciting or keep someone on their toes but I dont think its healthy to give someone the cold shoulder and to purposefully make them feel sad so they want you more. I support the notion that it can be good to have distance and separation in a relationship and that regular contact can lead to someone taking you for granted, but I dont agree with upsetting your partner on purpose for personal gain",0
4366,4367,But this can be beneficial for the rs in a some way,0
4367,4368,"It's not, you just don't wanna constantly baby her. If you do she'll get bored real soon. If you treat her the same, she'll be the one manipulating you and then leaving you.

It's not keant to hurt her, it's just a method of building attraction and interest.",0
4368,4369,"I completely agree that separation and unavailability can build attraction and interest, but I dont think it needs to be done via the method the original commenter mentioned. The method of purposefully making someone sad doesnt benefit the person thats being hurt, it only benefits the one doing the hurting and thats selfish


It may not mean to hurt the person, but purposefully making someone else sad does hurt them and it taints their entire day

You can still be a loving and supportive partner while being unavailable, you dont need to be cold or hurtful or closed off emotionally, and I dont agree that consistently showing someone you care about them is babying them, I think its the foundation to a secure and healthy relationship. 

Would you want to be with someone that is overly affectionate and loving one day and the next it seems like they dont give a toss about you? It may make you want to be closer to your partner, but is that healthy?",0
4369,4370,"A lesson I learned from a stranger on the busThis past winter, I was riding the bus consistently to a new job in a new city. I'm a nurse, and the transition was stressful, and the shifts were long and the mornings were dark, early, damp, and cold. There was a woman who would ride the same bus at the same time as me, and although we never exchanged a word, she has made a lasting impact on me, and I find myself thinking of her often. I wanted to share my experience with you ladies. 

This woman was an average woman, likely in her 50s, with a rather plain face, plain clothes, and sometimes rather disheveled. She often sat across from me, with muddy rain boots, and hair slightly askew from wind and rain. Every other person on the bus was either sleeping, or on their phone, scowling, irritable, and cold. 

But this woman wore a smile. Her expression was always soft, inviting, friendly, and she had a peaceful presence about her that was mesmerizing and downright fascinating. She was beautiful, warm, and kind. She never looked impatient, she never scowled down at a phone screen, she would not look away when I met her gaze but would smile sweetly at me, and I would smile back. We shared these rides together in silence, and I found myself smiling too. I would look out the window as the first traces of light came up through the treetops, and I would find stillness in an otherwise stressful commute. 

Then, as weeks passed, I noticed a shift in my own behavior. I noticed myself smiling at work, among coworkers who were stressed, anxious, and exhausted. I noticed that I could make the people around me laugh, and smile too, and maybe even complain less. My patients seemed to smile more as well,  despite their suffering and fear. I noticed that I would catch myself smiling while standing in line at the grocery store, or while doing the dishes, or weeding. I would smile in the car, when going on rides with my partner.

And as the world has changed through this pandemic, as people have begun social distancing, and fearing not only the virus but one another, smiles have seemed to disappear altogether, mask or no mask. 

Whether you cover your face or not, smile more. Smile for yourself, smile with your eyes. It will change your life, it might change someone else's. It is feminine, it is gentle, it is kind. It seems we need more of that these days than ever.",0
4370,4371,:) That is a lovely reminder.,0
4371,4372,"This is beautiful! In my mind your story played out like a movie and the ladys face was a monk/nun named Pema Chodron, who I adore. That lady  got on that bus everyday as your teacher, and you were an excellent student!",0
4372,4373,my wife did this when she was 17 when she entered the classroom.  oh my god it got my attention.  told her i was attracted to her.  the rest is history - still happily with her now 27 years later.,0
4373,4374,"Remember this lesson for the rest of your life.  You can control how to feel and how you emotionally respond to things even while you can't always control what happens in your life. **No one else can make you feel bad, you have to let them.**

Too often I hear from friends and acquaintances that their partner doesn't make them happy.  That's not their job, that's yours and you can control how you feel.

Congrats on this btw.  I honestly think most people never figure this out - they let others or circumstances dictate how they feel.",0

4379,4380,"When Abundance Mentality isn't enough to fight Oneitis?Even if I'm talking to or dating multiple girls, and I have the options that I need for this ""abundance mentality"" concept, there is *always* that one girl that I just meld with more than the others; perhaps even more than with any of my past partners too.

The oxytocin, dopamine, and whatever crazy chemical shit that goes on up in my neurons hits me like a tornado after two or three hookups with this person.

I tell myself to snap out of it. ""Abundance mentality, man! You're going on dates with different women each week, you're texting dozens at the same time, pull your shit together!""

But my mind wanders off. I lose motivation to pursue those other prospects available to me. I feel physically odd; those familiar ropes of infatuation and attachment tying themselves into a knot deep in my core.

I try to distract myself with work, hobbies, and exercise. But those are only distractions, and the thoughts and knots come back any time I'm idle.

How the fuck do you deal with it when ""abundance mentality"" isn't working?",0
4380,4381,"I kind of am in the same situation, and lose interest in pursuing other girls since most things are great with one particular girl.

4383,4384,">Are you hooking up with that girl?

Yes.

No. Love doesn't happen that quickly. And for those who feel it does, I question their mental stability. 

>Oneitis happens when you don't get the girl and get obsessed with her because you don't have her.

Which in this case could be the potential of not ""having"" her because there's no commitment. Which is a strange bit of cognitive dissonance as I have no goals of marriage. Having an exclusive partner/companion, yeah, but not any legal contractual bullshit. Or perhaps I'm misinterpereting the way she is around me and she's like that around all the guys she hooks up with. Or perhaps it's the fear of losing that connection and chemistry.",0

That's basically my life philosophy at the moment, but it starts to crumble at the ""If you want sex, you have sex"" part because, as a guy who can't just sit and wait looking pretty at the bar, it is damn hard to find a partner whenever you want. That plus the lack of trust in the self to accurately assess if that person *truly* thrills you plays a part in this, I think....",0
4387,4388,"Having good chemistry with one specific person isn't one-itis.

4388,4389,That's a great point that needs to be reiterated in the seduction community,0
4389,4390,"MGTOW isn't a niche group anymore. MGTOW is becoming the norm.Based on the number of cases, studies and articles in power imbalance, in divorce cases, in percentages of relationships/marriages failing, in double standards, the adele divorce case, the Johnny Depp case... men have realized the following:

1 - The term *SIMP* has achieved a global status (i would not be surprised that it would be included in the dictionary sometime in the future). This means that a conscious realization has occurred, and for it having such a mass appeal worldwide, it means that it isn't just cultural relativism/subjectivism. Millions of men have suffered through the dichotomy of -> Conquering Women = Suffering, otherwise the term *SIMP* needn't be so sucessful;

2 - With the pragmatic, yet flawed, #METOO movement, men have spoken how much they suffered from this view of trying to be with women. This point with 1 has something in common: Something is really all fucked concerning approaching women. ""*This shouldn't be so difficult...so why is it? Is it me that's the problem?"";*

3 - Seeing so many men suffering from this exact way (and it not need mattering if a man is a 2/10 or a 10/10. Suffering from women is human condition on heterosexual men, it seems) and ourselves just being tired of trying and being better ourselves everyday to reach that goal of having everlasting love with a woman, we reach a conclusion: *Something is definitely not right about relationships/women nowadays* (otherwise there wouldn't be so many niche groups like mgtow/men's rights/whereareallthegoodmen. It's reactionary and even error theory assuming that ""*we're all losers and incels"". Correlation doesn't mean Causation*, however, when that correlation continues to go on without stopping, a conclusion has to be made);

4 - With such a conclusion, we go searching for more information: We find books (the manipulated men, the rational male, the works of Briffault), we find articles (divorce rapes, cheating scandals, emotional bullying cases), and, eventually, this kind of subreddit, MGTOW (maybe TRP). With the axioms that these subreddits apply...well, they just make sense. Everything fits. We start to connect the pieces. Briffaults's Law, Hypergamy, Monkey Branching, abandoning relationships for no reason, Shit Tests...It's impossible for this to be just me! Every guy i've known has suffered through the exact same way. So we start talking to our male friends... and we all agree on these premisses.

5 - We, naturally, keep reading and being informed about this. We start living without the necessity of having a girlfriend, a woman in our lives, and just stop (or limit) our necessity of approaching women. We start to live more. We are more sane. We are healthier (some of us even go to the gym!). We start taking care of ourselves for ourselves. We start not caring about social media.

6 - Now that we are a better person and know these truths about modernity, and are simply better not caring about women (although this is really difficult and only a select few can outright not have that human condition pull on women), we start not giving a crap. Women start complaining that we are not paying attention or that we have become lazy. Feminism and social media start using debilitating words like *Incel, Loser* or *Beta* to shame test us (like we haven't predicted that by this point). You know, a typical Strawmen/Ad Hominem.

7 - The cycle repeats here. Now, with our knowledge about this concern, we appropriate other males that give attention to other females to have sexual needs validated (onlyfans, twitch girls, youtube girls, e-girls) and call them by reason, to wake them up. ""Why do you think that onlyfans exploded? It's not because they can't get employability or good jobs. It's not because it's ""difficult"" out there. Prosmicuity and sexual themes have exploded in the past decade, and females are the bread winner. They can have their cake and eat it. They can have more sexual partners and be paid for it, without having any beneficial labour for the rest of society. They can go on any social dating app and just pick. *You are NOT going to have sex with her*.""

4448,4449,Does the patriarchy and toxic masculinity cause men to experience loneliness at higher rates and more severity? Has this lead to the rise of incel movements?Incel is slang for Involuntarily Celibate.,0
4449,4450,"I don't think, that incels are more lonely than anyone else. The difference is, that they have a scapegoat for it.",0
4450,4451,"Yes. Maybe, and men only have themselves to blame. 

To answer your first question, research in the US shows older widows return from grief more easily than widowers, because women are more likely to hold the burden of keeping social networks alive. ([Source 1](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/56/1/S56/546685) [Source 2](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=widower+loneliness&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DBPk5Uv_P2e4J)). When their husbands pass, theyre far more likely to have their network to lean on and come comfort them. What do you think happens to the husbands whose wives arranged their social calendar for the last 30 years?

Toxic masculinity dissuades boys from working with their friends to process emotions. Whereas women and girls *define* friendships by how vulnerable they can be with each other. 

So, men grow up thinking a romantic relationship is the space where you can be open about your emotions. Oftentimes they dump all their lives emotional baggage on their partner, which is bad for the female partner who expects to *share* this work. But worse, how many years can a man go without that space where he can process how hes dealing with life stress? 

If a man never learns the tools to process everyday emotions, and never had a friendship where they felt open doing so, I have no doubt they can turn bitter and violently lash out at women.",0
4451,4452,[deleted],0
4452,4453,"What? Who does something because they *don't* enjoy doing it? 

Not the OP, but I'd say they do it because they are expected to which has nothing to do with enjoyment or lacktherof. That's what makes it burdensome. It's a job that falls on women in cishet relationships whether they ask for it or not.  Also, considering women are individuals, it's very likely that the work of keeping up social connections for 2 people is burdensome to a few and difficult even for the ones who enjoy it.",0
4453,4454,"Shes referring to emotional labor, which is a burden. Generally, women are tasked with remembering birthdays / gift giving, catering to loved-ones, listening to partners woes (emotional support), setting up play dates, going to school functions, or dinner parties etc. All this requires maintenance of their social network, which is work.",0
4454,4455,[deleted],0
4455,4456,"It's not that it makes them more lonely, it's that it the affects of the patriarchy on men is different and manifests differently between men and women.



All people suffer from alienation and loneliness. It's just that mens form makes them more likely to (wrongly) consider feminism as an enemy rather than a solution, and to ignore things that can actually help them (like self reflection in order to counter toxic masculinity).


It's also that there haven't been many male-liberation movements that have been openly feminist, most have been about reinforcing the patriarchy on themselves further. It's also that most male-led feminist movements have been very openly radical, openly marxist feminist, meaning men have further considered them as enemy rather than a solution to the problems of patriarchy",0

4495,4496,"The Second Arrow  Currently there's an interesting AMA featuring Dr. Laurie Santos, host of the happiness lab. One of her replies contained an old parable I'd learned years ago but had forgotten till I read that thread. For those that struggle with self confidence; insecurities and negative self talk; this was her reply;

*Thats a hard one, as I incorporate a lot of the tips I share with my students from meditation to exercise to trying to protect my time affluence.*

*But if I had to pick one, Id say the most important insight comes from the fact that that we can control our reactions to the bad situations in life. Its an insight that comes from the ancient stoics but also from the Buddhist parable of the second arrow. Which goes something like this Buddha asks his followers if its bad to get hit with an arrow when youre walking down the street, which they quicky agree it is. Then he asks if its worse to get hit with a second arrow. All the followers agree that yup, getting hit with two arrows would suck more. Buddha goes on to explain that the first arrow is our of our control thats all the bad stuff that happens to us in life. But the second arrow is our reaction to those bad events whether we get angry or upset and make things worse. That second arrow is always up to us.*

*And so Id say the biggest insight thats had a positive effect on my own life is NOT to hit myself with that second arrow.* - Dr Laurie Santos 

During my teens I grew up with fairly high expectations. At the time I was expected to work, excel at studies and then contribute wherever else I was required. It's a gruelling weight to bear when there's so much expectation. I was drinking with my uncles and cousins one time and after relaying my woes; one uncle told me not keep shooting myself with *the second arrow*. He then told that same story. At the time I had a deep seeded doubt that the path I was forced upon; I wasn't up to. Insecurities, self doubt and my negative internal dialogue were eroding my confidence. Gaining that perspective however, then applying it; changed my world view. It irrevocably changed my frame. 

We all face adversity. Frame; and the base of its strength comes from a choice. We don't have a choice getting shot with the first arrow; **but we CAN consciously chose not to shoot ourselves with the second arrow.**

4505,4506,"[Censorship]/[Opinion] Robert DesJarlait: ""My Native American father drew the Land OLakes maiden. She was never a stereotype.""",0
4506,4507,"This opinion piece was published on *WaPo* and penned by the son of the artist behind the Land O'Lakes maiden. And what he describes is all too recognizable:

>North Dakota state Rep. Ruth Buffalo (D), for instance, [told](https://archive.li/o/0RdcR/https://www.twincities.com/2020/04/15/land-olakes-makes-over-packaging-does-away-with-indian-maiden-logo/) the Pioneer Press in St. Paul, Minn., that the Land OLakes image of Mia went hand-in-hand with human and sex trafficking of our women and girls  by depicting Native women as sex objects. Others similarly welcomed the companys removal of the butter maiden as long overdue.  
>  
>How did Mia go from being a demur Native American woman on a lakeshore to a sex object tied to the trafficking of native women?

 While the author, by his own admission, ""participated in protests against mascots and logos using American Indian images in the early 1990s, including outside the Metrodome in Minneapolis when Washingtons team played the Buffalo Bills in the 1992 Super Bowl"" he realized just how hypocritical the censorship being pushed is.

>Mias vanishing has prompted a social media meme: They Got Rid of The Indian and Kept the Land. That isnt too far from the truth. Mia, the stereotype that wasnt, leaves behind a landscape voided of identity and history. For those of us who are American Indian, its a history that is all too familiar.",0

4511,4512,"That's a more charitable reading than mine, I don't get the idea that he's conflicted at all, the whole article seems dedicated to explaining why *it's different in this case, because ~~it's my dad's work~~ reasons.*

4557,4558,"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 05, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

###Physical

Goal: don't just *maintain muscle, gain muscle* over the next 60 days. 

Measurement: post cropped before and after pics as evidence.

Day 1 http://imgur.com/a/HT3NZYY

Week 1: 207lbs ~22%BF

Week 2: 201lbs ~20%BF

Week 3: 198lbs ~19%BF

Week 4/Day 30: 195lbs https://imgur.com/a/waZTVe6

Week 5: 192lbs ~ 17%BF

Week 6: 192lbs ~ 17%BF

Diet goal is to hit sub 12% BF during the Time Of No Lifts, sub 15% BF by end of #60DoD.

I'm eating healthy and 1000+ below my TDEE, OMAD except one or two days a week after morning workouts, protein is staying up at 1-1.5g/lb body weight per day, but my body seems to have decided that it wants to stick at 192lbs. I've lost 15lbs in the last 6 weeks but I've got another 12lbs to go to hit sub 12% BF and 7lbs to hit a true sub 15%. I'm about to go back into full Keto OMAD as I'm frustrated with the stall, I'm basically looking for some advice from guys who have done quick cuts like this 60 day one I'm doing now. Do I just soldier through with the low calorie count? My primary concern is to finish dropping this fucking fat and meet my BF% goal. If I lose a little muscle as well, fuck it, I can build it back better later from sub 12%. 

Thanks for the help bros

###Financial

I will find and buy a nice pair of shoes. 

###Professional

""I will update my resume with my new experience in preparation for promotion opportunities.""

I've put together a list of what I've accomplished of significance over the last 3 months to be refined into my resume. 7 things that those responsible for selecting the promotion would appreciate in a candidate.

###Social

I got halfway through writing out a mini FR for each date, and then realized the dates themselves don't matter. The girls don't matter. What does is what I learned about myself from them. 

I learned that me being ""me with MRP"" works just fine, most women eat that shit up, and those who don't seem to be unbalanced in some way, or else I showed too much weakness and they smelled it. 

I learned that I can more and more frequently think fast enough to frame myself positively while in the flow of conversation without lying, and if I can't I can change the subject, STFU, or AA AM PF. I'm learning that most of that I do automatically, its not a ""thinking it through"" kind of thing. You either do it or you don't. It's got to be natural, not forced. If it isn't, STFU.

I still talk way, way too much. 

I default to comfort/Beta behaviors so I have to constantly keep my focus on creating DHV/Alpha display opportunities and on that mindset, because the Beta comes through on its own. I also am successfully eliminating many low value Beta behaviors and sticking to more ""oakish"" and higher value ones. 

My attitude with these girls now is basically ""I'm interested in learning a bit about you to see if I think there's the possibility for more, but IDGAF if you reciprocate, and if you misbehave, bye because I've got better shit than this to be doing, this is for fun *for me*, and there's literally girls who wish they were out with me/talking/chatting tonight instead of you"" (this is not something that's spoken, its just my attitude. I'm not rude but I'm pretty clear about covertly signaling that they have stiff competition and about not caring if they like my personality or not)

###Mental

MRP fixes the man, and I've decided that I am a man worth the effort to fix. Even with how little work I've done so far, I have value. I am my prize no matter what anyone else thinks about how I'm living my life or the choices I make. Fuck who I let myself become with my ex, that guy was a butthurt dick who blamed everyone else for how his life was turning out. I'm better than that. The past is a lesson that doesn't define who I am or will become. 

*But* - that guy doesn't ever disappear. He's always there, waiting for me to get tired or lazy, so he can take over again. He mocks me with catcalls of ""its so nice to just relax and not be so *busy* all the time "" ""this soda is delicious, especially when paired with these French fries "" ""this videogame/movie is awesome! So glad I decided to spend hours of my life on this "" He is constantly testing my resolve. 

There is a ton of work to do. I have drive and high standards for myself, but like everyone else I avoid the hardest internal work and seem to be at my best when focused on one or two areas at a time. For the last 3 months that focus has been work and has now shifted to work and plating. 

I've been attempting to establish my career and my ""single life"" at the expense of my most critical internal work and my children. The first is not such a bad thing, a short term push for long term gains, the second I still feel has been necessary to figure out what I need to be focused on internally, I get constant data about my mental state from how I react to women. I've also needed the external motivation in my current frame-less faggot mode of being... That being said there hasn't been any wasted effort, just lessons, and groundwork laid for next steps in my journey. 

###Marriage

I've been making STBX calm down 3yo before bringing her to me for bed on my nights if 3yo isn't already with me as I wind down, because STBX lets 3yo stay up while she plays video games on STBX's nights, despite me telling her she needs to give 3yo a reasonable bed time. 

I'm not dealing with the fall out of her poor choices, she can fix it herself and give me a reasonably behaving child, not a tantrum throwing mess getting dumped in my lap at 9pm when I'm going to bed so she can go visit Chad.

###Family

Playing with 3yo more regularly, engaging her and being present. 14yo I am playing a long game, most times when I get home she is playing online with friends. I offer to do things she likes, so far only once has she taken me up on the offer, but I'lltake it, and we both had fun. I'll seek to build on that experience. I also drag her outside on weekends, even if just for lunch in the backyard with my parents and a bit of play with her sister on the swing set. She ""hates it"" but has fun once forced away from the screens inside the house with a moment to adjust her attitude.

###Goals

Don't let on that I know about STBX indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (16 week streak)

Plating OPSEC (4 week streak)

Go to at least one Social activity without family. (5 week streak)

Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (11 week streak)",0

\#Wife:

Horrible failed shittests a few times this week. I blew up about her having too much control, or trying to have the final say on anything related to the kids. I pushed back, hard, told her the kids are 50/50 and that she no longer gets the final say. That if she thinks that she's the only one who decides what they can and cannot do... then court will give me 50% by law. I blew up way to fast, said some mean things, lost my frame. --- We had some great sex about an hour later though.

Finally got the form issue sorted with BP, hope to see more chest growth coming weeks. Compiled pictures of muscle development and see continuous progress since mid feb when I started. 

Got private boxing training from a friend which was great. Hoping to do this every week.

**Marriage/How not to do MRP**

Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good.

After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down  (crying and  asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed.

Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my  worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good.

Failings:

\- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit

\- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol)

\-  Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that)

\- No real OI when facing denial/indifference.

Success (I think)

\- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats.

\- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly)

\- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval)

\- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account"").

**Mental**

Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes.

**Sex**

After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz.   

**Family**

Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great.

**Social**

Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends.

**Week goals**

\- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success)

\- No losing calm at all (2 week success)

\- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend)

**Shit owning / Goals**

\- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue)

\- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week)

\- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot.

~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here.

~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though.

\- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame.

~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.)

\- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there)

**Mission**

*Not only star in the exciting film of life but direct it as well and make people want to co-cast.*

\- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle.

**Mission:**

Win each day.

**Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.*

* Cardio times three (Hill sprints, run, metcon)  these are for mental health more than anything. 
* Weights three sessions
* I go in energy cycles, for a few days Ill need less sleep, be more awake and I think have orgasms that dont feel as good, then Ill be more tired, sleep more, and my orgasms feel betternot sure what the fuck that means. 

**Separation:**

Ex is using daughter as bargaining chip. The mediation process has been surprisingly unbiased after I got rid of the first mediator. I have only done the intake session and Im sure they try and make you feel heard so Ill wait until we actually sit down to make a call. Im doing what needs to be done. If we go to court, I am ready but I suspect this is stressing me out more than I realize (see mood in mental). 

*Guilt*: this is still a major problem for me. My ex has stopped my overnights for no reason and I still feel guilty only paying the mandated child support. Even the mediator asked if I had considered only paying what Im legally required to pay. There are benefits to paying more, but I can't separate how much is guilt and how much is the benefits. 

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

I am trying to focus on just doing what I want. Not putting it through any filters (society or MRP) just what I want. I still need to be very careful with all the covert contracts etc but Im trying to act more authentically and noticing when the shit comes up so I can more quickly move into that space. 

*Mood*: Lower than it has been over the past few weeks. I still have periods of joy but mostly when with my daughter. Feeling more emotional I feel like crying for no reason, watched something sad in a movie, felt like crying... Still mood is better than before the T-Cream. I have been deliberately digging into painful memories/thought patterns and maybe that plus the worry about the STI and ex being a shit with court is wearing on me. Im not entirely sure. 

When feeling flat Im focusing on letting go of shoulds e.g. I should be driven and crushing life and instead just taking the next manageable step. This is helping keep me more productive on these days. E.g. one day I was feeling a bit lazy and annoyed at myself, I should be driven and motivated at all times. But thats bullshit and just uses mental energy on negative thought loops, instead I checked off the productive things I had already done; work, got blood taken, ate healthy and then I went and meditated for 20min and did hill sprints. Consistent forward progress. I will apply my mental energy to this rather than chastising myself for failing. 

*Anger*: I have a lot of it, Im pissed at what happened to my dad, pissed at what happened to me and pissed at my ex. I am struggling to manage my anger at my ex. She is driving us towards court for ridiculous reasons and wont get what she wants out of it. I am praying in the iron temple and upping the cardio, channeling my anger there is helping. Also, Im trying to change the narrative, when I find myself running a skit in my head I replace it with, you have all the big wins already and you are just going to keep building a great life. What do you want right now? 

*Needs*: something that resonated from NMMNG was having needs means being needy and needy represents a one-way ticket to abandonment. I am really starting to see how having emotions was met by a parent shutting down and how this is driving a lot of my current dysfunctional relationship patterns. 

*Caretaking*: this runs so deep, I see myself as the protector from life. I dont know what I have to offer apart from this. I feel like women wouldnt want me unless I provide this. Interestingly the thing thats helping the most is time alone in nature, I feel my life energy I just exist and thats when I feel most whole. Women can want this or not its up to them. But on some level I know its more attractive. Still, new mental models take a while to embed and this is a deep one for me.

*Goals*: last week u/[Blarg\_Risen](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blarg_Risen)  pointed out I need goals. I still need to do some work in this space but I wrote down my values/who I want to be, my 3 month objectives and longer term goals. I read this regularly and am finding it is helping me stay focused. 

**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*

I am present and calm with daughter, I enforce boundaries but give her as much space to experiment with life as I can. Im happy with this area. Current focus areas are: be present, calm, clear boundaries, enabling independent play and not letting my stress with ex leak over into our interactions.",0
4564,4565,"**Validation + (BF#8):** I made a blank profile on seeking arrangements basically its young hot (although some are neither) women looking for guys and ranges from looking for a weekly allowance to have your shit together. Either way, I was not looking seriously, didnt message anybody etc but thought if I do want to fuck a hot 19year old this might be an easy way and it was part of the validation experiment. I found myself falling much more into the validation or insecurity trap than I had with tinder. I was thinking things like; Im not successful/good enough for her, I dont have anything to offer and was thinking how I could position myself to be more what they wanted. Im not sure what the difference is with this or tinder. Im not sure if its validation or insecurity that driving this thinking. Not in a I want x outcome and therefore should do Y but really I dont give a shit about what anybody thinks, I did give a shit what they think. 

I clearly do not think Im the prize and still want women to want me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 15:** Identify emotional pukes. 

* Withdraw/sulk 
* Threaten to leave when I dont want to
* Get angry with them
* Escape fantasys 
* Ruminate and talk about what a shitty person they are
* Get sad/down

**Breaking Free Activity 16:** Put yourself first 

Hard in the circumstances, however I have noticed I consider other people a lot, especially ex in the mediation negotiations. I am just noticing these feelings and what comes up around it. I am trying to do a few more things just because I want to and again, noticing the feelings. 

**Breaking Free Activity 17:** Examples of how you used coping mechanisms in childhood/adult life for a smooth and problem free life. 

I didnt want to do this one but Im very glad I did. 

* Doing it right: In childhood I wasnt naughty I would follow the rules and do what was expected of me. As an adult I have to get things right, I have to do each part of my life correctly. 
* Playing it safe: As above for childhood. As an adult I dont do some of the things I want to do e.g. start a business/NGO, I take the safe and easy path e.g. current career. 
* Anticipating and fixing: as a child I would anticipate what would make teachers happy and do what they wanted rather than what I wanted to do. As an adult, in relationships, I anticipate what they might want and try and fix their problems for them. I feel responsible for other peoples happiness. 
* Trying not to rock the boat: as a child I was meek and quiet, I tried to please others, I never wanted attention on me. As an adults Ill often smooth things over with people particularly in relationships. I want to call someone on their bullshit but I dont to avoid causing problems. 
* Being charming and helpful: childhood  Im not sure if I used this one. Probably the helpful, as an adult fuck I love being helpful. 
* Never a moments problem: childhood basically the same as many of the others. As an adult, I try not to have any needs to avoid causing any problems, anything you want. I remember the first thing I did when I started lurking (fuck I should have just started OYS) was start to have an opinion, yes actually I do want the steak over the chicken for dinner. 
* Using covert contracts: childhood, not entirely sure, I think I used the if Im good, Ill get love and affection reasoning and wont feel abandoned. As an adult I use them all the time, if Im the perfect partner Ill get the love, affection and sex I want. I use them a lot, I try to be something of value to other people and in exchange Ill get their friendship or whatever. Im trying to just be more authentically me, and great if they like it but its ok if they dont too except that secretly its not ok they dont like it, I want them all to like me. 
* Controlling and manipulating: as a child I have vague memories of needing something to be sad about, I couldnt just be sad and ask for affection, I needed a reason. Not sure if that really goes in this category, as an adult I fill the same way. I need to have a reason for wanting or feeling anything. 
* Caretakeing and pleasing: childhood, if I pleased my parents I get love. As an adult, if I take care of everything and pleased my partner, I would get love, affection, admiration, sex and kindness. 
* Withholding information: as a child I remember feeling a lot of shame and like I had to hide things to be accepted. As an adult I feel the same but to a lesser degree, I hide mistakes and perceived flaws. 
* Repress feelings: Childhood, anger, strong emotions were not ok, you just got over them on your own and then everybody pretended nothing had happened. As an adult, I repress a lot of emotions, anger, sadness, shame, sexuality, aggression, hurt, fear, love 
* Making sure other people dont have feelings: not sure in childhood. As an adult, I treated the emotions about an issue the same as the issue itself. I would say/think The situation is xyz and therefore your feelings are wrong. I am scared of other peoples emotions. 
* Avoiding problems and difficult situations: as a child I avoided competition because it make me nervous and I avoided trying at things in case I failed. Basically the same as an adult, I also avoid problems in relationships.",0

**Physical**

I have to make some diet changes due to blood pressure rising again. Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast. I've acquired shoulder pain from having to substitute barbells for dumbbells in OHP. I had moved to dumbbells due to an unrepaired shoulder separation 35 years ago. Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy.

**Mindset**

After working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various ""victim"" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long.

**Relationship**

Wife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU. I had been doing ok with constant daytime banter and ""gaming"", but had to restart and rebuild after my incident. I had to consciously up the comfort, touch and praise. By Sunday it seemed like things were back to normal. And I'm taking my meditation time and practice with a renewed diligence.",0

Week6: Finances

I have been aggressively tackling credit card debt since last year. Im forecasting to be free of credit card debt NLT the end of this year. My student loan, is a different monster, but not too unwieldly, and I expect to pay it off within the following year or so.  


I am using Dave Ramseys Snowball + Debt Avalanche Method on paying off debt.  


So, what can be done during these DoD and going forward?  
1. I have at least a year and half or more remaining (at my current take home pay + side income) for debt payoff.Stick with my plan. Any extra income goes into paying off debt. More importantly, do not accumulate more debt.  
2. Prep. Ive begun mentally planning for saving for a down payment for a house. According to DR, I should be paying off debt first, but Ive heard otherwise, from other reliable sources. Either way, Id like to be rid of credit card debt, first.  
3. Budget. As with a lot of my problems, making a plan and sticking to it is my weakness. The problem right now is not overspending, its not controlling and managing where and to what my money goes.  
4. Control. Self-control is key. My wife is on an allowance and I should also put myself on an allowance to be honest, in order to more effectively tackle my debt and save.  


Week 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily. Week 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat.  
Week 3: Hygiene, Hair, Etc. Developing healthier routines.  
Week 4: Style: Updating current style. Prepping for summer and fall.  
Week 5: Game: Actively gaming wife. Still have yet to purchase a book on game, but have been following PoNs advice on game. Need to game randos.

**Career/Work:**  
*From last week:Asking myself how my work/career can contribute to my mission. How can I position myself to come out ahead after the dust settles with this Covid-19 situation? What do I want to do? Where do I see myself in x years?*  


I have an idea of where and how I want to live. How can/should I plan my career around this?  
I want my career to supplement my lifestyle, not the other way around. I.E. I have to live in the city, because thats where my office is AND commuting team is more bearable.  
Id rather live in a location and house that I love, and have a job/business that compliments/works well with that.  


**This week:**

Ive been enjoying the time off doing necessary stuff around my apartment, getting ready for the upcoming summer. Prepping kids to sleep in their own room, study, and just going through the motions. It all feels like one big blur. I cant remember what the fuck I did last week. I havent been writing in my journal as I should. Im still a lazy faggot.  


I did fuck up my work out routine this past week, as it was my wifes birthday. I slept in, ate shit, and didnt work out as I shouldvebummer. I have very little discipline, still. My nutrition plan is okay at best, but I make too many exceptions in other areas. Ive realized that I dont have the self-control or discipline it takes, yet, to cut loose a little bit, then be back on the grind the next moment.  


So I really need to create environments, according to Atomic Habits, where I set myself up for success. Id love to hear from you guys on how you dealt with a lack of discipline or built more self-control.  
*Kids:*   
One area I am constantly failing in, is patience with my son. I love my boy, and I understand that if I dont unfuck myself I could inadvertently create a Nice Guy who hates his father. This upcoming off-period, I am going to actively focus on being patient and better with him.

4578,4579,"Brother tried to kill himself todayHey guys

My brother got into a massive argument with my parents accusing them of never giving a shit him and never listening to him about his mental health. 

Hes a real stubborn type, never will listen to anything new, left wing, blue pill kinda guy, in college, never had a job or a girlfriend. Sits inside all day and beats off and plays video games. 

I come downstairs because of all the yelling, and see him banging his head against the wall just screaming telling my parents to leave him the fuck alone, my dad trying to grab him to stop him from banging his head, while my mom tells my dad to just let him run his course, and that if he truly wants to kill himself we wouldnt be able to stop him 

He storms out, steals my bike, so I try to go follow him, but cant catch up. I get my parents to call the cops, so they can find him before he tries anything. They find him over the edge of a bridge, and get him down. Hes in the hospital right now. 

I was never close with him, or any of my family. What do I do moving forward? Hes so stubborn, so if he doesnt end up killing himself, idk how Ill get him to turn his life around, which I think is the root of his problems. 

Hes very convicted, and I think because of his depression and low serotonin, he reacts to any attempt to help him change with extreme hostility. 

Any advice on how to move forward? How to help him? Or at least keep my family from falling apart?",0
4579,4580,"hang out with him more. dont try to redpill him, that never works out well in person. if you lift, get him to start lifting with you (assuming he doesnt lift). the gains in both appearance and strength should do at least something. help him find a job, or at least a purpose. help him set goals.",0

All I've learnt to do is listen and try let them get every thought out of their head. (only if you got a strong mind at the time)

These psychotic episode phases happen to a lot of men and in my experience they can last up to \~5 years. (after which most dudes become placid enough)

So given that he could be like this for a long time, you will need to learn to live with it and continue on your own path.

As for your own individual coping, some mates might give you good consolation but most probably won't.

Yeah he might start lifting, for a while. He might be able to feel better, for a while. He might get laid a lot, for a while.

You know shit is wrong, just talk to him and have a bro to bro man to man conversation, and no matter what is said make sure he knows you're on his side. Parents are really estranged from younger people now a days, they have no idea how to connect with them or what's going on in their minds.",0

4588,4589,"Size of status differential for career womenThis is a throwaway but I had a question for women who are also in high status careers or who are making substantial salaries


How does one make a man feel like a hero or that he is needed if, well, you dont really need him (in the traditional sense)? I am not masculine or alpha or aggressive at all, but I have had relationships break down because I didnt make my partners feel needed. Both of my two big breakups were with men in respectable, but not high-powered, careers whod been excited about me because I had a real job. Both breakups happened because they said they felt like I did not need them, and I am trying to figure out if it was due to something that I did wrong or if egos had played a role. If I need to play down aspects of myself or if Id just been with very insecure people. 


I do not brag about my schooling or my job or anything like that EVER. It is a lesson that has been voiced to me by many of my female mentors and I am well aware that men do not care much about womens accomplishments, Ivy League pedigree, or professional prowess. If anything, I downplay my career (currently a resident) and background. But the fact of the matter is that I have always worked hard, gone to top schools, and stayed on track. I am not a hardened, un-feminine career woman but I am simply driven by what I do (specialty derm) and am good at it. And I feel like I am being penalized for having high income potential on top of it all. After my most recent ex found out that I would be averaging $500k in a few years, he started picking fights and always making me out to be the villain, and I know Im not imagining it. It ultimately ended with the explanation of you dont need me, youll find someone better and leave. Maybe he was letting me down easy but I myself know that I am attractive. My work ethic translates to my physical upkeep, and I have improved my looks since we began dating, if anything.


I know that a lot of it has to do with him not feeling like a hero, but I really did try to make sure he felt needed. Its just that I dont really need any saving. I want a partner, and it seems like that is too much to ask. Has anyone else been in this situation?",0
4589,4590,[removed],0
4590,4591,This isn't advice. RPW are here to learn to rise above basic instinct. This isn't advice and I don't see participation from you on the men's subs so you do not belong here.,0
4591,4592,"In today's economy there almost always needs to be two incomes to get a house going. Men will always be a bit emasculated if you make more no matter what you do. That doesnt mean you need to back off your job of healing people. Medicine is such a rewarding career and one women are good at! We are natural healers and caretakers after all! 

Anyway, the right man will love you because of how well you channel that innate ability. As to making him feel needed, love and support him in his journey, value his decisions, and tell him you love him, how happy he makes you, and the joy his brings to your life. 

Men are simple in that regard. They want to feel like they're contributing and that they're loved. Show him that he is by making his day easier. Maybe have a carafe of coffee waiting in the morning when you get up for residency. Little things like that.",0
4592,4593,"What if you dated other doctors, or men in high-paying fields? They dont necessarily have to make exactly the same salary as you, but be in comparably challenging, high-powered jobs. Surely they would be more comfortable with your outlook and lifestyle.",0
4593,4594,"How did you view your intellect compared to those you were in a relationship with? 

Im only a nurse, but we still make good income, and for a few months I was making more than my partner. Now, were making about the same. But, my partner recognized the feminine skills that are involved with a caregiving field, and while I know I have a strong intellect, I admire and look up to him so much. For his ideas, leadership, perspective, Im almost always asking his advice or opinion instead of feeling the need to give him advice. I think these things lessened his insecurity regarding the pay difference, and I always make sure he feels like the man of the house. Id definitely up-play the feminine traits that make you good at your job, and find partners you deeply admire and respect. You cant fake that. 

Honestly, men intimidated enough by income to leave are probably not secure enough in the value they bring to the table as men. I do need my man, not for financial reasons but for 1000 other reasons. Find someone who sees that. 

Have you dated other doctors?",0
4594,4595,"I dated a very successful woman and it was enjoyable. I also have male friends that would/have reacted the same way as you have described.

What worked for my relationship with the successful woman, is there was a sense of balance. Although she made more money than me. She'd ""allow"" (for lack of a better word) me to pay for things. I once had planned a trip for her birthday. I had bought tickets to a show and surprised her, but I hadn't purchased the plane tickets yet. We talked about it and decided she would pay for airfare and I would pay for the events, lodging, and majority of food. The trip was lovely.

Throughout the relationship we had made a deal. Whoever has the idea, pays. For example if she wants to go to breakfast, she pays. If I mention us going to a movie, I pay. Things like that. 

Although it isn't all about money. She also ""let"" me be dominant in the bedroom. It is important that men feel like we can be men. When a woman tries to stifle that or if we feel unable to provide. We end up lost.

There are many ways other than financial to provide for someone. The men you dated may have been intimidated/insecure of your success. But did you allow them to be men in other situations?

It's often small things. Letting us drive places, build things, take over in the bedroom, make decisions on what we do, etc. Even if you paid for majority of the things, we (men) need to feel some sense of control somewhere in the relationship. If you drive everywhere, if we always take your car, if you pay all the bills, buy all the food. It makes us feel unnecessary.",0
4595,4596,[deleted],0
4596,4597,"Are you referring to starfishing? When I was saying dominant in the bedroom. I was meaning more like ""leading"". Like in dancing, allowing the man to take the lead. I maybe should've clarified.

She wouldn't just lay there, she would definitely participate, but I would take initiatives on which positions we did (most of the time, not all). I would ramp things up first or remove clothing first. Small things that made me feel some control. These weren't how all of our bedroom experiences went, but many of them.",0
4597,4598,"Basically, those men are losers. 

Woman does not need man and man does not need woman. People are in relationships because they want each other. People in relationships lean on each other when needed for emotional support and sometimes financial support - there is not set predefined need that must exist to keep people together. 

These guys were insecure because they did not hold economic power over you to keep you stuck if you wanted to leave. Women often overcompensate and diminish themselves to essentially baby these emotionally week men into feeling important because they do not have their own self esteem to keep them afloat.

All you need is a guy with self esteem. He could be a plumber, a cashier, a manager at a McDonalds or he could be a doctor or lawyer. Guys with low self esteem come from all income levels and guys with high self esteem also exist across the board.",0

4623,4624,"Ask Fwbs if she's going cold/okay? Is this needy?Have been seeing my female FWBs for the last 6 months.  She initiated the whole thing. 

Back in Feb/March she started to tell me she was getting attached.  Towards the end of March she seemed to open a lot more and her feelings become quite clear - she was really really into me.  We were also having sex everyday at this point 

Since lockdown, we've barely been able to see each other (we do have a little bit of freedom), perhaps once a week.  The last couple of weeks she has started to go a bit cold - definitely less flirty, less emotional etc. by text, although she will message me first everyday.  Things started to go south when last week she said she couldn't come round but offered to see me on the weekend to which I said we'll have to see.  Anyway, we met on Saturday and had a good time.  I then asked her on Monday if she was free to meet but she said she couldn't.  I asked her again last night, she initially said no but then later she hinted at seeing me but I didn't pick up on the hint so we didn't. 

I want to ask her how she's feeling - I'm wondering if she's going a bit cold because she thought I was rejecting her or going cold towards her myself?  Is this a weak move to ask her? It feels  like I'm asking her where I stand?  There is something definitely up with her though but no evidence as such to back this up.  She used to message me a lot during work but that has slowed down, as with messaging in the evening - it's all a bit dry. 

I like her and want to keep this going but want to avoid coming across as clingy and needy.  On the one hand, it's like she's falling in love and she's trying to play it cool to not get her feelings hurt - but the on other, I can't tell if she's pulling back because she's getting bored - however, she will still message me first most days.  

Does anyone have any advice here?

4633,4634,What is the line between being a girlfriend and being a wife?Part of using the red pill dating strategy is to marry someone who values you as the woman you are and to keep that marriage healthy and happy. Something I've noticed though is women acting like a wife when they are only a girlfriend which only gives a man more reason not to marry. What do you think is the difference between being a girlfriend and being a wife is? What behaviors should a wife do but not a girlfriend as to not give too much to a man who hasnt fully committed to her yet? I am sure there are many different answers for different women even within this community. As someone who is a girlfriend and not quite a wife Im interested in what you ladies think.,0
4634,4635,"Some women are married but never act as a wife (sometimes not even as a girlfriend). Same thing with men. It's not about marriage it's about the intensity of commitment between the two people.

Whatever the situation, if you're truly commited towards each other you're his women and he's your man.",0
4635,4636,"Gf- cooks on special dates
Wife- organises most meals (depending on how chores are split) and shares grocery/meal prep plans with their partner.

Gf- helps pick out a sofa or curtains by making suggestions or comes along for the shopping trip 
Wife- equal vote on interior design. Empathises with partners preferences they come to a compromise 

Gf- does laundry as a sweet gesture
Wife- has a laundry schedule that fits the partnership 

Gf- splits meals, he sometimes pays, no financial commitment to each other 
Wife- comingled finances and a long term financial plan

Just a few examples. Hope this helps.",0
4636,4637,"The problem with this is that a lot of what you've mentioned as 'wife' behaviour would also be the behaviour of a live-in girlfriend. Once people are cohabitating, things like laundry and groceries and cleaning and interior design become both of your responsibilities.",0

Dont create a fantasy relationship or play house where are acting wife-y because it is entertaining but you are paying zero attention to his reactions or contributions.

For me, I wouldn't buy a house, share significant finances, or have children with someone to whom I am not married. I probably also wouldn't provide too much input on major life decisions - eg if a boyfriend wanted to move cities or change jobs or have a medical procedure, my input would be much more general and impersonal than it would be with someone to whom I was married. Conversely, I would not sacrifice too much of myself for a boyfriend. I'd never quit a job for a boyfriend, or quit school. Especially if you're making economic sacrifices (eg quitting work to be a stay-at-home partner), I'd caution you against doing that with someone who's not your spouse.",0

He leads me in the Faith- he had a proven track record *before* I met him.

Before I met him; My husband he was active in ministry in his previous church. Once that church had dispensed he has committed to attending another church weekly. He has always given faithfully to the church and has supported various missions. He is also sponsoring a child.

After I met him; His commitments did not change. Since before we were engaged he brought me along to his church and introduced me to his church family. He has supported me in supporting the missions I am involved in financially and also agreed with my request for us to contribute more to the church. He has continued sponsoring a child (which he did not advertise to me, but I noticed when I saw a letter from world vision).

Now we are married; We attend church weekly together. Every night in bed he reads his bible next to me before we sleep. He also has a YouTube channel where he creates sermon jams. 

He has never over promised or broken a promise.

The first time I met my husband he kissed me on the cheek and opened the car door for me, the door swung back and closed, but by that time he was half way around the car. He cringed hard and tried to brush it off. 

From that first meeting forward he always opened my car door when coming to pick me up and closed it behind me. I would always giggle and insist he never had to do that and it was ridiculous to keep up, but on this occasion and on many he said Ill never do anything for you that I cant keep up. And it was true. 

He never over promised, he never over extended, he never spoilt me to woo me in the beginning then became tight later on. His spending, his actions towards me and his love for me never spiked then fell. He opened up the car door for me until we got married and started living together, so I open up my car door now (partly on my insistence, haha). After becoming ill and battling chronic illness, he started opening the door for me again when I was too weak. This is a small example of how he has stayed consistent.

He doesnt lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences.

I always used to joke with my husband why dont you just lie to me?! I dont want to know!  When he told me things I did not want to hear. I was joking, partly, as my sinfulness wanted an easy life and a man that told me what I wanted.

Well, through Gods grace to me, Im married to a man that is so honest to me, sometimes it is confrontational. He doesnt like above the knee jean shorts, he thinks theyre hideous. He doesnt like t-shirt dresses, he thinks theyre equally hideous (two things I wore often), he doesnt like long skirts on me, he doesnt like short hair etc...etc... it might sound picky, but its directional and in going against what hes said, that would be the true confrontation. It is unloving to do something you know your partner does not like.

My husband spoke to me and suggested we go shopping. He encouraged me to dress like some of the girls my age and that how they dress would suit me a lot (can you imagine hearing this without a humble heart?) but he has never brought something up without his support and means to fix the issue. So, he takes me shopping. Wow, look at my hot fianc! (We were engaged at the time) it made me feel admired and loved, it was amazing to see his reaction and how happy he was every time I skipped out to his car wearing the clothes he bought me. In saying that, we didnt buy anything I wasnt comfortable in, a few pairs of jeans, white sneakers, multiple t shirts of the same colour- so simple but he loved it, and I loved him even more for telling me. Ive bought many husband approved dresses since, which he adores.


He has clear standards for me. He introduced me to his friends, family and church. 

In his vetting process of me, he let me have his real personality from the beginning. He made things clear how he liked it and as we interacted with other couples, we saw real life examples of how we would and wouldnt want to be like. 

Couple A- My husband is friends with the husband. He cant stand the wife. Shes overweight, unkind and screams at her husband in public. My hubby was very clear at his distain for her and never pretended to like her even in front of her. He was blunt and didnt go out of his way to acknowledge her. It was clear he did not respect her. I never wanted that to be me.

Couple B- My husband did ministry for a long time with the husband of this couple. His wife was sweet, feminine and absolutely lovely. She was kind and warm to me when I was an outsider in the group. She was respectful of her husband and it showed in everything they did together. She was thin and dressed well. My husband enjoyed our time a lot with this couple and told me how much he respected their relationship. He would say things like theyre the real deal I think its amazing shes kept in shape so well after having a child 

By this feedback, and seeing how he treated these different types of people, and on top of that, knowing how consistent he is as a person, I knew how not to act. 

His health/ my health 

He has made it clear that cooking at home needs to be healthy. My husband goes to the gym 5-6 days a week and eats the same thing for lunch everyday. I would push him sometimes for him to let me prepare him lunch, but he insistent that is what he will eat everyday and it is what is best for his health. 

We go shopping together and buy the food I will cook together. I buy ingredients he likes and ingredients that are healthy. He has told me he wants veggies in his diet, so thats what I cook. He wants high protein meals, so thats what I cook. I make sure I have the ingredients for all the meals he could want (to a point) so he has the freedom to ask for what he wants for dinner.  

He has made what he wants clear. He does not allow us to eat take away more than once a week. He is hyper aware of his body (I always catch him tensing in front of the mirror, haha) and is hyper aware of my body. Hes made it clear he does not want me to gain any weight and that the weight I am right now is the largest he would like me (Im 58kg, 54) he has also found the most hilarious way to let me know Im gaining weight  wow honey, look how big your breasts are! Makes me laugh thinking about it. With his help, Ive stayed pretty much the same weight since meeting him. Him being honest about his absolute disgust for fat people has helped- and its a mutual thing. I wouldnt ever let him gain weight and I have his support back.


He takes care of me and brings me security 

Financial security; My husband sought to get a stable job and savings before he put himself on the market to be married. By the time I met him, he had a deposit saved for a house and a job that was recession proof. He made it clear to me that is getting a house together would require me working full time until we were ready for kids. He told me it would be difficult and that he would support me in this. 

God provided me a job that is close to home and my husband drives me every morning. (Currently not working due to COVID)

Health; during our engagement I had a trip to the ER. It turned out I had a cyst on my ovary, we did not realise the health hurdles we would be tackling in the next year and a half because of it. 5 more trips to the ER, specialist and doctors appointments, IUD insertions and a surgery later, Im still on the mend and take pain killers to manage in the meantime. This is a chronic condition called endometriosis. I never, ever expected my husband to be so supportive and unconditionally loyal. 

I remember on one trip to the hospital I was passing out in the passengers seat and vomiting. In my moments of consciousness I looked to my husband and he kept saying dont worry baby, we are almost there, its going to be ok.

I trusted him and let the anxiety go. Its a blurr but I ended up in a hospital bed getting emergency pain relief. He waited with me in the hospital the entire day. This happened quiet a few more times. After my operation I went back to the ER and we waited in the horrible waiting room chairs for 8 hours through the early hours of the morning. Everytime I looked at him I wanted to cry out of gratitude, I felt so horrid and he was right there with me. I can not believe the level of empathy and maturity he has shown to me when I was in 10/10 pain.

In my moments of absolute weakness and exhaustion, so much so I couldnt cry out to God, he would put his hand on me and pray for me.

He puts me first before his family.

We come from a traditional culture where the mothers tend to baby their sons. I love my MIL to death and I dont mind her asking questions, but my husband without hesitation always shuts everyone down if they question how I am at home. 

Does Anna cook for you everyday? He will respond along the lines of why does it matter? She can do as she likes shes the cook of the home. 

Oh, poor Anna, she cant speak our language he will respond what do you mean poor Anna? Shes a lion. You should be the one learning English.

He will shut down any conversation that is not kind to me, he does not complain about me to his family nor friends. He will not let his friends joke about our sex life.

He does not let me overextend myself for the sake of his family even though I am extremely willing to. He tells me and has the strong belief that our immediate family unit (him and me) are most important and everything else is secondary. We of course love his family a lot, especially his parents, but hes made it clear we wont partake in anything just for the sake of tradition. 

Bonus points:

-He gets along amazingly with my Dad, we all hang out all the time and its the best part of my life! 

-His family love me (they joke constantly they love me more than they love him!)
 
-He is good with children and loves his nephews, we even baby set sometimes.

-He grew his beard for me.",0

I worked two jobs and the only luxury item I owned was my purse and my phone. He didn't judge me for being poor. He appreciated that I knew what it took to survive on my own.

Strengthening yourself in these areas will help prepare you for real problems and avoid the ""dellusion"" that many beautiful women find themselves in during their 20s before waking up to a nightmare in their 30s when the constant attention stops being thrown at them.

4688,4689,"The 80/20 concept is inherently flawed, based on data that doesn't represent the population, and selectively ignores parts of that data that make men look bad.I'm a guy. I like a lot of what TRP has to offer. It helped put words to things I had felt and experienced for a long time. But it's very clear that certain pieces of TRP wisdom have spent far too long in the echo chamber and become dogmatized and mythologized beyond all rational sense as a result.

The 80/20 concept is a prime example of this. I often see it referred to as the 80/20 ""rule,"" and see guys use it to show that 20% of all men are Chads running a harem.

The 80/20 rule is, so far as I can tell, based of a combination of a misappropriated Pareto principle and some very selective data pulled from [Tinder](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) and [OkCupid](https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/).

The most glaring issue with treating 80/20 as a rule for romantic interaction generally is that the data isn't based on the general population - it's based on data extracted from two very specific dating sites. The best you can say is that it applies on Tinder and OkCupid. That does not therefore mean it applies to the general population. A small percentage of the population use these apps. They are a product. They attract a certain kind of person, often for a specific purpose. Tinder dynamics =/= dating dynamics.

The Tinder study is so flawed it's hardly worth looking at. It's based off the self-reported data of 27 women. 27. Millions of women on the app, and only 27 were interviewed. So beyond not being representative of the general population, that study isn't even representative of Tinder.

The OkCupid data is a bit more solid. What does it show? Well there are a few things to note:

Yes, it appears women on OkCupid are pretty brutal in regards to how they rate the attractiveness of males. 80% of men on OkCupid were rated as below ""medium"" attractiveness. But again, this isn't an analysis of dating in general - this is an analysis of how women on OkCupid rate men on OkCupid. It's possible that women on OkCupid are just pickier about looks compared to the general population. It's possible men on OkCupid are just uglier than the general population. It's possible they just aren't good at dressing, grooming, and taking good profile pictures (and having looked over the shoulder of female friends as they swiped, I can confirm there's a lot of dudes who probably look pretty decent but absolutely suck as presenting themselves well). 20% of men were rated as above average. I've often seen this ""study"" used to confirm that 20% of men ""get"" 80% of the women. That's nonsense. And here's why:

What TRP conveniently omits from this analysis is that while the women were pretty brutal in terms of who they rated as physically attractive, women also largely went on to initiate contact with that same block of men they just rated as physically below average. Look at the graph. In terms of who women are actually willing to pursue they basically the opposite of picky in regards to looks. Arguably this is evidence that women are *not* particularly shallow - they have high standards when it comes to looks, but other things in a guys profile - humor, career, charisma, hobbies - prompt them to contact these men.

What about guys (*on OkCupid)*? Well we're much more fair about attractiveness ratings. It's a nice bell curve peaking right around ""medium,"" although I have to imagine the thought process here went something like ""mm... boobs... hot..."" But who do guys (*on OkCupid)* contact? That same study that ""proves"" 80/20 found that two thirds of all male attention is focused on the top one third of women. So why isn't there a 66/33 rule? Well because that would make men look like shallow horndogs drooling after only the hottest of the hottest women who are way out of their league and then complaining when they strike out. It would make men look bad. So TRP ignores it, rather than codifying it as a rule for all human interaction the same way they did with the data on women. Well that's not quite correct - they only did this with the data that makes women look bad. The part that shows that women happily initiate contact with far more than just the top 20% conveniently gets omitted from this ""rule.""

Finally, just on a common sense level, one fifth of all men are not Chads. Think of any time you've seen a pretty random subset of the population, have *one in five* of the men present been jacked, jawlined, charismatic pussy-slayers? No. Not even close. Probably more like 1-2%. And do these men get a lot of sex? Yes. Do they probably get sex from the hottest women? Yes. Does this mean there's no sex available for everyone else? Not even close. A majority of men report having multiple sexual partners over the course of their lives - the 0-1 category is a minority and, considering that many religious people who weren't trying to get laid before marriage are in the 1 category, it's probably even smaller. Only between 12-14 percent of adults aged 20-24 have never had sex. This number drops to around five percent for adults aged 25-29, and by age 44, only around 0.3 percent of adults report never having sex. So if your goal is to be able to effortlessly hook up with different hotties five times a week, yeah, sorry, you're shit out of luck. That's only something Chad (or a very very rich guy) gets to do. But you don't need to be a Chad or in the top 20% of men looks-wise to have a normal, happy, healthy sex life, or even to get laid quite a bit.

4727,4728,"How to be Alpha AND likeable?Hey guys. Since becoming more alpha Ive actually lost friends rather than gained them. I get girls more easily but men seem to be threatened by me and theyre passive aggresive/purposely leaving me out of events etc. Also new men I meet who are physically more beta/dont workout are passive aggressive toward me even when I am nice to them and dont compete with them. Sometimes this happens with other jacked men too. 

Just before lockdown started, I went to a bar with friends and was hooking up with a friend of a friends gf. We were all there together and I started getting attention from some other girls. Another woman (few years older) tried to hit it off with me in front of everyone and I played it cool and she left for a bit. I didnt initiate anything. Then I went to the toilet and she followed me. My friend clocked it and came to grab me.. he told her to piss off and was angry with me. He said I was supposed to be dating his gfs friend and I wasnt strong enough with the other woman but I could tell he was just jealous that I got attention and he didnt. He was punching me in the ribs calling me stupid but to me it was a translation for Im angry that you got so much attention and I cant get that

Now Im a nice guy. Even when I know other men cant compete with me I dont rub it in their face because honor and respect. And getting girls isnt the goal of my life. I actually want real bros. It just pisses me off that they cant see that and by being nice I get treated like shit its weird. I didnt do anything wrong with this woman. I got attention that I didnt look for.

So my question is how do you be Chad AND likeable at the same time? My friends joke that I look like a fuckboy which means they subconsciously think I look like I fuck a lot of women but they only put a negative spin on it because they cant do the same. They have left me out of the pack so many times as if Im some dishonourable guy who chooses hoes over bros but I never do.

My female friend whos a PHD biologist (a very logical female whos honest about hypergamy) told me that Im a threat to 90% of men. Also at the bar my friends gf told me when she was drunk that Im really handsome and every girl at the bar probably wants to fuck me. My friend didnt hear and neither did the girl I was dating. (Her friend)

So what am I doing wrong and how do I become more likeable? It seems that men dont respect me for whatever reason. Are betas more liked by everyone because theyre softer and more agreeable? I mean Im never an asshole to people but Im always strong in my convictions and never lie. I thought this would command respect from other people but it doesnt seem to. Hmm or maybe thats not it. Its just I have this one friend who everyone loves but hes not alpha at all. Hes adopted the new age mantra and is all about positive vibes etc. Im not like that as Im a realist, but Im not an asshole either. So I dont get it.

A hard lesson you will learn when you become successful, with girls or money or career or whatever, is that success breeds terrible envy and deep-seated jealousy.


Betas are not more likeable, they are more compliant. Mushy turds if you will.

4737,4738,"Do you think breasts are inherently sexual?Sorry if this sounds a bit scattered, I'm just writing a stream-of-consciousness about my thoughts on this right now. This question has been haunting me for many years. I remember this one time I was at the beach when I was young and I was watching the boys around me wearing just their swim trunks and how free it must feel not to have to wear a top, and I felt this sort of painful longing. I felt sad that girls just couldn't do that, because boobs are ""inappropriate"".

Now that I'm older, I have many more thoughts about this. I still feel the painful longing I felt when I was younger whenever I see men just being allowed to have their shirts off and not have to cover their nipples. And I just wonder, why is it that boobs are seen to be nearly as sexual, if not *just* as sexual, as genitalia? There is really no difference between male nipples and female nipples except for the female breast's function to breastfeed, which requires more fatty tissue.

My theory on this is that women's bodies are just so objectified and oversexualized in every way that even body parts that seem biologically and inherently sexual really *aren't*. Rather, everyone in (at least western) societies have become socialized to cater to the male gaze, which views women through a lens that hyper-sexualizes women for male benefits. I do not think that female breasts are inherently sexual; rather, our response to viewing breasts in a purely sexual way is a result of being trained over and over and over that breasts are for men's sexual viewing pleasure. We have sexualized women's breasts so much that women cannot even breastfeed their children in public, a normal biological need, without being hyper-sexualized and condemned.

Theoretically, I think it is possible for women's breasts to be seen as just as nonsexual as men's are. It will take many, many years of deconstructing the male gaze and removing men from the position of the ""default"" human being (thereby removing marginalization), but I think it can happen. For the most part, I believe we have a choice of which body parts we choose to sexualize or not sexualize (besides *maybe* genitalia). For instance, biologically, cis straight women overwhelmingly prefer men with larger shoulder to hip ratios, but you do not see men's shoulders being covered up and hypersexualized. I do not think that is because men's shoulders are actually ""less sexy"" than women's breasts; rather, I believe it is because most societies have been designed for men, with men being the ""viewers"" and women being the ones who are viewed. And so, men's preferences and decisions on what is ""sexy"" or not have taken precedence and are thought of as being universal, while women's desires and what body parts they view as sexy on men are mostly silenced or not recognized to be as sexy as any body part women possess, because women are, as we have been trained, inherently sexual, while men are not.

In general, sexualizing women's nipples while not sexualizing men's nipples creates an imbalance where women are taught to be inherently ashamed of the body they possess because it is automatically ""sexual"", while men are taught that their body is the normal, default body that is allowed to view women as objects for their sexual viewing pleasure.

Whoops, this was a lot longer than I meant it to be. But I'm curious, what are your thoughts on this?

**TLDR:** I believe women's breasts are over-sexualized because we have been socialized to view women through a male gaze which believes women's bodies to be inherently sexual. This, in turn, sexualizes body parts that are not actually sexual. I think it is theoretically possible to desexualize women's breasts in time, when men are no longer deemed to be the ""default"" human and society is not designed solely for men's benefits and desires.

**Edit:** I also want to add that I am bisexual and nonbinary (AFAB). While I find women's boobs to be sexually attractive, I do not think of boobs *only* in that way and I do not think of women as being inherently sexual objects because of their bodies. I would have no problem living in a world where women can walk around with their tops off, because boobs are beautiful in ways that are more than just sexually, and so are women as a whole. I think boobs are a body part like any other, and they definitely can be sexy, but they are not aggressively inherently sexual and inappropriate like we have been ingrained with. Society has an undeniable problem with looking at women as parts rather than as people.",0

4836,4837,"How I succeeded in datingAfter reading a lot of hoopla on inner game, flirting and other BS that there is out there, I came to an undeniable conclusion that most of these were full of shit. Sure, you could learn something of value from there, but most of it BS. So, I started using my common sense and got success.

I started working out. Not just because I wanted to date hot girls, but because I wanted to improve my health. This after having a fatal hospitalisation due to liver swelling. I improved my diet, which was now balanced and vegetarian. I did eat boiled eggs for breakfast though. And, I started working out. Hired a trainer and started finally. There were many points in time where I simply wanted to run away from gym and sleep in my cozy bed. It was painful, but worth it in the end. Now, for a year I have not been sick. Not even a cold.

Secondly, I started visiting a good barber. I can't emphasise how important is having a good hair cut. After getting my haircut, I kept going to the same since it is important to go to the same barber for maintaining a good hairstyle. I have specs so I bought a stylish pair of eyewear.

Thirdly, I improved my fashion sense. I started taking my female friends for shopping my clothes. If you want to attract females, better ask them what suits you. Besides, they have a much better fashion sense than males.

Meanwhile, while executing all this, I started socialising. Like just going out there. Started chatting up any girls that I liked. Initially, I had nerves. I was frantic, nervous. But gradually I started gaining confidence. I read somewhere that when girls reject you, think of it as their loss instead of yours. Initially, I will be honest, I got depressed upon rejection. It shattered my confidence, but I kept at it. I had to. And eventually, this benefited me. I became desensitised to rejection. Whenever I got rejected, I got a bit sad but moved on. 

Then after some time, I finally got success. Hence my confidence increased. But a big part of it was me getting fit. I cannot emphasise the importance of what being fit did to my confidence. No longer had a pot belly. No longer was I skinny. So I would say this, going to gym and being fit will boost your confidence enormously. You do not need to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Just be fit. Muscular. Don't go overboard with it, lol.

Another thing that has kept me happy in the relationships is:-

* I do not dip my pen in crazy ink.
* No games. No push pull. Be genuinely busy. Develop constructive hobbies. Develop interests. Be an interesting person for the sake of living fullfiling life. Not to get chicks.
* Never pursued a girl that was playing games. I have my self respect intact. No girl is worth losing it. I have a rule about dating. If after first date, the girl does not herself ask for another date or start a conversation, I consider it to be the end of it. Never drive single handedly. After some time if a girl is not reciprocating, or is confused. I tell them to make up their mind.
* Be forth coming once you start dating about what you want. No pussyfooting about what you want. Do not be friends if you are attracted. You will end up suffering.
* Do not be manipulative. Do not put a nice guy act. Girls can see through it within seconds. They might end up using you and then dumping you before you get anything.
* Do not stalk. Do not be pathetic. No means no. Develop a thick skin and learn to move on.


tldr:- Use your common sense. You do not need a love guru or a dating guide or any other BS.",0
4837,4838,"Very good post, to the point and makes complete sense, It's a shame how many people still rely on manipulation and gimmicks to get girls. It's always better to be the best YOU instead of trying to be someone else.

4838,4839,"Short story

Redirected anger constructively. It killed my nervousness.

Long story

I had a guy friend tell me that the girl I was interested in was out of my league. I told to get lost, lol. Still approached the girl, she said the same to me, lol. I was enraged. 

Then an idea came to me. I approached her friend after some time lol. Told her she easily stood out in their group. She chuckled at this, and the first girl was very angry. It was a power move. I saw that anger destroyed my nervousness if I redirected it correctly.",0

As you can see the vast majority are men and they've seen some success in the courts to remedy their right to due process violations.  So much injustice has occurred for the sake of addressing sexual assault on campuses.  Unfortunately from reading a few cases these men still face an uphill battle in proving gender bias of these ""kangaroo courts"" in court, especially in instances where the committee convinces the accuser that he/she was sexually assaulted when he/she was unsure.",0

Sex should be something built on trust, honesty, intimacy and love. 

How can you create such an environment without telling her the truth? You cant't! If you tell her, it will create closeness and she will understand why you act inexperienced and she will be able to ""help"" you (e.g. show you how a certain position works) and answer all your questions ... and she will not expect the sex of an experienced guy ... 
You will enjoy the sex more if you don't have to hide your inside ...
Also, you will get used to really open up to your partner and that is the base of every really good relationship ... 

Maybe she will reject you, but rejection is a natural part of life and will always happen no matter what you do ...

But if you just want the superficial sex portrayed by our degenerate pop-culture, it does not matter what you do anyways - just go ahead and lose your ""virgin status"" ...

4916,4917,My architectural history professor did the exact same. Mankind was her example of words she deemed sexist.,0
4917,4918,"With such people making such remarks, it is always interesting to ask then why, if such words are so critically important that they denote sexism (which is so incredibly linguistically illiterate it's astounding), is their movement named after women, which clearly must also be a sign of sexism, and everything they fight against, from patriarchy to manspreading, manterupting and toxic masculinity, is named after men. Aren't such words also likely to be internalized harmfuly by young boys the way ""mankind"" is going to be internalized harmfuly by young girls?

Of course all of it is neglecting the fact that the ""man"" in mankind was the term representing a human being, and has to do with the hand (""main"" in French, same root as manual) at the time where male humans were referenced as ""wereman"" (like it is still in werewolf) and female humans were referenced as ""wyfman"".

It can be argued that the disparition of the ""were"" in front of man has more to do with the fact that men are only valued for what they do in society, hence their unique role being fused with the ""hand"", the ""man"" that is used to describe a profession (like in fireman, policeman).

To argue that the ""man"" in English word refer to men and is sexist is illiterate, and also (ironically since it is feminists we are talking about"" completely American-centric. It forgets that there ever was other languages than English, and that English has shared and borrowed words from all sorts of languages, including in large parts Latin and French. 

It is as incredibly stupid as ""we call it history because it is his story"", when in fact, it comes from historia in Latin (where ""his"" isn't a thing) and it is more likely that the word ""story"" actually comes from a deformation of ""history"" than the other way around.

&#x200B;

So just a funny story. Been going through some stuff lately with all this extra face time with my partner. For the last 11 years we have been in a battle of wits because ever since taking a few classes on human sexuality in college I came to the conclusion that ""I don't want to have sex with just one person for the rest of my life"" and ever since we have just been at odds, every argument devolving into ""well if you just want other women then go"" and I would swallow my pride and try and make things up as best I could. Don't really regret any of this but in retrospect I was just hurting myself my not just ""doing what I want"" and letting the chips fall where they may. I stifled my education, felt no motivation to acquire wealth or solidify friendships. It all kept coming back to this futility between what I want and what I am ""supposed"" to want. All I wanted was to do this in the ""best"" way for both of us, wanted to be as honest as possible, and wanted to ultimately fill our life with love and social connection. She wouldn't even accept that I wanted those things, It had to be about her vulnerability in life, and everything I was saying/doing was just a means to get away and marry some other girl.... And my play was to waste my entire 20's on this?!?

Fast forward to the vids-19 and I simply couldn't keep pretending like this wasn't ruining my life. Basically a ""I love you, but I now realize that if I don't do this for myself then I won't respect myself as a man, or even as a father, and I don't want to bring crippled life into this world."" Didn't even have to say ""I'm going do it or I'm going to leave"" or any truly shitty ultimatum, just simply ""I am going to be doing this, and I respect you're decision to do what you will with that information.

Boom. Instant ""I want you to be happy, I know you really care about me etc. etc. etc. we can make this work.""

Where was this the last 10 years when I was trying to compromise and do things without being a dick? Why is this here now?

So off we go, she tells me ""I'd like to be a part of this journey with you, if you're patient with me I WANT to come along."" Go on a dating app for ethical non mono's, find a beautiful woman (whose partner wasn't a total goob) who was keenly interested in dating. All lights are green, I'm communicating with both of them and we are jiving well, I'm feeling... Good.

I start exercising more, cut crap out of my diet. It was easy! I had reason! I WANTED to be attractive again. And it felt... Great. Like a literal cloud had lifted from my vision and I could taste the vigor and optimism I had in my early 20s before it was chipped away. I started answering calls, I ""forgot"" to smoke weed from sunrise to sunset. So many things in life just started falling back into place.

When the time comes and we start a group text, everyone is talking and jiving, but I realize that my partner has only said one thing, and it's starting to feel awkward all around. When I ask her if she is having a hard time opening up, or if there is a reason she doesn't feel comfortable participating in the conversation she says... her fingers hurt too much....

Your fingers hurt?!?!? I excuse myself for a moment to try and smooth over my bubbling anger and take the time to think of the words to express my frustration, less than 3 or 4 minutes literally just took a piss. I come back and she is sleeping on the couch.

I become livid, absolutely livid (I have also been having to deal with the unemployment office on a daily basis which is incompetent as hell so my patience as a whole is way less than usual.) I tell myself I am going to have a glass of wine... literally black out after the first few sips and wake up with half a 6 pack and a pack of cigarettes with 4 missing. I was devastated, I had worked so hard to quit smoking, and had gotten my drinking under control years ago and I allowed myself to be crushed by petty squabble.

Long story short every micro step of the way she was sabotaging me, changing the rules of engagement. Generally running diversion as a means of delaying the inevitable.

Fast forward to today. In general we do our best to keep our good time ""good."" So we decide to pack a lunch and take a short 5 or so mile hike through the woods and have great conversation about our family, life goals, what we would want for our children. Just general good stuff that you look for in a good relationship. Get home, and try and tactfully inquire about some sexy time. She says something along the lines of ""its hard for me to feel sexy when your talking to other women."" so I take that for what it is, wait a while and eventually just rub one out. Not a huge deal, I've been taking care of myself for years now.

Some time later she comes up as I'm working on some Spanish lessons, asks me if I emailed her the recipe for this pizza dough I've been working on for the last 3 weeks (she knows I already did, she had it pulled up on her phone and I could see it!) I tell her that I'm pretty sure it's in her hand right now, she asks if I want to help her make it... Nah not what I'm ""wanting"" right now. She tells me she doesn't know how to use the kitchen scale... So I go and show her and carry on about my day.

Comes back up as I'm finishing my last lesson and asks, again, if I ""want"" to go pick up some cheese from the store for her... You know what, sure, I could use the air and stroll and I do love you after all.

I pop into the store, and grab 2 things instinctively. The cheese, and her favorite flowers.

As I'm walking back up the driveway the heavy shit hits... If I'm buying her these flowers because I want sex I'm just fucking myself over. I'm literally rewarding her for playing hard to get and trying to stifle my upward momentum. And out of my mouth with glee, almost as if they weren't my own words I say. ""Theses are my flowers!""

I come in hand her the cheese with flowers in hand. She is beaming, eyes welling up. ""Why did you get me flowers?"" I tell her I didn't, and that I got them because I just wanted them. I ask her, ""where do we keep the vases again?"" Plop that vase right in my officer and carry on with my day.

She literally won't stop BEGGING to give me sexual attention. But I'm good just wanked!

This is CRAZY. But it doesn't feel anymore crazy than what I was doing before placating her every-move.

Any tips to not ride this train off a cliff? I feel like I can still feel this way, and be sweet and loving and romantic, but right now I'm getting more positive attention being an asshole. I never wanted to believe that the whole ""assholes"" get girls thing was even real in any sense. Can I just like convey this to her somehow or am I best off maxing out on this new found mentality.

4941,4942,"How to move on and let go?Basically I'm asking for advice on how to move on and let go of this girl who has been tormenting me in my own head. She lived next door and we quickly became friends  as we had a lot in common. At the time I was very bad with girls and had no experience. I quickly developed a crush on her but had no idea to make a move. She would often flirt with me when drunk but I was oblivious and shy at the time. Fast forward I grew some balls and started talking to girls and getting with women. This led to me and her eventually hooking up. However she quickly started displaying weird behavior. She would flirt with me all night and then leave with another guy, was constantly hot and cold I thought I was buggin but her friends agreed that this was a habit of hers. I became upset with her and my neediness caused her to end things but I found out that she had lied to me about something else and ended our friendship. She begged me for forgiveness and so I forgave her.

The year after we start hooking up again but one night while we're walking home she ditches me and sleeps with my best friend who had a gf. He knew I liked and even bragged about lying to her and how bad she wanted him to me and other friends. Im beyond upset and tormented. Firstly that she would sleep with a guy like that, I usually couldn't care who she sleeps with, not that she even needs my permission but it just makes it ten times worse to think that she would sleep with a guy like that. (fast forward he did something similar to another friend months later but they were actually about to date the girl.) . Obviously this is more of a me problem why does it bother me so much that she'd sleep with a guy like this. I mean I'd understand like if the guy was actually charming but he wasn't good looking, was narcissistic and a compulsive liar. When I asked her about it she said she was really drunk and him as well, which checks out. But idk if she was drunk enough that she didn't know what she was doing.

An important part of this story is we never had sex we would always get close but she always claimed she'd feel bad bc her best friend had a huge crush on me and told her not to. Which was true. I think this made it all the more worse as he got something so easily that I had been trying so hard for. But she also had a string of toxic behavior that made me question if this was the real reasoning or if she was just manipulating me, for validation.(I could never tell although she did seem sincere when she said she did want to sleep with me). 

Logically I know this girl and friend aren't for me and I should move on from both but their both stuck in my head, its been many months now and time isn't helping. I constantly think about the two of them together. And for some strange reason I still want her, no girl has come close. I've had sex with a few more girls since but nothing is filling the gap. I want her out of my head

Anecdata time, to illustrate the issues I see with this sort of surveys (also, the article supports their claims based on data from surveys for the most part, while at the same time linking to a paper that criticizes data from surveys as being misleading...)

Since the COVID-19 thing started, I've been confined with my parents at their house, and my father is still working (fortunately he can do so with his computer), so he wakes up at 7am in the morning and takes the dogs for a walk (if possible) while I prepare breakfast for the two of us (my mother usually wakes up at 9am the earliest). He also takes care of buying and/or preparing the firewood to keep the house warm (not needed as much since 1-2 weeks ago, and I too do my part in this, but you get the idea), keeps the garden in a good state, and fixes most if not all things related to electronics or informatics in the house (so the computers and associated software that allow the three of us to still work from home, the air conditioner...).

He's also responsible for the maintenance for both of their cars, buying the food (and medicines, sanitizers... Everything that needs buying, he is responsible to get, basically) and storing it in the fridge(s) in an organized way, after the three of us decide what we'll be having for lunch/dinner the next 1-2 weeks (he then makes a plan to *when* we'll be having dish to keep the diet somewhat varied and avoid having to cook too much some days, and not at all others, and to avoid over-filling the fridges).

On the other hand, my mother keeps the inside of the house (but nothing else) clean and prepares lunch once every two days (my father does so the other day), while either any of them or I prepare dinner (depending on who is ""more available for the task"").

With the questions presented by the survey, if the article you linked is nything to go by, I would say that in this case my mother would end up being the one my mother would me most of the ""home-schooling"" (if there were any kids), even though my father would be helping a lot by taking work off her shoulders (the time he spends shopping, taking the dogs for a walk, and preparing/fixing all devices that allow the rest of us to do our work comfortably, is time saved up for the rest of us, including for my mother, who could spend it ""home-schooling""). In a similar way, the question:

> Who is currently most responsible for housework, such as cooking and cleaning?

Would be answered such that my father would be doing at the very least as much, if not more, of the housework, if you look only at the part before the colon. However, he technically does less than half of the cooking and cleaning, which may explain discrepancies in their answers.

So, basically, most of it comes down to how you ask the questions and how you present the results, in terms of the conclussions they extract. And it comes down to how each couple/family organizes themselves. I got tons of help from both of my parents when I was younger, and would find it insulting if anyone tried to minimize the work **both of them** did that allowed me to (for example) study at the university, be succesfull in getting a degree, then a master, and later on a PhD and a career. They each did their best and helped tons, in different ways, by talking about how to organize themselves, and playing their own roles within those plans.

This sort of surveys sometimes seem to be looking for specific answers, by looking at how the questions are formulated, and then these answers are usually extrapolated to cover much more than the questions allow to. Thus the way the reports are made, both in terms of the answers themselves and how they are interpreted.",0

Also, ""responsible for"" in this context is ambiguous and potentially subjective.

If I usually take out the trash, but only after my partner asks me to do so... who is ""responsible for"" the trash going out?

4979,4980,"Fwbs - Unsure if she's pulling back...confused on what to do?I'm unsure if she's consciously pulling back, she's lost interest, or she's just comfortable....but something has changed. 

I've been seeing my female colleague Fwbs for the last 6/7 months. She initiated the whole thing and we called each other our 'distractions'. 

Sex started out as once a week, which gradually increased overtime. In Feb, she told me we may have to stop as she's starting to feel attached. I think this was to gage my reaction and interest level.  Up until then, I held my emotions close to my chest and always let her bring up the flirtiness and 'emotions' first - she would often message saying she would like a cuddle or whatever and then apologise for ""needines"" saying as ""there's no place for it"".  I always reciprocated to the same level and energy. 

Then in March, I started to compliment her more and tell her how much she turned me on etc. At the start she told me she was very needy and insecure - and believe it or not, but these compliments and reassurances did wonders for our 'relationship' - we were having sex nearly everyday. We ended up staying a night in a hotel through work - the day after, she was telling me how much she liked it and that it made her feel like she wanted more. She then wrote me a long message about how attracted she was physically/sexually and started it off by saying ""some things are best left unsaid"" - I asked her but she refused to tell me. At this point, it was her doing most of the chasing - I was just sitting back and letting things happen. 

Then lockdown happened. We have a bit of freedom so can see each other occasionally. For the first few weeks, she would come over a couple times a week, however, I would always have to ask her (I've always done it, I think she feels too vulnerable in making plans for sex) as she would never invite herself round. She was still being flirty by message, saying she wished she had more time etc. to come round. 

Then, 3 weeks ago, I asked her round and she said she couldnt but ""would honestly love to see me. Maybe tomorrow?"". I said ""yes, providing you can get here by xx as my roommate will be in"". She replied ""I will see. You can always meet me for one of your walks on the weekend"". I said ""my roommate normally comes with me so we'll have to see"". She then had a slight outburst and said ""you told me you normally walk alone, good to know I won't have to go out my way"". I replied ""he does on the weekend but not in the week"". Anyway, she said that was ""nice we do that"" and then messaging continued in a normal chit chatty vibe.  I will admit, I did tell her I walked alone everynight a few days before and I only said my roommate comes with me on the weekend to lash out in response to her saying no - she's always so flakey and I felt like she asked me about 'going for a walk' as I didn't reciprocate her saying ""she would love to see me"".  

From that point however, she has taken a lot of emotion and flirtiness out of her messages. We've met 3 times since, once for sex and I can still feel her physical attraction is strong. But her messages have been quite dry. I will also say that she does continue to message me first everyday (always, always messages me first) until we say goodnight, but it's mainly chit chat and about work stuff. She seems to deflect any flirtiness and doesn't initiate any emotions anymore. 

I like her a lot and want more but it's difficult as we work in a very small team, and neither of us wants to be rejected. 

I just find it odd that up until the whole walking conversation, she told me a few days prior that she was missing me, and that seeing me once a week wasn't nearly enough. Then a few days after the convo, we met up and she said to me ""little every so often is nice though, at least it's something"". I mean, seriously? 

Another interesting point, is that nearly a week prior to the walking convo, we had sex and she messaged afterwards. It seemed like she was 'teeing' me up to be emotional towards her first but I didn't. Nothing obvious but my gut told me by her messages that what she was doing. And when I didn't, it's like she tried to play it cool after. 

I want to ask her if she's okay but it's been a while and I wanted to see if she would come around and be more open but she hasn't. I also don't want to ask her as it will make her feel vulnerable and she will likely deny it anyway. I'm also cautious that perhaps I've overpursued her and she's losing interest and backing off slowly. 

Is it best to just play it cool, give her space and let her come to me more, or just tell her ""I think I upset you?"". I wonder if she's slowing things down to keep her emotions in check - perhaps she realised we were getting carried away? I just don't want to blow it by coming across as needy and seeking validation when there's nothing concrete to present back to her...",0

>Feminists dont agree on every point regarding gender disparities. Pasquerella, for example, is not troubled by the lopsided overrepresentation of women in nursing, she said, because there is no evidence men face stigma or discrimination in that field.

I find that hard to believe. I mean, it's anecdotal to be sure, but I have friends and relatives that have gone through nursing programs, and this wasn't their experience at all. It was actually akin to the worst stories that you hear about women in other courses. 

> A paper she co-authored for publication this year -- Choice of Majors: Are Women Really Different From Men? -- reports that girls respond to a variety of influences and are more likely than boys to change majors when they get poor grades in STEM classes. Ironically, female-only programs may diminish their interest and confidence.

Truth is, this is a culture that I think really stands out of if you look at it, and there might be something there there, in certain STEM courses. ""C's get degrees"". ""What do you call a doctor that barely passed their tests. Doctor"" and so on. 

I actually think there's something to be explored here, and that this might be where there's a very real socialization gap. The problem is it's not sexy to talk about. Girls and Women tend to place a higher intrinsic value on grades. And then changing it....again, not something we're comfortable talking about. 

My position is clear...I believe that these barriers exist far less in different environments. It's why I encourage things like commuter schools and online learning. If discrimination is a problem...IMO these are the things we can best do to directly address it. But that stuff is probably off the table.

But I think this sort of results-driven hammering? I don't think it's sustainable, for that very reason. It's too self-contradictory. Unless we're going to straight up say OK, things are going to be draconian until we get to statistical equality, deal with it....but even then, honestly, that's just going to create fights over who gets to be the target of said draconian measures. Who gets set on fire to keep other people warm?",0
5014,5015,"Part of the problem here is I dont think we will ever achieve statistical equality with those in power currently there.

The problem is that there is a lot of people in the field of gender equality which are only and exclusively advocates for women.

You can see how begrudging some of these schools were to allow men (into programs named for girls) simply so they could continue their agenda.

The problem is the mindset and goal is wrong. We cant even evaluate statistical inequality without looking at other things such as women making up 60 percent of degrees in masters programs. Just to point out how big that difference is and there is no school addressing it.

Also, I agree that STEM gives out harsher grades and there might be some difference either social or biological that causes that to affect women more. It could be because of inflated grades given for other subjects or if one sex is used to failiure more often that they perform better when failiure is a higher risk. However, we cant get to that conversation because people are trying to balance out percentages, but only ones they feel are discriminatory or that affect women.

These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly.",0
5015,5016,"> Part of the problem here is I dont think we will ever achieve statistical equality with those in power currently there.

Yeah...that's probably a big part of the issue. Especially when those in power game up with said out-of-date theories, and have a vested interest in maintaining them. 

>These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly.

I used the wrong word for draconian. I didn't mean harsh per se...I meant one sided. What I meant was we're just going to say, all these programs are just going to be help women. Full stop. They do not apply to men. Just put all the cards on the table. 

The problem is that's not politically viable, I think. It just breaks a basic sense of fairness that I do think is dominant still. As well...I think it just makes the costs too evident. It's not some vague goal...it becomes...yeah...your son has to sacrifice to get the numbers right. Sorry, he has to give up on his dreams. I'm sure you'll make him understand that it's for the greater good. 

I think that's why it's not sustainable. That's the other side of the pendulum. We're stuck between a relatively vague commitment to ""equality"", which won't last under scrutiny at a systems/process level, and this other point of not wanting to be thrown under the bus/throw our loved ones under the bus, for the greater good of equality.",0
5016,5017,"So, is the solution to allow sex-based groups so long as the excluded gender is allowed to start their own group if they like, or to make all sex-based groups illegal and all groups/schoalrships/University class must be 50/50?",0

Under Title IX, there has to be equal programs with equal funding by the university for all sex exclusive clubs, programs, activities.


Its not enough that the university just allow one to be created. If they find it, it has to have matched funding. Same with promotion.

Welcome to football massive revenue and rules meant to prevent schools from spending all their money on stadiums for football teams while not even having a volleyball area for this.


To me the solution is not about equal numbers at all. However thats the rationale behind STEM programs so its useful to criticize other percentages based on that.

Optimally to me equality of oppurtunity would open doors to stem fields without closing any on anybody.....which includes men wanting to learn STEM in a greater proportion then women as is their choice.

The problem is that I find their partial solution draconian and they find my solution discriminatory because there is disproportionate interest. This all comes from us having different views on biology of men and women.",0

>Optimally to me equality of oppurtunity would open doors to stem fields without closing any on anybody

But class sized are finite. You can't have hundreds or thousands in a single class, so there needs to be some measure of who gets in. That seems to be the complicated part- deciding on and agreeing on those metrics.

Is your position that if a school buys the mens team $5000 worth of basketball uniforms, they have to also buy $5000 worth of basketball uniforms for the womens team as well, or give them $5000 to spend as they like?",0
5019,5020,"Sure but realize how much money was raised by football teams that they could hire coaches and pay them 10 mil and still have 150 million left a year....

Mens basketball is also typically a revenue generator. Would it be fair to have the mens team get advertised and have new uniforms and get TV deals when the womens team could not facilitate any of those?

Enter Title IX, school now has to provide similar offerings for mens and womens teams. 

I guess what I am trying to say is if what you said was the standard of fair then we have decades of discrimination against male athletes. Men got the short end of the deal for a long time but now that the shoe is on the other foot and men would get the benefit of this legislation, now it is suddenly a problem!

Equality cannot be redistributive only when you want to when Title IX is a redistributive piece of legislation that it is based on.

If we did sports scholarships by demand/popularity, we would see more male scholarships. Would that be fair?

5020,5021,">If you disagree with Title IX, then do you disagree with its redisbrutive effects on men over time as being unfair or unequal?

I don't understand the inner workings of Title IX or the American University culture enough to definitively say either way. That's why I'm on record repeatedly saying tit for tat is an absurd approach. Either people decide they want utter equality (sports teams getting the exact same amount regardless of the revenue they generate, or you allow funding to be based on need, popularity, merit, personal interest, and then you have times when men or women don't get what the other group does. 

Either we want firm and absolute equality even when it's silly, over-reaching and imo, dystopian, or we learn to live in a world where the 
give and take of all resources is flexible.",0
5021,5022,"I agree with you but let me lay out the problem as I see it:

The problem is popular advocacy wants the best of both of these worlds frequently. 

Oh this is a situation where men are outperforming without involvement? Lets redistribute the success! Equality of outcome!

Oh this is a situation where women are outperforming men? Well hands off! Freedom to choose! Freedom of association etc! 

The issue I have is when you are here defending things with freedom of choice and another person defends stuff with equality of outcome . Sometimes both are used by people who only care about womens interest and they either dont understand or act maliciously about how its discriminatory against men.

I would select equality of oppurtunity by the way. I am actually against Title IX existing, but that means I would want everything it affects including sports to be undone. I would like everything judged by that same standard.

The problem is we have lots of areas where we have redistributive policies which benefit women and areas where women have more rights and/or outperform that should arguably be distributed.

Some examples of redistributive equality policies that benefit women or tend to benefit more women: quotas, child support, Alimony, sports payment/scholarships, marriage/divorce laws, female only programs, gym hours.

Some examples where women have an arguably better deal out of it without any other intervening policy: child custody, paternity laws, womens scholarships, draft, #believewomen, dating, power of sex appeal, FGM/MGM, spending gap

You can also list some redistributed policies that favor men (bathroom lines based on same size bathrooms in public)

You can also add non redistributed policies that people argue should be redistributed (Pay Gap, job career choices gap)



I could add more things to all 4 of these areas. The point is that it is common to see freedom of choice arguements made alongside redistributive ones. (See advocacy for my body my choice and compare it to wage gap). However I look at all these issues and notice that redistributive equality and equality of oppurtunity get men shafted on both ends of it currently, frequently. 

I see current advocacy as using both standards, combined. This is no longer equality but a way to use equality as an arguement of convenience to argue for something above equality.

So, when I argue Title IX, its not because I believe Title IX is the best thing ever, but because I am pointing out the lopsided tendency of advocacy that argues BOTH Outcome and Oppurtunity...picking whichever arguement is convient.

The goal should be to pick one standard and work towards it. Instead we have the bastardization or arguing as advocacy for women by any standard that can possibly be used to support the arguement.

This is why I consider my flair to be the most important thing for advocacy in general. I am not anti woman or pro man.. I am advocating for a consistent standard.",0

Hint: don't use teeth. Participate in sex, don't just lay there and moan as necessary until he goes. Also, don't fake orgasms. He will think he's doing it right so he'll keep doing it which will lead to sexual frustration. Most men like a little life? from their partner. If you're not enjoying it, they're most likely not enjoying it. 

Generally? Also, a cold beer (or his favorite beverage) and 15 minutes of silence when he comes home from work. It sounds antiquated but my guy loves this part. He works about an hour commute from home so he's stressed from work and then a crazy long drive. I try to have a cold beer or drink for him on his desk when he gets home and just 15 minutes of peace and quiet to decompress. I just let him do his thing. ""Hi babe! How was your day?"" ""it was xxxxx"" and then I leave it at that. He'll come to me when he's chilled out a bit.

Most importantly ASK HIM WHAT HE LIKES. You're not a mind reader. What seduces guy a might not seduce guy b. Just ask what he likes. If you want to make him happy, ask what makes him happy.",0

Others just say well youre really attractive so why not? And none of these benefit me in any way? They just think I must be begging for it after a year??

I've noticed this myself - a huge number of people here (and in other self-improvement/dating communities) struggle with taking that first step and actually starting to work on themselves and fix their issues. It's easy to read everything on here, buy seduction books/courses, read 100 websites, watch other people hit on girls, feeling that rush of dopamine as you excitedly think, ""It's not that hard - I could do it too!"" But it's another thing to actually *do it yourself*. **Taking that first step is the hardest step you'll ever take.**

Other guys feel like it's too late for them, or that they're ""far too fucked-up"" to ever have any hope of getting laid or finding a girlfriend or being in a happy relationship. They'll lurk on here (maybe even comment every now and then), reading everything that's posted, but they'll never in a billion years even consider for a second that they could be out there making progress themselves. They gave up hope years ago; after all, getting laid is something that's reserved for *other people*.

I want to share my story, to show you no matter how much of a handicap you're starting with, no matter how screwed up your life or your mindset or your head may be - you can turn it all around. It won't be easy. It'll take a shitload of work - probably years. But it's very bloody doable.

**I'll give the short version of my story:**

I was extremely suicidal from age 14 to 23. As in, every single day Id have fantasies of killing myself. I lost count of the number of times I found myself in the kitchen holding a knife to my wrist, willing myself to have the courage to *finally fucking do it*.

I was in 2 abusive relationships, had ZERO friends, and my life consisted of nothing that really made me happy. I didn't think any women would ever truly like me (my girlfriend at the time hated me, it was a pretty fucked up relationship - we just yelled and screamed at each other all the time). I had a job for a bit but I lost it, and that was when things *really* got bad.

That job was really the only thing getting me out of the house, and once I no longer had it, I turned to alcohol. I became a raging alcoholic (was drunk basically 24/7), developed a severe porn addiction  (most days watching 8hrs of porn) and spent the rest of the time playing video games. I developed really bad agoraphobia (fear of leaving the house) - I literally couldn't go outside to check the mail. I'd make excuses not to even go to the grocery store - I'd make my girlfriend buy all our groceries, which only made her hate me more.

I hated my life, and I hated *myself* even more. I had no friends, no confidence, no reason for existing, nothing that made me smile. My family lived 5000km away so I didn't even have them. I was obviously depressed as hell about it all - like I said, I used to fantasise about the knives in the kitchen draw, or I'd be crossing the road and I'd see a truck coming and I'd think, ""If I just closed my eyes and stood here right now, it could all be over.""

Worst of all I was completely hopeless - I was convinced there was **no way** I could ever change. I was stuck in this miserable existence and I'd always be unhappy. I told myself when I hit my 30th birthday, I was allowed to kill myself.

Eventually I hit rock bottom when my girlfriend broke up with me, and my family found out how depressed/suicidal I'd been. I had to confess everything - the addictions, the alcoholism, the agoraphobia, the suicidal thoughts, how much I hated living.

My parents were so fucking supportive - I moved back home to live with them for a year. They forced me to go see a counsellor, and forced me to start leaving the house. It was absolute *hell* at first, but I slowly got better at just being outside, then making friends, then working on my addictions. I lost weight (75lbs in total), started hitting the gym and lifting weights (went from not being able to do a single pushup/pullup/squat, to being able to deadlift 175kg). I found self-improvement websites and started getting my mind right, worked on actually *liking* myself, and started building a life I could be proud of.

The last thing I had to fix was my dating life - and that was honestly the hardest thing ever. I went through an ""approach anxiety program"" (google ""Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program"" - it's free) and that was absolute HELL. You end up talking to 1500+ girls over the 6 weeks. But, by the end of it, I was confident enough to actually hit on girls properly and try to have sex with them (even though I was still terrified and shaking most of the time), and I actually started getting laid. I went on OkCupid/POF/Tinder/etc as well, and over time got really good at getting laid on there too.

I've met some fucking *amazing* women over the years since then, including my current girlfriend of 2 years. She's the sweetest, coolest girl I've met - she adds a *hell* of a lot to my life. She's also bisexual so we've had a bunch of 3somes with other girls (about 12 from memory). Good fun.

I never in a billion years thought I'd actually have any women truly *like* me for who I am - let alone have sex with me - let alone have 3somes and wild sex adventures a girlfriend who adores me. That stuff seemed so impossibly out-of-reach for me all those years ago; like a pipe dream I dare not even contemplate.

Most importantly of all, I'm really fucking **happy** with my life. I haven't had a suicidal thought in years, I haven't been depressed in years - every fucking day feels like I've been given a gift and I'm so bloody grateful for it.

And [proof I get laid now](https://killyourinnerloser.com/proof/) (including pics/vids/stories).

I hate the idea that anyone is sitting on here thinking they're a *lost cause*, that it's too late for them, that they're too far gone, that they'll never be able to change. I hate the idea anyone feels like their struggles are insurmountable. Trust me when I say this: **I am nothing special**.

It doesn't take willpower (in fact, I have [very little discipline or willpower](https://killyourinnerloser.com/andy-discipline-willpower)). You just have to start working on your goals a little at a time - aim to just take *one tiny little baby step forward* every single day. Those tiny little steps add up over time, and before you know it, you'll be a long way ahead of where you started.

If you're unhappy with your appearance - start losing fat/hit the gym. All you have to do is sign up for a gym membership, or go Google ""how to lose weight"". **That's one baby step you can take right now.**

If you don't know how to talk to girls, go google ""Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program"". Just google it and read a bit of it. **That's one baby step you can take right now.**

If you have no idea where to meet women, sign up for Tinder and just start talking to girls. I have a huge (free) Tinder guide on my site that covers literally every step from improving your looks, to taking pics, to messaging girls, going on dates, having sex, and even keeping them around for months/years afterwards. Seriously, just install Tinder and just start getting used to how the app works (you don't even have to message any girls yet) - **that's one baby step you can take right now.**

If you're super depressed, google counsellors in your area. Or send a message to a mate, ""Hey man I gotta be honest, I've been feeling really bad lately."" Or send a text to a family member telling them you've been feeling down for a while. **That's one baby step you can take right now.**

No matter where you're at right now, there is always *something* you can do. Some tiny little baby step you can take **right now**\*.\* Stop reading, stop sitting around watching other people find success, and stop thinking you aren't worthy.

If I can do it, **you sure as hell can too.**

How long did it take to get your squat up? How tall are you? How old are you now?",0
5137,5138,"I'm 32. I started most of the self-improvement stuff when I was about 24 until probably 26. Then I had a couple years where I was kinda just in ""cruise-control"" and a bit lazy. When I was 28 I started working on getting laid and hitting the gym.

Took probably 2-3 years of hitting the gym (I'm naturally incredibly weak). I'm 6ft2 (In my experience the only reason people ask me my height is so they can say, ""Well I'm not that tall, so it's easy for him - therefore, I don't have to try."" Read [this](https://killyourinnerloser.com/youre-so-lucky/), then read [this](https://killyourinnerloser.com/i-cant-get-laid/#i-cant-get-laid-because-im-shortim-not-tall).)

\-Andy",0
5138,5139,"Hahah, guess i'll be prospecting 29 before I get to squat powers.

I started losing weight when I was 16. Had anorexia at 18 ish and lost all my quadricep gains. Been doing calisthenics since but I have naturally low muscle tone so I've been hitting the gym as much as I can manage on a daily basis (which is not much)

Idk about asking height. It feels crushing to know that i'll always be in the lowest percentile for height and have to work exponentially as hard to make up for it. That alone gives me depression sometimes, i guess i haven't worked up enough grit yet.

Rn i'm on chicken breast and greens, lol. Trying to control carbs and stay consistent. I dropped 1kg in the last week and am getting used to tasteless chicken breast after 2 years of it so i think I'm getting somewhere",0
5139,5140,"Yeah, if you're shorter you're definitely working with a handicap - but we all have handicaps. Mine was all the stuff I wrote above. You'll have to work harder, no doubt - but that doesn't mean you can't get laid.

I do a bit of life coaching sometimes - two of my coaching clients are shorter dudes - one is 5'7, one 5'6. One was a virgin in his 30's when he first started seeing me; he's since gotten laid about 5 times now (over the course of a year). He absolutely had to work harder than a tall guy like me - and that's exactly what he did. No reason you can't do the same (even if you have to work fucking hard to get there - that'll just make your victory even more meaningful).

Oh fuck man, that chicken breast and greens diet. I did that for a while but it killed me lol. If it drives you too insane and you can't stick to it - try other diets. A bunch of them work for weight loss (keto works best for me now, but I lost the \~75lbs by eating whatever the hell I wanted and just sticking to 1500 calories - that's called ""IIFYM dieting"").

Gym - you seeing a trainer or a coach? I can't say that I ""earned"" my gym gains (I mean obviously I did the work) - 95% of the credit goes to my weightlifting coach though. I'm a lazy bastard so I literally just pay him to force me to workout - there's no way in hell I would have gotten strong without him. So many days I've said ""I don't really want to work out today, Dave. Can you yell at me and make me do it?"" and that's exactly what he does.

Not saying a coach/trainer is mandatory - but they really do help if you've got some spare money.

5144,5145,"Feminist Stance on Sex Robots / Robosexuality?Throwaway Account because I feel more comfortable this way.

So we've experienced some pretty rapid evolution in robotics technology the past few years, to the point where sex robots are slowly becoming a reality, rather than just a bi-product of science-fiction.

Being a robosexual myself, I've always wondered:

What is the general consensus about sex robots or the attraction to robots in general in feminism? I've barely found articles discussing those topics in depth, let alone feminist ones.

Feel free to ask for clarification if needed.

&#x200B;

EDIT: A question's been asked as to how one distinguishes robosexuality from objectophilia.

It's cerainly a good question, so it's not gonna be that easy to answer.

I can't speak for all robosexuals, but in the robosexual community I frequent the most, they generally enjoy the reveal of a human actually being a robot. Think of Terminator-like reveals where there is damage to the skin, showing that the person you thought you knew actually just a near-perfect replica of a human, designed to either blend in with or serve humanity.

I've also heard the claims that a big part of robosexuality is objectification, specifically of women. While there's a sub-group in the robosexual community that enjoys the idea of being turned into a machine designed for sexual contact., consent plays a big part for most of these types of robosexuals. They want to be turned into a machine. (There's also a sub-group that enjoys forceful conversion of people into robots; I personally don't enjoy that, but who am I to kink-shame.)

**A big part for many robosexuals isn't the objectification of the feminine/masculine, it's the feminization/masculinization of objects. Giving life to the impersonal of the modern era.**

&#x200B;

EDIT2: Many people mentioned consent, so I'll add a footnote here. Most people (there's always bad eggs trying to force people to roleplay or whatever, they are swiftly banned) in the robosexual community value consent highly. It's one of the big parts about the fetish even. **We don't find that robots just don't provide consent, it's more that robots always consent** because their sex-drive is infinite. At least until they run out of battery.",0
5145,5146,Theyre a sex object. They shouldnt look too human to give the impression its ok to objectify people.,0
5146,5147,"People are capable of enjoying simulations without it warping their minds.

Are you of the opinion that videogames that involve violence should deliberately hinder their graphics to make the characters seem less human lest it gives the impression it's ok to commit violence against people? Or should violent videogames simply not exist?",0
5147,5148,"I personally dont play those games with very human looking characters and real looking deaths because I really get effected by killing in them - I dont get aggressive, just disgusted. 

But thats a different subject. Theres a general understanding that killing is not ok. The same isnt true for objectifying women. Its already done in our society and I dont need another tool to do so",0
5148,5149,"Would you rather these guys form romantic, loving bond with their sex robots before having sex with them?

As for the actual ethics I think thats one hell of a thorny issue, primarily because theyll continue to get more human as the technology gets better. Is that a good thing? Probably not. I agree that its not going to make the problem of objectification any better. But as for whether it WILL happen? Have you ever met a human being? Once that cats outta the bag itll be impossible to put back in. The whole conundrum will need hella rules to keep it from becoming a nightmare.

In it a man described stumbling upon on evidence that his LTR had cheated on him ruthlessly a couple years back. So what did he do? He dropped her instantly. Good move on his part. 

While I don't advocate snooping around emails and social media to dig up possible dirt I will say he did the right thing by confronting her and kicking her to the curb. 

However in his post someone dropped a comment titled ""Be like Pete"" and I clicked it. It took me to an archived post from 2016 on the Relationships sub in which a woman had posted that she got dumped for suggesting to her then BF that she was going to visit in an Ex in another country. 

[Read the post for yourself](https://archive.is/uULD2).. 

**Lessons learned:**  

\-Have abundance Mentality: Pete gave no fucks. He knew he could find another chick and didn't care about spending the last 6 months with her. It's easy to drop a girl for bad behavior if you have an abundance mindset aka the confidence in knowing you can easily find more woman. A beta in scarcity mindset would convince himself to keep a bad woman around for fear of being alone.

\-Never keep a woman in your life who would even suggest visiting an Ex. It's a huge red flag but she also tried to spin it on him saying he was abusive for not thinking she should do it.  

\-Men don't want to be friends with good looking women. She honestly thought her ex was just platonic and yet the moment she told him she got dumped he said ""great now we can bang."" (Paraphrasing that)

http://archive.is/lv4aW

>Summary: OP (girlfriend) gets asked by an ""ancient ex"" to meet up in Amsterdam for a week while he is there for work (he lives in Italy and she in the UK). She books the ticket before mentioning anything to her BF because:
they were on sale for a ridiculously low price on the dates that he would be there, so I jumped at the opportunity.

>Boyfriend breaks up with her without loosing frame and even 'that' subreddit calls her out for being wrong.

>Body: So they've dated for 6 months and she thinks that going alone to Amsterdam to meet up with an ""ex from ancient history who is more like a best-friend"" is a good idea. She starts with the excuses even in the title.

>Her boyfriend shows exactly how a situation like this are to be handled, no harsh words, no complaining about not going simply holding frame:

>Pete seemed cool with it at first but after a few days asked me if there was any history between us. I was honest and told him there was. He didn't seem too bothered and eventually asked if I thought visiting an ex in another country was appropriate whilst in a relationship. I explained to him how Dave and my relationship wasn't like that and that we were strictly platonic. He didn't seem to really react, he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic, I suppose, would be the best way to describe it.

>Edit: ""he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic"" -> ""dont need to talk, just grin"" (c) Endorsed TRP-philosophy.

>First he calmly suspects that this is more than platonic and asks her and her hamster believes that going a week to Amsterdam with an ex to do drugs and partying is a sign of a ""platonic friendship"" and feels safe confessing that he is actually an ex. He then proceeds to ask if she think its appropriate (not telling her its not, just vetting to see if she is really LTR material).
She then pulls out the ""strong independent black woman"" card as a response:

>I then told him that I wouldn't be controlled and hated men that thought they owned me and could tell me what to do. I told him I was free to see who I wanted and that I found his lack of trust in me upsetting, disrespectful and, perhaps, a sign of future abusiveness. I now realise that this may have been a bad thing to say. Again, he didn't really react so I thought that was the end of it.

>Here most men would have caved, given her reasons not go, told her not to go or even worse, supported the idea of the trip because nobody wants to be an ""abusive boyfriend"". Her boyfriend on the other hand shows exactly how to hold frame he even explains it to her:

>Then, last night, he came around to my flat and broke up with me! I asked him why and tried to get him to explain himself and he told me that my going away was to see ""another man"" a deal-breaker, that he'd been in this type of situation before and wasn't going to go through it again. I asked him if this was an ultimatum - I hate ultimatums, they are tools of abusers - and he said ""No, its not an ultimatum. I've decided to break up with you. I have not presented you with any options. I just came to say goodbye."" Before I could say or do anything more, he kissed me on the forehead, said goodbye and walked away. He didn't seem angry, just...sad.

Here comes some bonus:

>To make matters worse, I told Dave about what happened and he replied ""Oh well, guess that means we can have even more fun then! ;o)"" He didn't care about my relationship and my pain - he just wanted a hookup buddy and someone to get stoned with whilst he was in Amsterdam.
Suprise, her ex-boyfriend didnt invite her to Amsterdam to party to have a platonic friendship re-kindle. 

>Obviously both men in this story knew exactly what was up but she comes to the Internet asking for advice of what went wrong.

>I tried calling Pete today, about an hour ago, and he actually answered! He told me that I should look to be with someone who wasn't so abusive. He said, ""Please stop calling me - this is over. Have a nice trip to Amsterdam"" Then he BLOCKED me! How could he do that to someone he loves? Is he over reacting or was I? What should I do now? Was I wrong?

>""How could he do that to someone he loves?"" she asks herself without any self-reflection (until even the Internet told her that yes, you were wrong).

>Lessons learnt:
>Women believe in their hamsters, they are not lying when they say they ""didnt cheat"" or ""it just happened"", just because she believes her own lies dont mean you have to.

5234,5235,"A Man's Worst EnemyDiscussed in greater detail on my [daily video.](https://youtu.be/n7msLY3sEjQ)

There lurks an enemy in the soul of every man. So insidious is the enemy that many cannot even see it or know it.  

It is the difference between a rich man and a poor man. A CEO and an underling. A 'has' and a 'has not'. Someone who learns from those who have paved a successful path and someone who complains that they can't be successful and gives excuses.  

That enemy of man is Instant Gratification.  

**Examples include:** 

\-Eating a sugary treat when you know you should eat healthy 

\-Hitting the snooze button instead of jumping out of bed and working out 

\-Going out with friends instead of studying finishing that project or studying for that exam 

\-Taking out a high interest loan and eventually shelling out way more money for it instead of saving for it and paying with cash 

\-Playing video games instead of building out a business or brand or any other passion that could actually make you money 

\-Looking at porn and shooting your mojo into a tissue instead of letting it build up and guiding you into starting new relationships

In the end, all of these things come down to you being addicted to dopamine. Your body will supply you with dopamine when you do any of the above and there are many more examples than what I just listed.  

So what is the answer to fighting this? Well that should be obvious.  

The ally in this fight is Delayed Gratification. But how do we get in contact with this ally?  

You can throw away your video games and your drugs if you need to. It's an extreme method of control, but if you are constantly succumbing to instant gratification it is something to consider.  

One of my favorite ways to do that is this:  

Get in touch with your 'future-self' and ask yourself now what you wish you had done as your 'past-self.'  

For example... where do you want to be in 20 years? Perhaps a nice house on some big land. 3 cars. Maybe some kids. Maybe not. But do you really want to be living in your parents basement or with roommates? What is your 50 year old self going to say to your 25 year old self? Let me tell you this... as a 34 year old man I curse my 21 year old self. I had ample opportunity to be in the military.. to study hard.. to lift weights earlier.. to be much more successful earlier on. But no, I pissed my early and mid 20s away with video games, marijuana and porn. Yes I still bedded women but for what? My success today is largely based on choices I made in my 30s. My 50 year old self has desires and I cannot let that future man down.  

Do not let your future-self down! 

**Lessons Learned:**

All the choices we make today shape our future. If you can truly delay gratification you are setting your self up for a much brighter and successful life. If you are constantly giving into your desires for a quick dopamine hit your future will be less than it could have been.",0

In thet sub , thousands of men took part in disgusting actions such as doxxing and sharing pictures of girls from Instagram on that sub without their consent, and on top of that discussing about how they would f**k them and making deteriorating comments about their bodies and such. After a few days of them being exposed and confronted , someone posted about a group of girls doing the same, Now , I am not saying that girls doing it is justified or anything but why not speak about this before? Why only speak about this when you've been confronted? Why are people taking this like a competition? Also, the post about the girl's group and the comments on that post were things like ""now feminists will"" ""where are the feminists now"" .

Those men issues are also very important, but if those men you describe reallly care about the problem, they will address it & try to solve it independently. Yet in my experience, men who bring up male rape victims as a dismissal of female rape victims are the ones who laugh at prison rape jokes & shame male victims as being weak. 

Feminists dont expect men to  lead the revolution for womens rights, so why do men (like the one described above) want feminists to lead the fight for mens rights? We can be allies for each others cause. This doesnt mean feminists dont advocate for men because we do; I make it a point to also address the inequality that men face. But I prioritize women issues & mainly address womens issues because I am a woman and it directly affects me.

I've always been a believer that being an ugly woman affects more than just your ability to form a romantic relationship with friendships coming in a close second.

Human beings as a whole just don't value you or respect your existence when you're ugly. Any 'friends' that I've had would exploit my insecurities  by either making fun of things I'm self conscious about, give back handed comments, or state ways in which they look better than me ect. They also just didn't value me as much as their other friends. I'd have to message first, always, or risk not hearing from them, ever. They were always curt and impatient towards me, as if I was a nuisance that should be thankful that they waste their time on me.

Because of this I realised a very long time ago that platonic relationships aren't worth my while. I'd love to have a friend but I've yet to find anyone that cares about me even slightly, even the people that seem to be nice to 'everyone'. 

As such I'm incredibly lonely which is further exemplified by the fact that I've had a lot of bad things happen to me over these past few days, and not even one person to talk to about it. It's soul crushing.",0

Anytime in the past that I've managed to befriend someone, they dump me for a newer, shinier model. And I'm just left to wallow in my own misery. It's painful, and I go through the motions of thinking what did I do wrong, why me etc. But that doesn't help and to be honest, they were never very good friends anyway.

I still feel a pang of sadness at times, and there's only so much isolation one can take before you descend into madness, but I can't deal with the bullshit anymore.

It's nice, but once you see how much friendlier people are to you when they assume you're decent-looking you can never go back... Still worth it, IMO. 

Unfortunately, as you've probably realised, it's pretty much impossible to find genuine friends when you're trying. (Decent-looking people don't need to try, so never realise this LOL.) Best thing to do is try and improve your alone time, and dose yourself with bits of social contact (family, internet, etc.) for basic survival. 

If you're seriously desperate for some one-off social contact, talking about random shit in the Omegle spy question mode kept me above water for a long time. You just have to go through a lot of bots.

I really dont understand it. Maybe the Elder scrolls series is just so good that they dont mind. Any piece of media that contains a woman or minority needs to be twice as good as the average one without them in order for it not to be called propaganda.",0

The elder scrolls may borrow historically accurate settings (each race being a historical race/empire) but they do such a good job of blending those historical connections into an original lore that you lose any grounds for historical accuracy. As for women in the game, the series touches on slavery, criminal rights, racism, war crimes, nationalism, classism etc. but it rarely talks about women's liberation.

5310,5311,"Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, such as sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.

The meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.",0

5346,5347,"Your identity catches up to your actions and vice versa.We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore our habits shape and create our lives and our identity. Our identity does the same in reverse.  

When you decide upon improving yourself, whether you start by eating healthier, working out, cold showers...
you should aim for attaining an identity of someone who eats healthy, who works out, who takes cold showers, not necessarily the act itself.

This is so because, our ego is our biggest factor of motivation for keeping or developing habits. If you perceive yourself in a certain way, you will subconsciously strive to do what makes you remain that way, which is why breaking bad habits is so hard. You are comprised of them (good or bad) 

Most important thing to keep in mind is to have patience and not get discouraged by not seeing immediate results. If you workout once, twice and so on you have to keep doing it until your identity catches up to your actions. When your identity catches up and you are a person who works out on a regular basis no strings attached, then it becomes automatic and requires little to no willpower.

Also don't get dissapointed if you for example have developed a healthy habit of working out, but can't seem to do work/study consistently or whatever else. Each habit requires it's own growing and nurturing, but a carryover effect is real.  Make your life a rolling ball of compounding quality healthy habits and don't go in all at once, start small.",0

These people are required to go into work just to stamp documents.  Someone in that sub asked ""can't they bring the stamp home?"", which lead to the following response:  

>A question that only someone thats never lived in Japan would ask.

>There doesnt need to be any practical or logical reason for a rule

>Rules no matter how trivial are followed without question

>People actually go into a sort of shock if you violate a rule

>For example my wife once tried to order hot takeaway milk from a Mr Donuts.

>The server explained that you can takeaway coffee etc but not hot milk because you might not drink it right away and it could go bad and then make you sick. Long nonsense discussion

>My wife proceeds to order a hot milk to eat there and asks for an empty takeaway cup. At this point we assumed the server knew what was going to happen next because she gave my wife the milk and the cup without question and there really was only one explanation for wanting the empty cup.

>When my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.

>The sort of rule breaking that my wife just did literally doesnt ever happen in Japan.


This absolutely blew my mind.

Apparently following rules is so burned into their culture, that they wouldn't even consider breaking even minor rules.  

Another comment in the same thread mentions how you can't even order an omelette without rice.  You have to order the omelette with rice, then throw the rice out while the server stares in disbelief .


>Then my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.


Which got me thinking about the blue pill ""rules"" here in north america in context to the red pill (get a gf, get married, get her pregnant, pay her cash and prizes when she's ready to move on, and don't you dare deviate from that path you fucking sonofabitch!).


I realized our ability to say ""fuck this I'm gonna spin plates, avoid marriage, enjoy the decline, etc"" results in the same ""ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah short-circuiting in blue pill programmed individuals.

.


""Seducter, you can't fuck her, she's married!  ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah

.


Not only did I fuck her, but I sent her ass home to the husband who's cooking supper for her and the kids.


Just seeing that comment thread made me really appreciate the freedom that we have.  To be able to break free from society's conditioning and do what we want.  Imagine freezing up in a firestorm of cultural programming and indecisiveness because someone asked you if they could borrow your shovel.

5397,5398,"High n count and long term relationships. Red Pill truths confirmed by a plate.TL;DR: A plate of mine confirmed red pill truths about how her having a very high N count resulted in not a single meaningful long term relationship that she so wanted to have.

We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story.

This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). 

Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). 

At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint.

Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here).",1
5398,5399,"High n count and long term relationships. Red Pill truths confirmed by a plate.TL;DR: A plate of mine confirmed red pill truths about how her having a very high N count resulted in not a single meaningful long term relationship that she so wanted to have.

We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story.

This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). 

Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). 

At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint. This seemed to calm her down a bit and I let her spin the hamster to a conclusion that all is good. After which we got down to business. 

Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here).",1

5408,5409,"You're not a beta becoming an alpha. You're an alpha recovering from a fucking disease!Today I had a fucking epiphany.

I've always thought of myself, deep down in my subconcious, as a beta. No matter what I was trying to do, I was a beta, because I was thinking so of myself.

I made some money... still a beta, cause why not? I somehow fucked some girls... still a beta, cause why not? Worked out, dieted, turned my body into a fucking anciet greek sculpture... still a beta in my mind, cause why not?

No matter what I did, I was a beta. No matter how better I got and how much I advanced, I was still a beta and I was to remain a beta, whatever great achievement I might've had.

**Because I was brainwashed into it!**

This my simple epiphany. We are brainwashed by the society to think very lowly of ourselves, the government wants us as manipulable as possible, so they instill these thoughts in us ever since we're kids.

We, as men, we naturally are alphas, thanks to our biology, thanks to our dick, balls and endocrine system and thanks to our anatomy, we're BUILT BY NATURE to conquer, or at least to relentlessly try to conquer as best as possible.

There's not one single motherfucker out there, who's a natural born beta, there isn't such a thing.

Think of it this way: you start out as an alpha by nature the moment you're born, and your anatomy is there to confirm it. Then, with each passing day, society, friends, family, the government, the massmedia, social media, start fucking with you, a little here, a little there while you're growing up, instilling certain retarded, against your nature thoughts in your brain, which don't benefit you, but benefits them, until you forget your true, masculine, animalistic, conquering nature, thus, you become a little puppet.

This is why you always feel an interior conflict, this is why usually you feel anxiety and depression. You KNOW who you are, deep down. You very well know what the fuck you feel like doing and saying, there's a little voice and instinct in your head that you feel like you should follow because it's gonna turn out good. But just before starting to follow that instinct, you start thinking... ""but what if he thinks I'm a weirdo cause I didn't laught at his joke? Better start fake laughing"", ""but what if she thinks that I'm not a good boy that she can trust, better not tell her how retarded she sounds"", that's the voice of your fake beta that has been instilled in you, taking over your natural alpha instincts.

Retarded ideologies which go against rationality and biology: feminism, gay acceptance, veganism, fat acceptance.

Cheap pleasures such as: 24/7 pornography, junk food, sugar, on demand pointless entertainment (netflix, youtube, tik tok).

Mind games: the purposeful lack of certain education, the purposeful miseducation in some areas, slave 9-5 working making you believe you're a champion, meanwhile you're making some other dude rich.

They want you to be a mindless zombie.  ""Don't brag, be humble"" ""Stop judging people"" ""Accept them for who they are"". They want you to have no personality. To be like a falling leaf, floating in whatever direction the wind blows.

They feed you cheap pleasures. Junk food. Stupid entertainment. Crap medicine.  Filling your brain with cheap dopamine.  Keeping you docile, like a tranquiliezed lion in a cage.

You think you're a good man, because you believe in God, you go to work, you get your monthly salary, you fuck your wife and raise your kids, which you do... but you're doing it on their terms. You're not free, you're theirs, until you break out of this mental pattern.

Fuck them.  The only way out of the cage is by forming your OWN opinions.  You don't like fat people? Good, me neither, fuck them, fat shame them until they lose weight.  You don't like hobos? Good, me neither, fuck them, they should go to work and not beg like some losers.

5418,5419,"A question related to womans reproductive health and research.Honest question about issue facing woman reproductive health.

The other day a friend of mine got some eggs frozen because she was going to have to go through Chemo and most likely become infertile.  

The process to due so is for lack of a better word intense and actually not without risk.  And the chance of them being viable isnt even super high. 

This got me thinking. 

Freezing storing sperm is easy well researched and often has a high success rate.

It not the case for females and maybe the reason is actually the process.   

It can take up too two weeks, you can be unable to do normal activity for up to a week after wards and that is all with no complications. 

My question was knowing that the amount of research put into freezing eggs is rather low compared to the research into freezing sperm [i mean compare the process and just how hard getting samples would be.  With eggs being so much harder to obtain less people donate to science plus you get much less at once per person] should instead of focusing on using the current method, should more research money be spent on a safer way to induce ovulation and for removal instead of focusing so much on raising the egg survival rate? 

Edit: sorry if this is a confusing mess I am not the best at writing out what I am thinking.

The question is in short: due to the risky nature of the current process to indue ovulation for freezing eggs, would it make more sense to spend the research money on a safer way to induce ovulation instead of just on how to raise the success/survival rate of frozen eggs since a safer [and hopefully much cheaper] process would make it more accessible to more woman.  And more accessibility would equal more control over when and were you want kids and the ability too still have them later in life.

While I do agree more money should be invested on reducing how invasive the process is (and how difficult the procedure is to undergo and recover from) for people with ovaries, because they are internal organs and testes are external, there's only so much that can be done in that respect as well. I think because of those hard limitations on the potential advancements for oocyte collection, research has focused on making the eggs collected more viable for longer-- specifically because they are harder to get in the first place.

I don't see this as an injustice-- it's just the result\* given the reality of biological differences.",0

This makes it very easy for authors to copy one another, which is why ever since Sword Art Online blew up isekai has not only become popular but each isekai story is super derivative and formulaic when you compare them to each other. Sure there are a few exceptions but for the most part you can tell exactly what the author had already read/watched when they made their own isekai. The market has become so flooded online that people have started getting *really* creative with their story titles because something as Moonlight Breakfast doesn't quite grab the reader's attention as much as Who In Their Right Mind Would Make Toast With Their Butt. So what happens is officials take a look at what LNs online are popular, the LN gets a real book deal and published in meat space while an anime is adapted asap to cash in on its popularity. The market has also become so flooded that over the past few years they've started to pull away from ""teenage male protagonist"" stories so authors started developing new gimmicks such as reincarnation.",0

5490,5491,"When is it okay for men to wear feminist things?Hi there. I'm a 20-something year old male and recently I kinda got in touch with my angsty side. Listening to punk rock and the sorts. I also care a lot about social equality movements. So I recently got a jean jacket and decorated it with different patches. Two of those patches were a Rosie the Riveter and Feminism patch. One of my friends said it was kinda cringe that I had them on there because I wasn't a girl and it comes off as ""white knighty"". Which makes me feel weird about having them on there. I thought it was important to show solidarity with the feminist movement because I grew up with a sister and its been amazing to see how its affected her and the woman she's become because of it. I truly believe in the cause and have been involved with the cause for a long time now.

5521,5522,"A class 12 student allegedly committed suicide in Gurugram's residential condominium by jumping from the balcony of his flat. IANs has reported that he jumped from the 11th floor of the building.

As per a report in the Hindustan Times, he was accused by a girl of molestation on social media, the police said. He was named in a MeToo post on social networking site Instagram. The post from the girl came on the day when the Bois Locker Room group controversy came to light, which has triggered nationwide outrage.

HT mentions an officer saying: No suicide note was found but messages retrieved from the boys phone showed that fellow students warned him that he will be questioned by the police.

Reports say that the police are investigating the deceased boy's alleged involvement in Bois Locker Room Instagram account. His phone has been seized and sent for analysis. The cyber crime cell has been looped in. His social media account and chats will be investigated to help understand why he took the extreme step.

The report says, ""The police official ruled out any foul play during preliminary investigation. The deceased has not left any suicide note. Further action will be taken only after detailed reports of his mobile analysis is received. As of now, legal proceedings under CrPC 174 have been initiated.""

As NCR fights against the Covid-19 situation, the incident involving a group of social media users on Instagram came to light. The incident, now known as Bois Locker Room incident, made news after a girl from South Delhi shared a screenshot on social media. The screenshot went viral.

The screenshot brought to light the activities on this particular group, where the users, as it appeared on the screenshot, showed school boys sharing photos of underage girls. The chats have shown the boys to have objectified the girls and to have planned 'gang rapes'.

Almost all the 21 members of the group have been identified. They will be examined.

Owing to the lockdown, the 15-year-old apprehended has not yet been produced before the juvenile justice (JJ) board, this report says.

The boy is said to have told counsellors and police that he was added by a classmate to the group during the last week of March.

After some days, they added a total of 51 people to their group and also made another group. Some of them allegedly started sharing photos posted by girls on their Instagram accounts. Some allegedly shared morphed photos as well, the Indian Express report quotes an officer saying.

Deccan Herald says in its report that the Cyber Cell had filed an FIR in the case under sections 67, 67(A) of the Information Technology Act, and other IPC Sections. The case was filed on 4",0

This happened in news with a weeks time and a boy already suicide, some of them are <15yr olds.

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.  Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue.

^2  Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever).  Dont over plan.  

^3  Mild condescension is ok.  Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.  Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid.  Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.",1

Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

-Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)**

Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue.

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.

I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action.

5554,5555,"Great post with usable tactics.

There should be a ""Tactics"" flair for these posts, versus ""Theory"" posts.

I never had trouble, generally speaking, with confidence. But all the little behavioral cues that society ingrained into me as ""right"" and ""correct"" had to be shed before I first really  felt the power of TRP. Even little Beta shit like saying ""sorry"" when I bump someone at the store. It all had to be shed, but it also had to be replaced with something.

And for me, anyway, it was finding and implementing the right *tactics* in place of all the bullshit that I was filled up with. So it's great to say ""do not give a fuck"" but how does that actually look in context.

What I find, much like V. reports, is that women will resort to overt communication if you're just nailing the tactics:

Overt communication in this context means you're doing it right.",0

5565,5566,"Is it just me or is it time to normalise non-invasive vasectomies the way we do IUDs? #ittakestwoBefore anyone gets defensive, lets break this down. Non-invasive vasectomies are...NON-INVASIVE. Theyre an outpatient procedure and after reading a lot about it, theyre compared to dental procedures that you can drive home from, and the worst part is the pain of anaesthetics. The only issue seems to be that vasectomies are harder (and completely possible) to reverse, and that insurance doesnt cover reversal (but they do cover vasectomies).

Now lets discuss IUDs. In a lot of countries, people who havent given birth aret considered for IUD procedures and some countries administer local anaesthesia. Im not mentioning it because I agree, but because of the implications of severity. Most women are given ibuprofen, which doesnt do much considering you have to push past the cervix opening (that is closed tight) with a rod to insert an IUD. For those who are having a hard time imagining, think about a hard rod being shoved up your urethra. 

As for side effects, where do I even begin? Constant bleeding for 1-6 months after the insertion? Weight gain? Acne? Fever and debilitating cramps after insertion? Severe PMS mood swings that border on clinical depression? Life threatening (ectopic) pregnancy? Irregular/heavy bleeding until its taken out? Increase risked of infections? Perforation (piercing through the uterus wall)? Extreme cramping with a copper (non-hormonal) IUD?

I am sick and tired, and frankly, disgusted, by the pressures put on women to be the ones responsible for birth control when it takes two to reproduce. And for the people who think: not my body, not my problem, you think paying for an abortion or child support is a risk not worth taking? Birth control comes with awful side effects, and do you know how stressful it is to take a pill at the same time everyday? Do you know what its like to make plans always having to consider that? Compared to a one-time non-invasive, outpatient procedure that has the highest rates of preventing pregnancy?

I see high school and college students taking responsibility and getting IUD insertions. Its about time we start calling out absurd double standards and placing responsibility on all participating parties.

Dear women, dont feel discouraged. Im iffy about talking to my male friends about this but what seems to separate the boys from the men is that while boys remain self-centred and self-involved, men understand my stance and even begin to agree with it.

I want to reiterate, Im not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves. Im here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them.

#ittakestwo

[Edit: I dont know if vasectomies are a viable solution. BUT...I would like to point out the discrepancy in the way we discuss what men might have to endure and what women have repeatedly endured. If theres such a huge burden on women, isnt it worth it to discuss and explore a variety of solutions no matter how bizarre they might seem before shutting it down completely? Are womens burdens THAT insignificant that we immediately shut down something that seems scary but may or may not be scary in actuality? THAT insignificant that we shut down solutions because the IDEA of it causes discomfort? THAT insignificant that possible pain takes priority of actual pain?]",0

I think that OP did a great job of presenting their argument and I see no effort to pit people against one another.

I'm not well enough informed about the science regarding IUD and vasectomy to suggest that one is better than the other, but I'm all for people taking responsibility and making informed decisions about birth control.",0
5568,5569,"Im not saying one is better then the other. Thats a very holistic thing. But I will say that statistics support vasectomies being the most potent form of birth control  how-not-to-get-pregnant

My main issue is the double standards. Women already have to go through enough with menstrual cycles and pregnancies. Im not saying women have it better or worse than me, just that reproduction is a particularly difficult aspect. Menstruated cycles and pregnancy already hurt women. Birth control hurts women even more. 

So hopefully by talking about male birth control, starting a conversation, debunking myths, reporting statistics and facts, we can facilitate a safe environment where men can learn/talk about birth control, see the pain that women bear, and can normalise taking responsibility in a completely safe and healthy way.create a safe environment where taking some responsibility doesnt mean hurting yourself in the process",0

TBH, Ive read an innumerable amount of articles on google and formulated opinions accordingly. I read articles that support or negate points of views so I dont succumb to confirmation bias. I know just because an article is on google doesnt make it accurate but its a good starting point.

TL;DR
Ive read too many articles and dont know enough to suggest any as additional information",0
5570,5571,"Agreed! It does take two and I wish there was an alternative to the pill on the market for men. But from studies on hormonal birth control for men, it looks like men aren't all that willing to put a bunch of foreign hormones, that can alter their lives and have a bunch of side effects into their bodies. Women don't really have the luxury to say no to birth control. I have a feeling it will take a long time for young men to accept even non-invasive vasectomies as a viable birth control method, because it is seen as something men get who know they're done having children.",0
5571,5572,"I think normalizing the conversation should 100% be on the table. Whether or not it's feasible yet comes later. Men shouldn't be afraid of a possible option for something like this.


Bonus rant incoming:

My biggest frustration comes from the fact that women are often given the responsibility of contraception. Birth control pills, IUDS, tying tubes, the morning after pill. Men who are sexually active should not have to be asked to put a condom on, even when women are using another form of BC. If both parties agree not to use condoms, that needs to be agreed to as the follow-up. I'm sick of feeling bad for men who say condoms don't feel as good, completely ignoring the suffering women go through to be the responsible party. Let's also not ignore the cost. If you don't wear a condom, you should have to *at least* pay for half of the morning after pill. This drives me mad. I pay for period supplies and BC pills, monthly. The least men could do is pay for some condoms and morning after pills.",0
5572,5573,"This! My boyfriend paid half of my IUD, because he's the reason I got it in the first place.",0
5573,5574,"Its really hard not to get angry that this is the first time Ive ever even heard of this procedure. 

It needs to be a main stream option. Why is it not?

Ladies, I dont want to scare anyone out of an IUD by saying this, because it was 1,000% worth it, but holy shit it was the most painful thing Ive experienced in my adult life. I have absolutely no sympathy for anyone who might argue this procedure is too invasive for men.

There isn't necessarily just one norm, there can be different norms enforced and approved by different groups.  If you don't conform to the jock norm, maybe you can conform to the punk norm and you fit in there.  We internalize the norms and use them to define ourselves and they also limit us and our expressions of who we are.

5604,5605,"Had my first date in 3 months. Accidentally blew my load in a minute - Can this be salvaged?Well boys - Have I got a story for y'all.  I welcome any words of advice, wisdom, or how to play this moving forward.

Like many of you, I've been in quarantine for the past 2 months. Finally, in the last 2 weeks, I decided to say fuck it and download Tinder again. Before that, I was doing some solid self-introspection, reading, home workouts, learning to trade options, no drinking, no weed, lots of meditation. All was well. I was feeling great!

During this time, I also stayed away from Porn and only jacked it once a week to no porn.

Fast forward to yesterday and I had my first outside date with a bird in that span of time. Super fucking cute, short Asian girl with amazing tits. I took her to my usual spot, which is this outdoor walking street with cafes and whatnot. We grab some cold drinks and start working around the area. All was going phenomenal with exceptional banter, kino, easy-flowing conversation, etc.

I said let's get outta here and we headed back to my place to 'watch a documentary' as that's what it said she liked to do in her profile.

We hung out on the couch, more kino, kissing, slowing escalating, she's getting wet and ready to go. It's getting to the point where she has to go home, but I take is LMR and just keep escalating.

Eventually, her dress on the floor and those gorgeous fucking tits are flopping around in my face.

We're both naked and eventually, I caveman carry her to my bed. We're still working up to sex, which is fine, so I flip her around and we start 69'ing.

Well here's where it all went to hell! After 2 months of quarantine, and not even having the chance to touch a bird, I fucking let myself accidentally get way over-excited, and as she's giving me the best head this side of 6 months - using her mouth in ways only god knows  - before you know it I'm shooting a giant premature fucking load in her mouth. I lasted maybe a minute. Not my proudest minute at that. I had no problem when she was jacking me off vigorously, but as soon as she went down on me, while I'm eating her out, I fucking lost it.

I haven't cum this fast in years.

To make matters worse, she jumps up and runs to the bathroom to spit out my spunk, just leaving me sitting there on the bed.  I mean, maybe she was surprised at my load, maybe I fucking hit the back of her throat. I don't fucking know.

She comes back out of the bathroom, and I try to play it off as if I'm just gonna finish her. I go down on her for a little bit longer and she says she needs to finally get home - it's 11:30 pm and she has to wake up at 7 am. I say cool and here's where she proceeds to give me the ego dick punch of death. ""Oh - you came so fast"" in what can only be described as a disappointing tone.

I wasn't quick enough on my feet to come up with a good line, but I also didn't fucking show emotion either. I just played it off to quarantine and not having any action in a while. Just like it was no big deal, and just hoping it was a shit-test. So many other things I could have said, trust me I know. But the damage was done and my ego lay in tiny fucking shards all over the floor.

So boys - what do you think? Any chance of salvaging this. I feel like there's no fucking way I'm gonna contact her now. Gonna just have to wait for her.  And if she does contact, I'll just never bring it up again like it never even happened. Again - every other part of the date was great. I actually enjoyed conversing with her. That is the first time in a while.

Thing is, I've got 3 more dates lined up with 3 different birds this week alone, but I'll be dammed if my ego won't let me forget this performance. Of course, I want the revenge fuck now to show her what I can really do in bed.

What do you think lads?

**Edit #1**: She literally just reached out asking for some innocuous link to another documentary I had mentioned. If she really wanted to ghost, she wouldn't have contacted at all, I think.

**Edit #2:** Lads, you're all legends! Cheers for the solid advice from all of you. I truly appreciate it. Some hard lessons to learn, but that's all part of the process.

Thank you for all of the support. I didnt think Id get it. Ive posted on reddit so much for therapeutic reasons and met with a lot of hostility. I decided to just grow up and realise I was being an IDIOT. Ive had female friends, Ive got with girls in the past, I dont deserve this idiocy and neither do women or those around me. I am gonna change, but not to get laid or anything. Actually, I suspected that I wouldnt ever get laid and I literally didnt care - because I wanna love women not hate them, have a healthy mindset to benefit my happiness and those around me. However it turns out Im actually fairly cute - so fixing my mindset and being happy, I might actually attract a girl, if I am lucky. But if it dont: its okay. Im not entitled to anything and if I was never to meet another woman again in my life, I still dont want this hate and sadness in my heart. Thanks for all the replies and the many who private messaged me, which all of them were women bar one - which is just a great show of how kinda women can be and how diverse and different they are. 

Ive got friends, I was working out and continue to do so, I have hobbies but I wanna develop more, try out any sport I can once I get to college, go to college to better myself, all the while working on myself. I feel as if the past year of depression and suicidal thoughts are coming to an end - I have hope again. Thanks everyone",0
5615,5616,"I'm glad you're leaving that ideology behind. You're so young, you got your whole life ahead of you. Letting go of the hate is the best thing you can do for yourself.",0
5616,5617,"Agreed. I was waiting for a girl to come along and save me. 

Im embarrassed. It was pathetic and I feel awful that I was so entitled and put so much standards on women, that theyre supposed to be perfect, and one should come along and save me. Disgraceful. 

Women are flawed, and there are bad ones - that doesnt mean they arent beautiful. I have to start seeing women as individuals. Respecting them and respecting myself. 

I probably will never get laid, as I havent done so already. Im not that special, girls dont have to date me or have sex with me. Rather than being bitter about it, and blaming women - Im learning that my mindset is harmful to me and those around me. So, Im content with never having sex or being with a girl, thats their choice to not want me: however, I will love women, not be so entitled and pathetic, and have a healthy mindset for MY happiness. I feel quite good about myself now :)",0

My first boyfriend was a misogynist, although I was too nave to see it at the time, and his belief in false statistics and social issues really affected the way he treated me and other women in ways I dont think even he realized at the time. Antifeminist/incel/redpill ideology is harmful for both women AND men, as Im sure youve experienced first hand when it comes to potential feelings of self-loathing or anger. Deconstructing some of the things you believe because of your time in these communities will really help you in the long run, I think.

Additionally, if hbomberguy doesnt really float your boat, maybe watch some of Vaushs videos on the incel community. (Many will pop up if you type in Vaush incel in the YouTube search bar.) You really dont -have- to watch anything, but I do think it could be beneficial for you in deconstructing your past beliefs. Another good thing might be counseling or therapy, if you live in a place where health insurance covers those things. Also, if youre planning on going to college, many universities will offer a few free counseling sessions every quarter. :) hope that helps",0

If you talk to a girl at a bar, start with general banter, and make sure you and her have some back and forth that can lead to more physical escalation. Chasing is when you put the girl before everything. It means you are always the first to text her, you're always checking up on her, you reinitiate everything always. She needs to feel you might not text her, she needs to have space from you. You need to make sure she is doing something. When you do all the work, you are ""forcing"" it to workout.

You're overthinking things if you're at the point where you're wondering if she'd be even interested in your lifestyle. You're the prize, it doesn't matter.

""Men dont dress for women to find them attractive. They dress so other men do not hurt them.""
I take issue with this for a couple reasons. 

1. Men absolutely do dress and behave in a way they think will attract women. Currently, most women are not willing to date gender non-conforming men, and that will have to change in order for straight men to be willing to stray from gender norms.

5674,5675,"I had a middle school teacher like this. She was so mean to me because everyone else was. And she was the ""cool"" teacher who would crack jokes and so the kids really liked her.",0
5675,5676,"My teachers were generally pretty kind to me -- because I was a star pupil with a genuine love for learning and a creative, out-of-the-box perspective on just about every topic. HOWEVER, when I was bullied in class, they would do nothing to stop the bullies from picking on me. When I complained, they told me that without proof there was nothing they could do.

One day, in 7th grade, I brought a tiny recording device (this was in the late '90s, when dinosaurs walked the Earth and smart phones were not yet a given), and used it to record my bullies' merciless insults during our group lab. I planned on using the recording as proof of my suffering so maybe the teacher could intervene. Unfortunately I became upset and let the head bully know I was recording him. He immediately told the teacher I was recording him and the teacher, with an apology, confiscated my device.

There was another time in 6th grade where my bully was punished, but I was punished for my reaction to the bully. The bully in question publicly and loudly accused me of m""\*%$\*@$ing in the bathroom during an indoor recess held in the gym, and I left school right then and there, riding my bike home in the snow to escape the humiliation. My bully received 3 after-school detentions for her action, and I received a single day of in-school suspension (I got to do all my schoolwork and homework privately in school, and then read all day, not that much of a punishment).

There was also the time some idiot etched a b@mb threat across the bathroom walls in 9th grade, and a few bully types decided to accuse me. I was, of course, called into the school psychologist's office and questioned. And of course when I tried to explain my suicidal thoughts resulting from years of bullying to that same school psychologist, I was sent to a hospital for a suicide risk assessment. Same after the 11th-grade ""Project Love"" anti-bullying seminar, in which I publicly announced the division between school-aged ""Predators"" and ""Prey Animals"" and theorised that merciless bullying by the stronger ""Predators"" was a subconscious attempt to convince the less popular among the population to off ourselves, culling the herd until only the more desirable folks remained.

I have been with a lot of women, both hookups and relationships but I never believe they are actually attracted to me. I always rationalize the attraction in an Incel way. Whenever I see couples in public I assume the woman isn't actually attracted to the man unless hes conventionally attractive. In my mind, women have a dual mating strategy. Either the guy is hot and the girls passionately desire him in a lustful, sexual way, or he is not and the woman tolerates the way he looks and is with him for money, status, or personality traits. How do I stop thinking like this?",1
5788,5789,"You are never going to get the reassurance of the subjective experience of others. I'm married and I've been with my partner for a decade. Is he with me because I make incredible lasagna? Because he loves me in a cosmic, unchangeable way? Because he wants me in a lustful way? Because I was convenient? Well, yes. All of that, at times, and probably more reasons. I honestly have no idea most of the time. A decade-long thing doesn't last on lust alone. So it's a bit of everything, I'm guessing, but I really have no way of measuring his subjective experience of me. So, for my peace of mind, I don't really try to do that. I am not, inherently, interested in how his brain engages with his choice to be married to me, it's just not that important. I can't know it, it wouldn't change anything material about my experiences with him, and it really is none of my business anyway. 

Other people's experience of me isn't my business. 

All I can control, all I have power over, is how I am treated and what kinds of experiences I want in my life. That's it. I can solicit behaviors, I can reject behaviors, but ultimately that's all I can sway. My husband treats me like he loves me in a cosmic way. He treats me like he wants me sexually. He treats me like I make great lasagna. And sometimes he treats me like a fixture in his life he doesn't have to question and can just rely on automatically, which I appreciate since I do it too. His behavior matches with my internal set of expectations for how someone who loves me would behave, and he says he loves me, so that's good enough. I don't really need to interrogate if what I think about as love and what he thinks of as love are identical experiences or motivated for the right reasons. The experience of being loved by him *is* acceptable, so that's good enough. 

All anyone can do is tell you and show you their truth. If they tell you they want you and they show you they want you, that's as much as you'll ever get. If they tell you they respect you and they treat you respectfully, that's all you'll ever get. All you can do is set expectations about what level of commitment, love, and respect is required for you to be intimate with someone and go from there. You get to set your expectations for how you want to be treated and people can meet them or not. You further decide to put up with it or not. For now, in human history, you're never going to get to look behind the curtain and see someone's real motivations, to experience their reasoning and desire, to get capital 'T' Truth on how they feel about you. 

Self-esteem is a real kick in the teeth on this one. It is the force that informs you when you're being tolerated as opposed to cherished. It's what tells you that your subjective experience of your beauty is the only thing that matters, that evidence of someone's lust must be a lie. If you hate yourself, you'll never believe that the words and behaviors you're experiencing are truthful because, how could they be? And, really, no one will ever be able to tell you differently because that's the entire toolbox at their disposal. But that's not their failing to impart their truth, that's your inability to read it and accept it. As a result, a lot of people only accept people with nasty, cruel behaviors and words because that feels more real, somehow, or at least offers up something believable. Swing a dead cat and you'll probably hit someone willing to treat you badly and confirm your bad self-assessment. So, yeah, in the most obnoxious way possible, a lot of this comes down to fixing your own internal metrics for the expectations you set, the behaviors you'll tolerate, the evidence you'll find convincing. Which just...sucks. Because that's hard, painful work that takes a long time to internalize. But doing it makes everything so, so much nicer.",0

5797,5798,"How to handle intimacy changes due to Covid-19 at my man's request**(Update: We talked about it, and as it turns out we were both waiting for the other person to say they felt okay with the boundary being dissolved. This sounds so silly now, but I guess me asking him if he still wants something doesn't communicate how I feel about it. He can't look after my needs properly if I don't tell him how I feel. We're resuming the intimacy as we're both on the same page about what's safe for us, problem solved!)**

My boyfriend and I have been together for \~9 months, and we love each other. The last time we saw each other ""normally"" before things got serious in our state (e.g. lockdowns began) was in mid-March. Since then, I have been at his place one time (toward the end of March) because he lives with his father at the moment, and they both have been vigilant about not allowing anybody else at the house. Both of them have been able to return to work safely as of the second week of May. We're still seeing each other on the weekends, like clockwork -- just in my part of town, or at an outdoor midpoint we can both get to such as a state park. And fortunately, no one in either of our social circles has tested positive, and neither have we.

The main struggle I'm having is this: Since mid-March, at his request, we have not kissed on the lips/made out. Our intimacy has not gone past hugging or cuddling, and even then it's not prolonged. Keep in mind, we had not gone past making out ever in our relationship, mainly because both of us have been moving slowly for our own reasons. I am big on giving and receiving physical touch, particularly through physical intimacy, so to have this part of our relationship almost disappear for two months has been really hard for me. I know he's having a hard time too for the same reason, but every time I've asked him what he thinks, he's stated that he doesn't like having this boundary, but he hasn't changed his mind.

My question is: I've never once nagged him or tried to manipulate him into changing his mind about this. I know he's just using his judgment to try and keep me safe, since he's told me that he's more worried about spreading the virus to me (his county has way more cases than mine). I've known him for almost a year before we got together, and I do trust him: He's not abusive or controlling or on some power trip by shutting kissing down. And I know that once things calm down, and he feels we're both safe enough, our physical intimacy will come back with a fury. **But I've never been in a healthy LTR for this long. So I've never really had a relationship before where I have to trust a man unconditionally with a temporary change that (1) I'm chafing against like crazy, and (2) don't how long I'll have to go along with. This, I think, is the root of the issue. As a RPW, what should I do?**",0

Frankly, he's being paranoid and buying into the fear that the media has been shoving down everyone's throat. Unless I'm missing info where one or both of y'all are obese, you should have no issues sharing a kiss and hug. He can't reasonably expect you to not kiss him for months on end, even a year or longer. I commend you for going as long as you have and for the level of respect that you've been showing him. Good job! 

If he understands how you feel and still insists on the no-kiss/hug policy, ask him how long does he anticipate it to last. What exact guidelines is he going off of? Is it purely what makes him feel safe, his emotions, or is he basing his decision off facts? Is he deducing or listening to other people? 

Your action will depend on the answers. I would not want to continue a relationship with someone who's paranoid. I would not want to continue a relationship with someone who easily believes what others say. I would want to be with an intelligent, healthy person who questions just about everything and verifies information before drawing to conclusion and especially before making a decision that involves or affects other people.",0

He said that he'd ""better become a feminist"" then.

New to the gender pay gap report for 2020 is analysis on the impact of lost wages on lifetime earnings. By calculating presumptive raises given over a 40-year career, we find that women in the uncontrolled group stand to lose $900,000 on average over a lifetime. Lost earnings narrow to $80,000 for the controlled group, but this is still significant, especially if you consider how lost earnings due to the gender pay gap would grow with compound interest if invested each year for 40 years.""

As for other comparable crimes I meant like people who killed another person by accident, or trafficked illegal drugs. Obviously killing people is wrong and depending on where the drugs came from they may have been indirectly supporting other crimes such as human trafficking.

If she pulls away and back off from a date, shrug it off, put a 2 or 3 months timer on and wait for her to either contact you or the end of the timer where you can send a feeler text to see what she is up to. Still not available for date? no problem, reset the timer again

If you keep repeating the process and that she had some interest initially it's very likely, you'll end up hooking up at some point",0

5873,5874,"My most recent girlfriend was like this, she just kept curving and curving, but you really have to play with your gut, some girls its pretty obvious shes just playing games, but with her, it was clear that she was just fresh out of a relationship, and scared of men, essentially. If a girl seems interested when you text her, but then leaves you on read after a while, understand that its either this, or in all likelihood, you arent the only guy she is talking to. (Shocker, I know.) I dont typically entertain girls who send one word replies, and then leave me on read after a while, in fact, Im usually the one who leaves the girl on read at this point, but if she is generally engaging, might be worth playing the long game. The best advice I can give though, dont double text on the same day, thats a mistake I made for a long time, and it was impulsive. It also helps to have them on multiple platforms, my last girlfriend for example, I finally got a first date with her through the Instagram DMs, and the rest is history.",0

Past 12 months:

* For men the proportion experiencing physical violence was 5.4% in 2016. 

* For women, the proportion was 3.5% in 2016.

Please note that this is physical assault only and does not take into account stalking, sexual assault etc. where the disparity goes the other way.

5892,5893,"On the perception that feminism blames men for everything.This is a common sticking point and a common criticism of feminism coming from MRA-aligned people. Here is my best attempt to summarize the issue:

Most feminists seem to believe that patriarchy and misogyny are the only valid lens through which to look at mens issues. The ideas of anti-male sexism and misandry are a taboo in feminism. Any double standards that seem to negatively affect men are rationalized as misogyny backfiring. If you talk about an issue where men get the short end of the stick (such as bias in child custody proceedings), feminists are quick to point out that, in fact, patriarchy is responsible for this. If you talk about how men are shamed for showing emotions (by both men and women), feminists are quick to point out that this is a result of misogyny  that showing emotion is considered feminine and thus inferior. Therefore the blame falls on patriarchy again. 

To a non-feminist, this leads to the impression that feminists are blaming men (as a class) for all gender-based unfairness. In fact, the eagerness with which feminists blame patriarchy suggests that they think its very important that everyone understands exactly where the blame should lie (on men).

Feminists, do you agree with the perception that you blame men, as a class, for most (or all) gender-based unfairness? Do you think that its important to acknowledge that the blame lies on men? Where do you think the balance falls between class-based and individual repsonsibility?

Is it possible for feminists and progressive MRA's to reconcile this difference of opinion?",0
5893,5894,"I feel like the way people on this subreddit define feminism requires me to not identify as a feminist while on this subreddit.

I agree that there are a lot of feminists whose views are very shallow and kinda selfish. I don't really participate in mainstream feminist spaces or whatever, so I might be out of touch, idk. But I don't blame people who think that a lot of feminists are mean to men. I'm not smart or a social scientist, I don't read books by feminists or follow feminist twitter accounts, so don't ask me to defend this or that feminist figure.

But I think that patriarchy isn't really men's fault. It's the fault of conservatism, maybe. Gender roles exist for a reason, but they're outdated now. The people who keep clinging to them and enforcing them unnecessarily include men and women, so it's not a men problem.",0
5894,5895,[removed],0
5895,5896,"This is a good question OP... I hope we can get some feminists perspectives on addressing this, as there are feminists who do not think like this (sadly they are not the ones in power). Let me show a case in point:

So what you said has real effects and is not just theory. For example feminists blocking the only ever male welfare officer at university in the ENTIRE UK. Making a campaign against him so he stepped down and it never went ahead:

>Olivia Bailey, NUS national women's officer, said: ""Discrimination against men on the basis of gender is so unusual as to be non-existent, so what exactly will a men's society do?"" ""To suggest that men need a specific space to be 'men' is ludicrous, when everywhere you turn you will find male-dominated spaces,"" she added.

I mean just one rebuttal to that is men are a minority in university. In education an example of flat out sexism and institutional sexism at an international scale (which she denies is):

>Throughout the OECD Teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work to boys. Furthermore, a boy will receive 1/3 higher grade in reading tests if the teacher does not know he is a boy (OECD) From teachers give girls higher grades despite boys objectively getting higher test scores

Someone with some sense:

>As Sarah McCulloch, the female treasurer of the MENS society at Manchester puts it: ""It's important that everyone be included in the discussion about how to create a more equal and fair society, and I don't believe t**hat we will achieve true equality by allowing men to tag along with the women's liberation movement  men have their own problems.""**

So I have learned some feminists are critical of modern feminism and do actually not like this idea of unidirectional power dynamics with men being oppressors and women being victims and patriachy being responsible for womens individual actions (and mens)... this type of feminism needs to raise up and be the loudest voice because at the moment feminism has gone mad. I mean decreeing air conditioning is sexist, sleep is sexist etc.",0
5896,5897,"""The blame game"" implies that this is like a court or something, or a moral judgement of one's soul. I think its a mode people go into when they feel like a component of their identity is being judged. Like white people getting defensive about historical racism. 

What I think is meant is most cases is a critique of actions and a society that people inherited, and what people hear is that they're a bad person for being on the 'wrong side' when it's rarely that accusatory.

5900,5901,"> More specifically, yes, men are and were in largely in charge of the cultural and political forces that have shaped our society.

Personally I think the time of men holding almost all of the cultural power is long past. We're left with the legacy of patriarchy, but each of us, as an individual, can choose to perpetuate it, or to fight it. This is a fight that men and women are a part of equally.

It just feels odd to me that when men's issues are brought up in feminist spaces, there always needs to be the caveat that ""men made it this way"". Why is that so necessary to bring up? Why the need to always take anti-male sexism and re-label it as misogyny? Even if misogyny may have played a part in the formation of a gendered double standard (which personally I would dispute in certain cases), men are suffering from it now. It feels almost like it's intended to downplay the very real struggles men face, or suggest that men alone are responsible for fixing them.",0

As I said, I think that's you feeling blamed rather than it being an act of blaming. Pointing to the history is useful because you can appreciate the steps it took to get to a certain place and which tactics were effective. It also opens a window into what aspects still needs progress.

One night I was extremely bored and thought I might download Tinder, so I did that and I upgraded to gold version. I changed my locations often to many different countries, I also downloaded some apps where you can talk to strangers online. I downloaded an app where you connect with snapchat and you can match with girls and talk to snapchat.
How did this help me?
Well I got some matches and started chatting with some girls from Poland, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, anyway the countries doesnt matter. I felt an immediate ego boost, to see that women from all around the world would want to talk to me. What matters is this, you are attractive, some girls will find you attractive, some wont. What you need to remember is that you are attractive! Anyways when I did this I noticed that I was talking to 10 or more girls that I probably wont ever meet in real life. I wasnt worried that I might say something wrong to drive them away from me, because they are so far away from me that I wont see them in real life. I just had fun and had interesting conversations. The thing is when I started talking to girls with whom I could actually meet up with I wasnt asking myself questions like Did I text her early, did I text her late, did I say something wrong? I just went with the flow and talked to them, I KNEW that I was attractive, I knew that women wanted to have conversations with me. What I got from my experience is that some women will like you and some wont and guess what, thats fine!! If you keep doing this, talking to girls from all around the world, I promise you will improve your confidence and conversation skills!

So to summarize: download many online chatting and dating apps, meet women from all around the world, talk to them, you will see that when you talk to women from far away and when you talk to those women that you can actually meet up that there isnt a difference, you will gain confidence, you will improve your conversation skills, you will improve your text game!

Because if you dont. Then its a good place to start",0
5991,5992,"TLDR:  Make friends then move onto making girlfriends. 



Workout, dress well, smell well, groom the bush (even if you arent getting laid, the idea is to act like you are).



Do you have friends that are girls? Talk to them on how to improve your style. If not, then you can ask a girlfriend of one of your friends.


Be confident, talk crisply and clearly. Before you try to get a girlfriend, I'd suggest getting girl-friends. Since you're working, ask on of your girl coworkers out for coffee or something (specify its not a date and just as friends).


You need to get confident with talking to girls and touching them. Learning to differentiate between a friendly touch and a flirty one is very important.


Be genuinely nice, dont try and fake a personality. Often if the girl-friend actually likes you they set you up with one of their friends.",0

5994,5995,"A weapon being used on your mind -- And what you can doDiscussed in greater detail in [my video](https://youtu.be/By8cgQaii5E).

Today's generations have something no other did before.   

Previous generations had access to it but it was much simpler and less damaging if abused. And you likely had to go somewhere in person to acquire it which in itself might have prevented you for fear of embarrassment.   

Access to porn and what is available has become too powerful.  

I remember growing up in the 90's. My friends and I stumbled upon a magazine stash at a nearby construction site. We thought we had just found gold. We each took one of the magazines home.. and guarded it like the One True Ring.   

Fast forward a few years later and those same friends and I are trading floppy disks that could hold a few pictures or maybe 1-2 video clips of 3 or 4 seconds.   

Then a few years later broadband internet starting coming out and was available in my neighborhoods. Back then we called it ""cable internet."" File sharing programs were popular for downloading MP3s but they were also gigantic repositories for adult material. You could type in a search string and click download all. A few hours later you'd have tons and tons of video material.   

Then the streaming sites came and we have today's version of modern porn access.   

I realize many of you might not have a problem with porn. I myself have been able to suppress my use of it. But we are here to help other men. A lot of the guys that read this site are young and might be struggling with this. I used to struggle before I knew I was struggling with it.  

At this point I believe porn is a weapon being used to subdue the desires and passions of millions of men around the world. Think about it. There is a reason why Russia and China both have laws banning the production of it. These are our rivals... and they must be laughing knowing Americans and Westerners are mostly subdued by this degeneracy. Blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis.   

As someone who has used Porn while in an LTR and then stopped using it there is a big difference in sexual pleasure once you abstain. Death Grip is real and makes real sex less pleasurable. Once you beat death grip sex will feel like losing your virginity every time. If you're not whacking it often you won't be suffering from death grip but it is real for those whacking it on a nightly basis.   

And for those who think approaching women is not worth it... That's likely your opinion because you have an outlet for your desires. Take that outlet away and your sexual drive will take off like a rocket ship and you will inevitably become good at cold-approach because you will have no other choice.  

There is no shame in admitting you might have a problem and there are tools that can help. Porn blocking tools exist and work in multiple ways. Of course they can't stop you on every single device you own so you'll need some discipline.  

The NoFap community on this website and other places is also very helpful for support and questions.  

Other men will literally jump in a cold shower in the first few days of abstaining if they must.  

There is no shame if you have been a victim of this.  

Again, not all of you will be in this position. You might be enjoying a good porn-laced whack every now and then and that's fine. And some of you might already know that you can whack it without porn entirely and its much healthier for you. I'm definitely not advocating for pure noFap forever. Just don't let it get out of control. Build your power and testosterone by keeping it in your balls for a week or so before release if you're by yourself.  

And remember, dating use app is on the rise even on lock-down. Women are horny and alone and want a man to get in bed with them regardless of the local rules of social-distance in place.

Lessons learned:  

\-My opinion on Porn is that it is a tool used by rival governments to hurt the men of The West.  

\-Death grip is real and comes from nightly porn use. It will prevent you from feeling maximum pleasure when having sex.  

\-Daily use of Porn is hurting your motivation to speak to women and form relationships.  

\-Tools exist to prevent or curb porn use and there are other methods you can do to help in the form of distracting yourself.

They ban production of it because their society is based more so around judaeo-Christian values and they dont promote for personal freedom.

They also censor any website or article that says something bad about the government

>Blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis.   

(If your being hyperbolic my bad for taking it seriously) Fapping has no significant effect on testosterone,every study that depicts a change in testosterone all show  the same result,testosterone goes up on day 7 of abstinence then goes back to normal on day 8.

And having real sex had the same effect on testosterone",0
5998,5999,"I am not sure about the conspiracy thing, but for having directly experimented with its effects, I can tell you that yes, porn has devastating effects on sexuality and arousal. But you know what? Good for the rest of us. I am in my 40s, I have seen quite a bit, and I can tell you than women nowadays dont get enough attention. Back in the days, men would chase women and we were ready to do anything for you know what. Women would get annoyed by our horniness, and we would get accused of being only interested in sex. This is not happening anymore, and it is very distressing for women. It has considerably changed the balance of power. I have seen women in awe with my dick just because I could raise it, something which at any other time in history would have just been the normal. They would tell me of all their past dates that could not perform, and then they would just worship my dick and giving me anything I wanted just for being hard. Thats something I would not have seen 20 years ago. Sometimes, just being a bit bold and showing sexual interest is enough to get laid.

6029,6030,14 Things You Should Never Apologize For,0
6030,6031,"Wow, this was actually a really helpful read. Particularly for work and going out with friends scenarios. Funny how I often find the need to apologize for some of these things, but when other people do it I instinctively find it a sign of weakness or feel unnecessarily sorry for them.",0
6031,6032,"Overall a decent list, but it's typed in a vacuum and not reality. A couple of thoughts as I read through this:

You can apologize for your appearance if you know you look like a schlub. If you were invited to a dinner, and you thought it was only a 6/10 formal thing, and it turned out being an 8/10 formal thing, it's okay to apologize for being slightly underdressed. It could even be what starts a good conversation, although I wouldn't start with it.

And you should apologize for expressing your emotions if the way you express them is harsh or hurtful to those you're expressing them too. I feel like the way this part was written can be interpreted into it being okay to go off on someone or something. No one ever says what they feel about something every time they feel it, the very second they feel it. Things always get bottled up to a degree. The listicle should mention that not being 100% forthright in your emotions is only natural, and that this is not carte blanche approval to erupt unapologetically.

You could conceivably apologize if you're reaching out too often for help. It means you're aware of the other person's time.

IDK. I just think that we shouldn't be afraid to apologize, instead of looking for every justification NOT to do so. Especially under the guise that it makes you look weak, when apologizing (maybe not *for* something, but *that it happened*) can make you more sincere, trustworthy, and considerate. 

I mean, the rest of the list is good, and even those things I called out, I get where the author is coming from. But people notice when nothing is ever your fault. And it's a major red flag.",0
6032,6033,"First of all thanks for the feedback, and I am not saying that apologizing is a bad thing. This list mentions all the points that don't require a sorry in general. If you feel sorry or regret doing anything wrong then it is very obvious that you must have done something wrong, in that case, you should apologize for it. I don't want to stretch it much, but I really liked your ideology.",0
6033,6034,"I didn't mean to sound overly critical, either. Knowing when and when not to say sorry is a nuanced thing in a lot of cases, but I do agree with a lot of this.",0

Hung them, measured, and measured again.  I'll probably have a cold one and watch the latest episode of Billions before putting together a desk I've had in storage.  Of course, this means rearranging the home office.  I'll probably take a break and walk outside for a half-hour and then finish the job.  I'll break it in with an hour or two of studying.

Maybe I'll just sit in silence and enjoy my thoughts.

6050,6051,"Comments on that tweet brings something very important: The ""Guybrush paradox"" (I refuse to call it a theory). Whereas Guybrush can be flawed, a sex-changed version Galbrush couldn't without copious amount of outrage. 

I say, that's true in the west. But I usually consume media from the east. (Japan, Korean and Chinese comics/shows). They are not affected by that issue at all.

Take for example One Punch Man. You got a woman that's crazy OP in the top S ranks, and also a sister that acts as gatekeeper of lower ranks. They have different character traits, flaws and ideals.

Or Shield Hero. You got high ranking nobles (in a matriarchy) abusing their powers, and at the same time others who aren't. You got average people and slaves. Men or womens, doesn't matter. And of it's been teased that enemies from their invasion waves have at their heads heroes which we have seen 4: a male samurai, a male reaper, a female arch mage, and a female dagger/fan user. Very varied female representarton all around.

Or Bofuri. Main cast is mainly female. One of the rival guild has a female guildmaster who has no confidence in herself. Maple's a dim-witted idiot who'se habit of EATING the obstacles on her way somehow made her the most powerful being imaginable... But she's still a naive idiot under the Demon Lord appearance.

In Soul Land (Korean manwha/show), there's a varied amount of males and females all different, with flaws and all, and the discrimination is based entirely on if they're humans or magical beasts, or class warfare. Womens are pretty powerful in that story.

But if you would try those shows here, they would all be criticised for their depictions of womens. Because outrage scammers needs to scam so that their blackmail gives them another paycheck on their patreon.",0
6051,6052,"See, the problem is you're comparing Western media to Eastern.

In Western media, a character isn't just a character. No, they *represent* an entire class of people! At least, that's how it is to the loudest voices (i.e. ""journalists"" and Twitter-addicted losers). You can't have a Galbrush in Western media, because if she's abused or is a failure, it somehow represents *all women* or how the author *views* all women, and is thus sexist.

In Eastern media, a character IS just a character, and not a vehicle for representation. At least, the media/fans don't treat it as such (unless it's reviewed by Western media idiots, like ANN). So, you *can* have a Galbrush in Eastern media, because she is allowed to be flawed or is allowed to fail or be abused.

You rarely see any ""controversy"" about anime/manga/LNs until they come over here... For example, I believe ANN had interviewed the director or producer of the Goblin Slayer anime (I think?) and asked them about how they handled the controversy over in Japan, and their response was basically ""what controversy?""   
That is to say, it's not like they *don't* get whiners from the East. Like with the recent ""controversy"" over a My Hero Academia villain... it was *Chinese* fans getting angry, claiming the character's name was a WW2 reference... So Horikoshi changes the character's name... and then they're *angry about the new name*, too.",0

It seems like a lot of men in the millennial and gen z age range are really struggling with the sexual marketplace and finding a partner. Judging from my own observations and the discussion I read on the internet (not just on reddit, but across different social media platforms and forums). Women just consider them invisible. Large portions of them aren't having any sex at all, a lot less than previous generations, which means they won't get the chance to have kids unless that changes.

In contrast, it seems like the vast majority of gen x men and boomer men found life partners relatively easily. It seems extremely rare to find a 40+ year old man who hasn't been married, had kids nor had at least one long term partner (unless they are a Chad, but at least they are getting regular sex).

Men are told a lot on here that most men end up finding a partner and having kids, but do you think this will be true of millennial men and gen z men? What do you reckon?",0

Since then, the government has been using more covert methods to manipulate fertility and hormone levels. Misinformation through the use of media is also one of those methods.

6088,6089,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops.

About a month after I blew it with the Filipina chick, I ended up meeting a brunette that was a solid HB9. It was at an upscale cafe I frequent every now and then. Since I emphasize common sense, I didn't walk up to her and say ""holy shit I want you to ride my dick until it looks like a deflated pepperoncini"" but I played it cool conversationally until it was time to bag the number, without any hesitation or planning I said...

&#x200B;

**""Look, you need a man like me in your life.""** I gave her my phone. **""Put your number in my phone and I'll invite you over.""**

She's not stupid. It was very clear I was talking about inviting her over to dick her down. She looked extraordinarily surprised at my forwardness and complied. Two weeks went by (I was extraordinarily busy) and I called her and **told** her I wanted to see her tonight. I gave her my address, we hooked up,  but I decided against plating her because she was psycho and I could tell she had some daddy issues.",0

6106,6107,"1. Whatever vibration you put out, you will attract 

A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners.  Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 

2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play 

One of those factors, sadly, are looks. 
And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or  if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good. 

3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok.  it can be used as a form of endearment. 

You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about. 

4. NOTHING BEATS BEING GENUINE

Regardless if youre quirky or weird, or whatever else, there will be someone who will match or even compliment that and appreciate you for that. BUT  dont fuck it up by acting the way some of these posts are telling you to act like.

6115,6116,"Yeah, I don't know that someone posting that many selfies online constitutes as someone with high self esteem. From what I have observed, it usually means quite the opposite. People's low self esteem can manifest in different ways. Some may show this by not wanting to take or show pictures of themselves. Others may post pictures for the sole purpose of getting people to ""like"" it and compliment them. No one with high self esteem would need that much attention from people. Both cases indicate someone with low self esteem in my opinion. I knew a handful of girls in highschool who had a lot of instagram followers and what not yet they had horrible self esteem for whatever reason. Not getting enough likes on a picture would cause them to delete it.

I am at odds. I realised that I have been treating my boyfriend like my husband - what should I do about this?

 We've been together for 2 years (the first year was on and off and this year has been stable). Yesterday night we were talking on the phone and I joked saying I like the nick name Bubby because its hubby and baby mixed into one. We have been discussing marriage alot since being in Quarantine so I guess I felt comfortable making that joke. Then he said laughing that it was too soon and I shouldn't call him that. That shut me down - it made me realise I have been giving myself to someone as if he were my husband when he doesn't see himself that way or me like his wife. He is a good guy. He is loving and I would like to marry him some day. He said that however and I pretty much hung up and now I have this innate unease when I think about him. 

I know it is not his fault but I think I am more annoyed with myself for getting carried away - I am 20 and he is my first boyfriend so I can see why I fell into this pit of fantasy. When he said that it burst my bubble... I've lost my sexual attraction to him - me and him aren't really tied in any way so why should I give myself? We have treated sex casually in the relationship but I have been moving towards Chastity for a while now so because we are distanced due to this quarantine I have been turning him down for sexting and so on. I dont like sex being so casual anymore? But I was okay with it before? I cant help but see him as a user - even though that's not what is going on... I dont want to see him or have him touch me rn? I know I am being over dramatic. 

So...

What are husband benefits?

What are boyfriend benefits? 

Should I learn to compartmentalise the two? 

What are your experiences? 

How do I make it clear that wifey is something to be earned and that I am no longer going to be the way I was before?

Thank you so much sisters ",0
6169,6170,"You are 20 and your SO is 24, which means he was about 22 when you met and started dating. It is rare that men are dating for marriage at that age. It is unlikely that he is dating you with marriage in mind. 

I was a couple of years older than you when I met my husband, who was in his late 20s at the time. We were both dating for marriage and moved in together after only 6 months and were engaged in less than a year and married less than a year after that. 

Very, very little has changed from the time we started living together and now as far as how we act. There is very little distinction between girlfriend and wife. For most women, the only distinction is allowing the government into your relationship through legal marriage. For some women, it may also mean engaging in physical activity outside of hand holding and side hugs. 

Here, I think the real issue is that your SO is not old enough to truly be prepared for marriage. At your age, relationships tend to take much longer before marriage.  Among my husbands friends, those who met their partners in their early 20s took nearly a decade to propose. In contrast, those who met in their partners in their late 20s and early 30s were ready to commit to marriage in 6-12 months.",0
6170,6171,Theres a lot going on in your post. You say you were off and on the first year maybe thats why he feels like its too soon? Guys like to test relationship out not in a bad way but just to see if it will last. For example my boyfriend just recently started to tell his family about me even though weve been dating for 2 years and I completely understand that it takes time to vet a potential spouse. Also are you withholding sex because you feel like it will give you more power or an upper hand the the relationship? If so then thats the wrong move sex isnt something you give your partner is something you do WITH your partner and if you plan on not having sex when you previous were then it should be a discussion with him.,0
6171,6172,"> I dont like sex being so casual anymore? But I was okay with it before?

You've had a fundamental shift in your thinking, which is perfectly healthy at 20. That being said, he is under no obligation to go along with it and probably won't. You might need to start considering if this is actually the right relationship for you.

Aside from that, husband benefits is an interesting topic. We usually only talk about wife benefits. I would say the following are singular to a husband:

For better or for worse: This pandemic has been really rough on me, on the heels of some other life altering stress. I've not handled it well. Vetting is over, though. We're married and my husband takes that seriously and has been my rock through my stress and tears and paranoia. I have been a *chore* of a wife at times, this year. I would never expect a boyfriend to put up with that.

For richer or for poorer: As your husband, his money is likely yours. Before marriage, anything he buys for you is a gift. Don't forget it and *never* ask for financial help. I actually have a rather long anecdote about my husband thinking I was about to ask for money when we were dating, when it was the furthest thing from my mind. It would have seriously dampened the relationship and he would have refused.

In sickness and in health: It's perfectly acceptable for him to bring you soup when you're sick or hang out with you and watch movie, but he isn't obligated to care for your physical well-being like he would were you married. When I nearly cut off my thumb last year, my husband took off work, rescheduled his call shift, picked me up as my emergency contact, drove me across the city to get stitched up under worker's comp, and stopped to get Chinese food on the way home for me. That is pretty above and beyond and while it would be nice of a boyfriend to do it, I'm not sure it's fair to expect it. The same goes for running out to get medicine or cleaning out the trashcan after you've thrown up.

The mundane: Sharing household chores and responsibilities and daily routines really muddies the water and it's why I caution cohabitation. My husband is in this for life, so cleaning my hair out if the drain is part of that, as are all the other gross parts of living with humans and the pets we share. I would never expect a boyfriend to take responsibility for trimming the dogs' nails, putting up the Christmas lights, chopping up the Christmas tree for firewood, or getting our oil changed. Those are husband tasks, as are the many little chores we've decided to split between ourselves.",0

But I cant help but to be sympathetic because I know the feeling of being excited about someone and being sexually giving at first, and then losing attraction when it starts to become clear that he wont be committing.  Obviously one comment on the phone might not mean much, but it seems like your gut may be telling you there is something to think about here.

She basically said that her virginity is for the guy she will marry and/or consider marriage material and although I like her a lot, I am not sure if I want to sacrifice my freedom for a bit of sex. But she is very to me and we match on a lot of things. I guess I am unsure about what to do.",0

6188,6189,"There is a ""blind leading the blind"" belief in this sub that's hiding in plain sightThat belief is the ""Don't be friends with the girl you're attracted to otherwise you'll be stuck in the friendzone"" belief.

The reason I know that the people who push this idea are ""blind"" or really, inexperienced or just don't know what they're talking about, is because for most of these people, if they have a girlfriend and she's friends with this cool guy and she always hangs out with him, they recognize the possibility that she could cheat on them with him.

But why would you think that she could cheat if befriending a girl supposedly keeps a guy stuck in the friendzone?

Or do the ""rules"" somehow not apply to that guy but they do to you? 

Friendship doesn't put you in the friendzone. 

The friendzone comes as a consolation prize from a girl who rejects your sexual advances and it is also sometimes a way for the occasional girl who has issues to manipulate and take advantage of a guy.

Its not your friendliness that puts you in the friendzone. Its the lack of a girl's attraction for you that does.

You can be that cool guy that all the girls want. Don't listen to blind people who project their own insecurities onto you.

Observe that guy closely and get a feel for how friendly he is.  He isnt very friendly at all, and thus never loses his attractiveness to women and ends up in the FZ as a result.  Thats partially *why* hes the cool guy that all the girls want.  You will note that hes **never** the warm and friendly guy that all the girls want.",0
6193,6194,You right that can put u in the wrong place but i have to say this not every girl the same some u have to move directly to the relationship zone others it would be better to be in the FZ first and that cool guy is because he already build a reputation of being that cool with girls. Think about him im sure he has alot of friends that are girls and boys he usually never alone its not because he is cool that he is never alone or never with one girl its actually the opposite he is cool because he is never alone and usually not with one girl with him. Its just a himan nature when u see many people trying to get something or being around someone its just get us to think that thing or person must be great or cool for those many people to want him.,0
6194,6195,Thats a great point actually im glade someone did say that. But about that statement i think it sould hold true for some of the guys here that only want one night thing or just sex. If thats the case the shouldnt bother being friends with them and I don't think this is the subreditt for that thing that is pick up not seduction.,0

Uhmm... what? That's exactly what friendzone means. You are **just** friends.

However, you are right. If you get friendzoned by a girl and accept to remain friends with her that doesn't mean it's permanent. But if it's intimacy you are looking and you are in a hurry then you'd better go looking for other girls.",0
6196,6197,Being in the friendzone means you're stuck as friends. Being friends means you've just chosen to be friends but can still change that.,0
6197,6198,"You are correct that its about a lack of attraction that creates friendzones. But the rest is nonsense. 

Why would you promote being friends with a girl(s) you want to fuck? If youre trying to get at her, then youre not buddies. If you make it known and she isnt into it (her choice) then what are you gonna do, just hang out w her all the while she knows you wanna fuck her? No. Thats some cake-ass shit. Wtf? 

And if you do end up fucking guess what? Youre no longer friends. However if the vibe is good and the time is right you can develop into a friendship while youre fucking but thats another story. 

Stop playing yourself and stop lying. Youre not interested in being her friend. You want to fuck her.

My major contention is with the idea that we should avoid working on one area of inequality because it is currently in tension with another area - expressed here as the concept that the disparate impact of childbirth and rearing on women should affect our decisions on conscription. This kind of ""tit-for-tat"" inequality, where the argument is that equality of a sort can be reached by a balance of inequalities, is in my opinion a barrier to progress.

6270,6271,Men don't approach anymore ...I hear this quite often by women complaining they don't get approached and it begs the question: are men that bad today? The reason why a man will not approach women is because he had negative past experiences. He has tried several times and failed which makes him even less reluctant to make the next move. I firmly believe this explains why the majority of men don't approach anymore.,0

I fantasise about then revisiting old spaces and groups, and being accepted and welcomed by people who rejected and ignored me in the past. I think about how wonderful it would be to have them invite me out; to be accepted into their friendship circles and belong.

I fantasise about interviewing for respectable posts for which I am well-qualified, and being seriously considered for those posts instead of heaped on the mental reject pile within the first 8 seconds. I fantasise about being able to play attractive and age/gender-appropriate characters onstage.

Yes, I think a lot of us do this as well, even normies.

&nbsp;

> Is this ""maladaptive"", and is there anything wrong with that?

It depends. Like I said, daydreaming is something even normies/NT's will do, it doesn't necessarily have to be bad.

&nbsp;

It becomes ""maladaptive"" when it's used as your preferred coping mechanism for loneliness or boredom (just two examples). Daydreaming might feel nice at the moment you engage in it, but especially the maladaptive kind will take up significant chunks of free time that you could be using to solve the underlying problems that are causing you to daydream in the first place.

&nbsp;

Indicators of daydreaming being maladaptive are for example:

- making facial expressions/talking during daydreaming sessions

- feeling distressed when something is preventing you from daydreaming

- preferring daydreaming over real life activities/socializing

&nbsp;

These are just a few things I remember.

6290,6291,"Red Pill Rage makes you look petty.**Introduction**

I recently had a young man send me a text saying how he is mad at the world, how women are a waste of time, F this F that. He lost his cool. As someone who is older than him and as someone he looks up to, I feel like I am personally responsible for not handling this. So I sat him down for a talk, to explain what he is going through. Red Pill Rage.

**Body**

This is a phase that many men go through after realizing how this world operates. We were once blue pilled simps who were shown the light (or found it/were driven to it). We are now in recovery mode to become who we were biologically born to be. This is a life long process, its slow, but if you are consistent, it will be steady up and up. It's the school of life. You will study, pass, and fail. Its normal.

Someone going through red pill rage will exhibit symptoms including but not limited to:

* Anger and disdain for women
* Anger and disdain for the people who raised him
* Depression and lack of motivation to proceed in the world
* Confusion as to what to do next.

The sidebar covers pretty much all the fundamentals that we must go out and practice through execution, but it is not a play by play. It is not a step by step instruction manual on what to do, and this is what frustrates people going through rage even more. And the younger and less based the person is, the worse and chaotic his rage will be. Let me explain why.

The blue pilled betas can actually teach us something. Their life's goal is to succeed in this world. Have a ""stable"" career, have ""retirement"" savings, have a ""normal"" family, raise ""normal"" kids, etc. They want that blue pilled life dream, even if they have to work their ass off for it. They are WILLING (even if brainwashed) into giving up their lives to build this ""stable"" world around them. Sure there are always exceptions to this rule, but at least the more traditional men, will be chasing a stable career in medicine or engineering or something. This makes them at least well based in their own life. Even if they go through a divorce and realize how blue pilled they are, red pill rage will last a shorter amount of time for them, because they already have a financial and educational foundation. They have a resume, they just have to start their social/sexual life over, which, thanks to the sidebar, is as simple as going out into the real world and fucking up repeatedly until you get the hang of it (not really but you get the gist).

A young man in his late teens or early college years who finds the red pill, and realizes why his young sexual life is absolute garbage, will have severe rage. This is because he has no existing foundation. He hasn't had a marriage/relationship that is long enough to give him some experience. He doesn't have the finances to be able to just move to a new city and start over. He doesn't have a ""successful"" resume. He goes into full panic mode, and eventually, just gives up. He knows he needs to get his shit together, but on top of his obligations to get his financial and practical life together, he is now bombarded with information on how to fix his still not fully developed sexual life.

Again, there are plenty of exceptions to the rules. I have seen young men who found the red pill and immediately saw the mountain they must climb and proceeded to hatch multiple plans on how to do so. Others...fell into depression cursing the world they live in and becoming more reliant on spoon fed step by step instructions on how to proceed. This dependence on a play by play must be broken.

So here I will leave some recommendations as to what to do if you find yourself in this situation. This is not a step by step instruction booklet. These are tips that will explain what you are feeling, why, and where to go.

1. You are mad at women for being the way they are. Okay, and? Screw them. Focus on yourself and your individual happiness and satisfaction (in moderation) as well as making sure you have a solid foundation financially and educationally.
2. ""Everything we do is just to get laid, what is the point?!"" This is where you need to change your mindset. Getting laid is a PERK of having a solid foundation as a MAN. Be a man first, slay pussy later. You need to understand that you do not revolve around women, they revolve around you. You must become a magnet, not be attracted to one. A magnet has scientific properties that make it attract all sorts of metals. IRL this is: Money, fame, good looks, reputation, success, status, masculine alpha behavior/mentality, an IDGAF mentality for sure. Magnets do not fucking care what you are, if you're within range, you will be attracted.
3. You feel like you know more than the men around you so now you are acting petty and posting on your instagram story about how ""women suck and man up and etc"". Stop. Just stop. You are just like everyone else, we are just like you. We are all in the same boat, you are not special, and just because you know something someone else doesn't, doesn't mean you are better. Also, stop putting red pill stuff you read online on your instabooks, you will alienate anyone who sees it. Just get off social media period, stop texting women and being their little bitch, go to #1 on this list, go make your base. No not a pillow fort. A base, somewhere you live, somewhere you can go to when shit hits the fan and start over. 

**Conclusion**

Remember at least one thing from all of this: This is not an over night change. This will take years. Just like the gym wont turn you into the rock over night, reading trp content and practicing it wont make you an alpha over night. I know I am far from where I want to be, but I want to try, and I will try. So go cool off from the rage, accept the world as it is, and learn to use it to your advantage.",1

Yes it's a load of shit, but this is how they justify it.

I think this is also why they're so hostile to the idea of people even on this sub even talking about women abusing men because it makes them uncomfortable.

Feel free to use it if you want lol",0
6385,6386,"People assume any approach is a sexual approach because it's no longer common to have casual friendsApparently a portion of people below the age of 30 think a man inviting a woman over for a drink is a form of sexual harassment. And this mentality appears to have spread to many fields of daily life; if anyone talks to me it's because they want to fuck me.

And I thought, why do people think like this now? This idea that if anyone of the opposite sex interacts with you there's a high chance they're just interested in getting you to bed.

It's technology and the rise of voluntary self-isolation. That's the cause. Over the past 30 years people in developed countries have learned to spend more time connected to their electronic devices than actually talking to others in bars, cafes, etc. How many people of the overall population spend 3 hours a day chatting with friends, neighbors, coworkers and acquaintances in person? And how many spend 3 hours a day browsing the internet?

Even mundane things like talking with your neighbors or trying to spark a conversation at a bus stop. People, especially younger people, just prefer to stick to their phone, and doing otherwise is often seen as an awkward attempt to converse with a complete stranger. Many folks don't even consider the idea because they have no interest in talking to people around them at all.

[A study by YouGov found that people below the age of 25 had the fewest friends and the fewest acquaintances](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/07/30/loneliness-friendship-new-friends-poll-survey), meaning they're lonelier than people of older age groups. Every new generation appears to do worse in this aspect so it is safe to assume the generation younger than this one, Generation Z or ""Zoomers"", will be even lonelier. And this definitely has been influenced, very likely to a high degree, maybe even directly caused, by the raise of personal devices.

Having friends of the opposite sex that you have no interest in dating or having sex with has become such a rare situation that most people don't even consider that scenario as a possibility. Everyone assumes that if a man shows interest in a woman or if a woman shows interest in a man there must be, by necessity, some sexual interest between the two of them.

In fact, this even affects people of the same sex. It is becoming more and more difficult to present [male friendships without people assuming the dudes are gay inside](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/42/51/bb4251056186c8c04dc36e8a76ce0f97.jpg), to the point where folks [insist that two cartoon characters are gay simply to pitch them together](https://www.thegamer.com/stop-lying-nintendo-cj-and-flick-are-gay/). I have seen this among my friends, both women and men: every time two guys show any more affection than a fist bump or a high five several people comment if they're bi or not. My friends laughed at the 1917 movie because for them two guys being friends during war is definitely a sign they're gay.

EDIT: This has even affected soooo many comics characters like Wolverine and freaking everyone. You have a social outcast, a depressed loner, a dude from another era who has seen all his friends die and hates himself and struggles to even get by and one day he manages to make a friend despite the brutal depression, like Nightcrawler or Bucky or whatever, and they hang out and tell each other their insecurities and drink beer together and... It's wholesome, they finally made exactly what they needed: a friend. And then a gay writer comes along and goes ""This is going to be sexual now, this is now driven by sexual interests instead of friendship or camaraderie. I know it's toxic to sexualize and romanticize depression and suicidal thoughts, but you know what these characters need? Gay sex.""

**Despite the social isolation** and the raise of friendlessness, there is one aspect of life that can never be satisfied without physical contact: sex. People have become less likely to go out to make friends, but more likely to go out to get laid. The impulse to have sex still drives people to talk to strangers and younger generations have become more open about casual sex and approaching strangers with the clear intent of fucking.

As a result of this, if you get approached by a stranger in public, the chances of them wanting to be your friend are lower than ever before in history and at the same time the chances of them wanting to bang you are highest than ever before.

**Change My View**: People assume the worst of any interaction because wanting to make friends has become less common than ever but openly wanting to fuck has become more common than ever.",0

6395,6396,"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 12, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

**The Break:**

I took a break from the sub for a while. It was recommended by more experienced guys. I couldn't see it at the time but I was clinging to MRP like a life buoy.

**Mindset:**

I am confident that the work that I am doing is compounding. I can see how I celebrate too early. Instead I will use those times to recalibrate. There is some learned helplessness masked by distractions that I need to deal with.

# MAP

**Physical:**

The home workouts are going well. I will work faster at the gym when it reopens. I will use current frustration to fuel more workouts.

**Money and Material Wealth:**

The work I was doing before the pandemic is steady. It is more demanding. I will systemise more and dedicate the time to new opportunities. That is what I am going to focus on for the rest of the month of May.

My best cash ooportunity is via my creativity. I will set up sales channels for this with the time gained from routinisation.

I am a maker. I can make and manage production teams. The review and reorientation process is my least favorite. This because it doesnt feel like making. This effects my earnings and options. I need to incorporate improvement in these phases into my money and management systems.

**Comfort:**

The comfort I gave myself recently is a few drinks at the weekend. What I am masking is dissatisfaction. I have cut out the weekend drinking to force myself to define what I want more specifically.

There is resentment in the lack of looking after myself first. Previously I have either over battled or bailed. Again the need for calibration raises it head.

HOA made a comment to the effect You cant create for someone what you havent created for yourself. Well...you can. But it is not good. Weve a saying where Im from, The cobblers children go barefoot. Enough of this.

To be congruent you have to build your frame for yourself, not on the promise of favorable outcomes. 


**DHV:**

I was advising on National projects for my countrys response to Covid-19 this coupled with my busy work life, home workout and OYSing has taken on an extra positive halo during the 'crisis'. As the kids say, Im glowed up. But its because of the theatre lights.

This adds to dread. Her compliance is increasing and harpiness is decreasing. The current situation is demonstrating to my family and network that I prepared for this type of work reshuffle for years.

This is resulting in more efforts to keep me and some shitty comfort tests. I have reread some of J10's posts on Shitty Comfort Tests and managed them accordingly. 

I have some residual resentment about AWALT. I will channel this in lifting. And into reflecting on my personality and preferences.

In addition I have been coasting in the sunlight that comes from not being an autist during a pandemic. 

It's time to up my game and take advantage of the free roll Covid has given many of us.


**Personality and Preference:**

This is emerging more. I am making the space to express my preferences by better planning and taking the time to reflect. 

**Sex:**

The sex is always there. I get it when I want it. It's enthusiastic. I'm not here for that anymore. 

There are things I would like to try in bed but it's not a priority. More precisely, its note a priority with my wife in her current body shape. Her tits look great and BJ performance has improved through more nuance and demonstrable hunger. 

The only game i am running is asshole game combined with push/pull and healthy doses of stfu. It works fine at the moment. I could add kino. 

Oneitis is dead but willingness to Nuke the Nuclear Family isnt in play yet. I could do it but would I? 

Early in this process I would have said yes, but anger would have been the fuel. I may say 'yes' again soon and improved preparedness will be the gate to that transition.",0

###Financial

...

###Professional

###Social

I deleted the dating apps, too much temptation for quick validation when I'm bored at work.

I have built a schedule for my time.

I'll be spending 3 dates a week discovering and working on my covert contracts, maintaining boundaries, Game, Kino, initiation, OI, passing shit and comfort tests from 3+ ""different"" women who all know I'm seeing other women, and developing and maintaining the beginnings of my Frame. 

###Mental

I couldn't figure out a way to make the leap to internal abundance (non-external based) when it comes to my value to women while sitting in my house being in my own head.

Plating was absolutely about seeking external validation at the start and still is to a certain extent, ""proof of concept"" for myself, and I made an extremely risky move that I'm still fighting my way through internally... I could become addicted to the external validation (I'm still working to understand, minimize, and regulate my *desire to be desired* vs having the proper mental model of ""assumed desire"" - *of course they desire me - because I have high value as a Red Pilled man who owns his shit - this one is lucky I'm deciding to gift her with my time and attention*, it is extremely easy to be on the wrong side of that line, or lie to yourself about which side of it you're on) 

I won't blame anyone but myself if shit hits the fan because of my choices. 

I've made some progress already, but not the full on critical leaps that are necessary to never need this kind of external proof again. 

I had the internal realization that women's value of me isn't a worthy measurement of my value, not even this small part of my value, nor is it an accurate one. This is why it is so important to be my own judge in all things.

My mental state has quickly arrived at the fact that plating women can't be a mission, not even a side mission, its basically a distraction at best - a ""hobby of interest"" to pass time enjoyably and help one relax after a day spent living a fulfilling life. 

Women (single women especially) are all desperate to connect to a man who doesn't enervate them, and offers escape from their shitty, lonely existence. AWALT. J10 and u/HornsOfApathy put it well, and as I've been going on dates with these women over the last month while mostly Larping Alfa, the truth of that is crystal clear. The better I embodied that energizing HVM who could offer ""The Great Escape"", the better my dates went. Having an attitude and outlook absolutely overflowing with positivity and life energy (""Abundance"") was extremely attractive to them, whether in a high or low energy environment. 

I'm not that guy yet, but I'm not exactly Larping him either. He's in me, got buried alive for a while, and I just have to keep helping him grow to become an automatic part of who I am. 

J10 talked about a hot tub soak. One of my plates has a nice deep tub in her room connected to a standing shower (hers is the master in the house), so after we fucked this last time, I spontaneously had the desire to try it out. As a reward for her, I let her join me for the bubble hot soak. I had her sitting in my lap in the tub, both of us laid back, just relaxing and talking and joking about nothing important. She commented that she ""didn't think it would be this nice"" just to take a bath together. The time I spent at her place was less than 3 hours total, yet that *escape* was there, and was tied to having great sex with me. She was asking before I left if I could stay over, and when she could see me again. The next time she started the bath herself and asked me in.

This is like a different kind of dynamite, and I need to treat it with the same care.

I hadn't reread HOA's and J10's words prior to reflecting on this week in at least 4 months, and everything I've been doing with this chick and the other 2 has been almost 100% on instinct, very little thinking, so something somewhere must be clicking... the experiences I've had reminded me of their words. Good to reread them and remember what I'm working towards as a starting point for an eventual LTR if one of them vets properly, although not likely.

Fuck me... just reread the other parts of HOA's ""Great Escape"" and a staple of what I've been telling my plates from the very beginning is that I don't judge them, I only judge myself.

""No Judgement, No Expectations."" 

This is basically my catchphrase at this point whenever they tell me some shit they're nervous about sharing because its personal or they give me the cues that they're scared I'm going to ""run away"" because they have faults or whatever. Teaching them that their shit doesn't bother me or affect why I'm spending time with them, I'll just listen and thats it. 

I better go reread the Fundamentals of Frame posts because these plates are about to do a trust-fall straight through my ""Frame"" and its not going to be pretty if I'm not prepared to hold them in my Frame and they end up hitting the ground. I need to not be a cardboard cutout basically. Its well past time to be a man in more than words.",0
6398,6399,"###Marriage

STBX is having car issues. Keeps dying in random places because she hasn't gotten proper maintenance done on it.

I need to reflect on why her negligence with her car maintenance makes me angry... it doesn't put the kids in danger really, just inconvenience and embarrass them and me (at least according to my feelings, and I don't want to make decisions based on that)

After reflection I've come to the conclusion that (as usual for me) it stems from my lack of control of the situation. I can't force or coerse STBX to live her life better, and yet she still has an impact on my children in very real and tangible ways. She is their female role model, and I don't like what she models a lot of the time. 

That said, I need to focus on my own shit before calling the kettle black. 

I made the appointment for the car and drove her to the bank to get her money. (Her car was fully nonfunctional at this point) Hopefully this puts an end to it IRL, but either way it was another opportunity for me to see inside myself and fix a fucked up thought/feeling.

###Family

STFU continues to be a critical part of my life, for a Different reason than most guys here. As previously covered, I rent the second floor of my parent's large home. Large enough that the space over the garage is now STBX's ""apartment"" with me just using the kitchen and laundry, and the space over the rest of the house is ""my apartment"" where I spend the majority of my time when I'm actually home. 

My parents obviously know that I'm out late several nights a week and for a chunk here and there on weekends, and while my step dad hasn't said anything, my mother has been probing and pressuring consistently. I've taken this as an important part of my growth program, because a large part of my BP conditioning and Nice Guy tendencies came from being raised by her in my early years as a single mother. Mostly I just STFU and ignore her, and I Fog outside of that. She's even gone overt once ""you're not working or running errands or working out this much, so why don't you take 3yo to play with your *friend's* kids? I'm sure they also have some???"" She's trying to Frame it as me missing time with my 3yo, but I'm doing this my way, and the stage of me being out until 9 almost every night will have been short lived. Like I said a few weeks ago, I always knew that my level of activity to create the plates I have now was not sustainable. Her feelings on this are not important. No one needs to know my inner thoughts, my plans, my weakness or my strength. No one. I am the judge of my own actions and I decide what I will do with my time. 

Had a ""critical moment"" with 3yo this week, from my perspective anyway. Critical more in my evaluation of my own efforts as a parent. Bedtime has been a sore point for me for a long time, and I haven't been consistent here like I have in many other areas of parenting for 3yo.

She had riled herself up to throwing a tantrum with mom, refusing to eat her dinner, despite STBX and my own attempts to de-escalate and distract her and get her to listen to us both. She was warned by both me and STBX many times that if she didn't stop, it would be early bed time with daddy. She kept going intentionally, gauging us both. So I took her to bed in my part of the house, spent about 15 minutes patiently but firmly leading her to calm down and stop the crying and screaming and such, then explaining what a consequence is and why she needs to listen to mom and dad, and staying firm through her varied techniques and attempts at getting me to cave and let her go back and finish eating her dinner in the noisy lit up part of the house. She finally fell asleep, and so did I, but even just a week or two ago I would have gotten frustrated that she always wants to be with mom where the screens are always on, and I would have taken her back to STBX and told her to deal with it. This time, while I am still unhappy with how STBX runs her end of bedtimes and continue to express this in the form of suggestions when 3yo is misbehaving, I didn't take my 3yo expressing this preference repeatedly as a personal offense and was amused by it instead - I had empathy for my 3yo and realized if I were in her shoes, I'd prefer mom too (little/no restrictions, stay up late every night, get away with a lot, tablet all the time to keep me out of mom's hair, etc) - but also I understand that as her father it is important for me to be consistent and follow through on things I tell her I am going to do, and teach her to live a life of integrity. I also want to model the type of man she should look for in her adult life, and a HVM doesn't let the mood swings of a toddler get the best of him

Queued: Finishing The Six Pillars of Self Esteem

I haven't posted for a month. Classic ego-driven, I don't need this shit, it's dragging me down thinking. I'm incapable of holding myself to account at this point, even without you guys 'dragging me down' and I can see I'm a few weeks from never posting again so it's time to get back at it before it's too late.

I'm vaping and drinking more than ever. I'm being a total weak-ass shit about this. It's bugging me endlessly and I can't seem to find the will to make a serious effort just for me. Why bother with anything if I can't do the real basic shit? I won't drink this week (with a target of at least four weeks) and I will stop vaping as soon as I post this. It's a shame I can only do it to please a bunch of strangers on the internet, but it worked last time and I won't go back again. Pathetic whichever way you look at it but I'll take it.

These failures lead easily to lots of thinking about what I want in life, what my purpose and mission is, am I simply content to be billy beta and the plough horse. Despite what I might think consciously, deep down I don't think I believe in myself or that I have value or I can do better or deserve it.

I do have the power to change that and my 'pleasure' seeking and self-sabotaging ways but it's going to take a long time, I ain't no Horns. I'll use the reality this place presents, as unpleasant as it can be, as best I can.

Lock-down is working in my favour and will for a couple more months. I'm saving lots of time and money, my weight is down a couple of Kg, I'm almost hitting 50% protein, I'm eating almost no junk.

Physically I feel like shit and exercise is a struggle. I'm weak and the causes are clear because it isn't sleep or diet. I finally really, really accepted I'm skinny fat, hence the good work on the diet. Ditto on being weak, first steps there are the vaping and drinking and simply not having a day off from doing something and sucking up the soreness.

Relationships are good, surprisingly so considering lockdown, but I won't fool myself I still don't have a ton of work to do, especially when it comes to application rather than knowledge.",0

Re Porn: I have noticed my fantasies are more erotic and less extreme. I think the porn was having a negative effect on me that I didnt notice and moving me away from what was erotic and felt good to just high stimulus. I enjoy it sometimes but Im not sure how to integrate that into my life without having the negative effects, maybe I cant?

**Separation:**

I am scared of letting go in case I regret it. I was holding onto the relationships and that was driving a lot of the negative thought patterns. I havent let go fully yet but Im feeling a lot less guilt/responsibility for her emotions. I am still feeling some and it is changing my behavior but I feel like Im making progress here.

Struggling with frustration ex's ongoing shit. She is adversarial and it's only negative on our daughter. She accuses me of shit that isn't true, attacks me for no reason and blames me for everything negative. I have been trying a few different ways of dealing with it but the more she realizes I'm not coming back, the worse it gets.

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

I feel like Im rehashing the same shit and not fully internalizing it. Academically understanding something but not able to integrate it into my life. Probably just need time and to pay attendant to the progress I am making. Also, I keep worrying someone on MRP will call me out for not making enough progress. That is outside my locus of control and not something I should worry about but really Im worried because I dont feel like Im making enough progress. Hence my plan to revisit the progress I am making.

u/BarracudaRP post, helped me understand why I feel simultaneously like Im faking it and authentic, also he articulated a thought I hadnt been able to which is that that Im doing this to save myself not because its authentically me. Im still driven by wanting to change myself, which considering what Im like is probably a good thing for now.

*Mood*  still low mood more than I would like, I had about two weeks where I was feeling good, I am still consistently feeling much better than I was and I think this will improve. Today I was feeling bad and thinking about how I would post it here and someone would save me, somehow make it better. Then I just let myself feel bad, I didnt have to do anything with that emotion. I felt immediate much better and free, I still dont feel great today but that letting go of needing to fix it and of the caretaking was a big improvement. Links into below:

*Feelings covert contract*  last week u/Blarg_Risen pointed out that Im not depressed but that I have (among other things) a covert contract around feeling sad. I have been thinking a lot about this and was playing out a skit in my head when I saw just how deep the covert contract is:

I was at my Dads grave and was sad

* My partner (who I dont even have in real life) in this skit came up and hugged me/supported me  took care of me
* I realized the emotion I was imagining was more about eliciting a care response from her than actual sadness and I realized how far I have come from freely expressing myself. I need others validation for my emotions so much more deeply than I thought.
* Then I thought about expressing my sadness without trying to elicit a response from anybody and that felt freeing.
* Then I got to the bit Im struggling with, I want to be able to express my authentic emotions around others and I do want them to hear them in an appropriate way (e.g. not laugh) and to connect over this. Im not sure how I get to this point, is it somewhere I can get to?

*Point of origin*  Im still trying to be happy by making life good rather than me good. Every now and again I feel like my life can be whatever I make it and that feels awesome. This can very easily turn to the Shame ->overwhelm cycle below.

I have a strong through pattern of me not meeting my own expectations -> shame -> overwhelm -> give up/seek caretaking. Comparing myself to others very often triggers this.

Im slowly starting to see emotions are independent of any reactions to the issue. E.g. I was having some emotion about my dad (missing him) then I thought I should do what would make him proud this is the first time (I think) that I have caught myself in this. I realized that my missing him was completely separate to my actions and that I want to make myself proud, separate to that, I miss him.

I still want someone to love me, Im still scared of being alone, I dont think Ill be ok with bad emotions etc.

**Misc.**

Currently Im living at my moms house, the lawyer has advised I stay here until custody is settled as it gives us several advantages and preempts any false accusations from ex. The house is on a corner and basically subdivided with an entry on each street, if I did a few things it would be subdivided. I am considering staying in the other house for 1-2 years after the custody is sorted as it would be good for my daughter and save me time and money (I would still pay rent but cheaper than I could get something equivalent for), if I rented something else I would have to move to a cheaper area and it would be further away from daughters childcare/ex etc. Objectively living there would help me move towards my goals but Im feeling resistance toward it. Im currently reading the monogamous to your mom chapter of NMMNG and I dont think its that as she doesnt try and leech any emotions, doesnt over step boundaries and just generally that chapter didnt resonate with me either time I read it (defense mechanism?). I think its because I imagine bringing girls back and Im living next door to my mom but why do I give a shit what they think? If I was advising a friend I would say, live there, make progress towards your goals and when you have achieved xyz (I have some specific ones in mind) then you will have the money to afford a place where you want. Who gives a shit what other people think, but Im not advising a friend and I cant separate the issues in my head here.",0
6402,6403,"**Breaking Free Activity 18**: Identify a gift you initially resisted, any gifts you need to surrender to right now. 

Initially: basically all failure/hardship. Ray Dalio said pain + reflection = growth. Friends in high school, trial, etc. Many things I can think of. 

Now: Ex shitiness, this is an opportunity for me to practice and grow so I can become the man I want to be and have what I want in my life.  

**Breaking Free Activity 19:** One area where you routinely feel frustrated or out of control. Are you trying to project the reality you want onto the situation? If you had to accept the reality of this situation, how might you change your response to it?

Relationships/women  I want the bluepill fantasy, I want to life happily ever after, I want there to be something more than survival of the fittest. If I had to accept this, which Im currently trying to do, I would treat online dating as marketing, I would accept I wont be loved like that but that I dont need to be and accept there is no relationships destination where I can relax and just be me. 

Separation  Im still having a hard time accepting this, it ties into the above, Im holding onto the blue pill fantasy and ignoring reality. The reality is, she did thinks regularly that crossed my boundaries, I let her from the start and doesnt offer that much in a relationship. If I accepted all this then I would let go and move on, acknowledge my tendency to only remember the good and remind myself of the bad, accept that I might have been able to make it work had I been less of a faggot but its too late now. 

Life  I want there to be a meaning to life but I know there is only the meaning you make. It feels pointless that we just life to reproduce and die, I want there to be something more. If I accepted this I would do more of what I want, for me, not some false obligation to society or anybody else. I would care less what they thought of me, angry selfish, whatever the accusations, I would just life for me and what I want. 

Daughter  I have fear that Ill lose her somehow, death, ex stopping my access etc. And I might. If I accepted this I would have less anxiety. 

**Breaking Free Activity 20**  guidelines for feelings. 

Read, try to keep in mind. 

Some comments, feelings are separate to the issue, I make them one and the same, you can have a feeling with no obligation to do anything and without it meaning anything. I am scared to have feelings, I am scared of having bad feelings that I cant handle and just any feelings but by stopping them I actually feel much worse. I am not even able to feel safe in my own feelings, how is a woman supposed to be safe in me?  

**Breaking Free Activity 21**  list one fear that has been controlling your life. Use affirmations I can handle it, no matter what happens, I will handle it until you take actions and stop feeling fear. 

* Moving on form the separation. 
* My daughter dying. 
* Starting a business.

**Breaking Free Activity 22**  Identify one area that is out of integrity. Identify the fear. 

Truly moving on from ex, I would fantasize about her sexually and indulge fantasys of us getting back together. I would use this to avoid feeling negative feelings about the relationship and family breaking down. I am scared I am making a mistake, that my daughter will suffer as a results, that Ill regret my decision, that I will be alone and not able to have what I want. I think this is being driven by; I dont back myself and I fear exs actions. I still dont have the confidence that I can make my life whatever I want (although I get glimpses of it). 

Fear 2: I fear starting/taking on something big. I am scared it will overwhelm me and Ill quit. That I will fail and be laughed at. As a kid, my family went bankrupt due to a business venture and I think I associate that to trying something myself. Considering my current situation, I think the best plan is to spend a few more months getting my shit sorted and starting something on the side. From there I can reassess.",0

**Physical**

Began the ninth (or tenth?) repeat of the 3-month-long Athlean-X program I bought a couple years ago. It has been money well-spent. Having an ""official program"" that spells out what to do every day is great for discipline, and reviewing the prep videos is always motivational. Also there is enough variety and intensity in it to keep it challenging - except I don't get the same variety with just home equipment. Next week we're told gyms open! I've also finished my first run thru the Core 4 Abs program and restarting it.

As part of getting my blood pressure under control the doc had me quit taking Naproxen. Consequently my joints ache all the time. Let's me know I'm still alive. New diet seems to be helping with weight, though, which is good.

**Work / Financial**

About a month ago just as the lockdown started I was transferred / matrixed to two women. I always ask ""what else do you need? What else should I be doing?"" etc. This week I find out one of them is complaining (not to me, of course) that I'm not doing what she wants. I contact her and ask her to tell me which team I should be working with, which of course she doesn't do. So now begins the recovery and ""alignment"" process. More importantly, trying to avoid being fired in this current work climate.

**Mindset**

This work situation is not unusual. There's always some executive somewhere looking for a reason to be upset. The tension is the ""edge"" for consultants. You never want to be too comfortable, you'll miss something. Also you need to continually be ready that any given Friday they can say ""don't come back Monday"". Its happened before and it will happen again. Sort of like the Stoic practice of thinking through the pre-fail or worst outcome as a way to mentally ground yourself.

**Relationship**

This part of my life is great. If I didn't know she had had a complete hysterectomy 25 years ago I'd say she must be ovulating. Extremely aggressive sexually. Sildenifil is my friend.",0

**Shit to own**

*Health:* In his books Pavel Tsatsouline calls the 48kg kettlebell The Beast. In keeping with the tradition, I will call the 12 kilo bell The Pussy. Long story short, I injured my back and switched to The Pussy for this weeks workouts. It happened after waiting in line for a long time with shitty posture reading SGM on my phone. Bad KB swing form could be a contributing factor, or it could be the extreme back flexion required until recently to put my daughter to bed. Constant 4-5 level pain in the very low back near the hips, on the right-hand side, with the occasional flashes of 8-9 when I tried to bend over or get up from bed. Lasted for 2 days and then subsided but did not completely go away. For two days, putting on socks or tying my shoes was a challenge. I pulled out Kettlebell Simple and Sinister, the chapter on hip hinge and proper form with the swing and did all the exercises with The Pussy two-handed. Yesterday did the same, with the 20kg kettlebell. Back felt fine. I decompress the spine by hanging from a bar at least once per day, I do hamstring stretches and try to avoid flexion of the spine as much as possible. I might even go to the doctor as an extreme measure, if all else fails. 

Gyms will maybe open later this week. If so, I will do the first barbell workout this weekend and keep it light. 

Key takeaway: Im dealing with the back pain without being a miserable whining pussy, esp. with the wife.

*Relationship (contains action item from last week):* So I play this game where I initiate at least two times per week and I win if my initiation was good according to me. Actually, its according to my dick  if it gets hard, the initiation was good. I continue to watch out for diminutive words and Im being successful like 80% of the time. 

By above mentioned measure I did one low quality initiation and one high quality, both did not result in sex because the wife was tired or something. But the sexual pressure got to her so during the say she started giving me IOIs and coming to me for a kiss and an ass grab and eventually initiated sex herself. It was exactly like my standard Nice Guy initiations, only with the roles reversed: I asked her for a back rub because my back was sore, she gave me a good enough back rub and then started escalating with kisses all over my back and shoulders, getting naked and grinding her pussy on my ass and hips. I threw her down, ate her out, did a quick 69 where she licked my balls and then fucked missionary. Barely managed to last long enough and she came several seconds after me, which means I had to pump away with the post-cum erection. P.S. Sex makes the back pain worse. 

I had so much fun eliminating dimunitive words, I am going start another game  speak slowly, with a strong tone, eliminate verbal bullshit.

Key takeaway #1: at some point I switched from seeking validation from my wife to seeking validation from random Internet faggots. Takeaway #2: I need to improve my Immersion first before focusing on the D, E, or V. Also, jerk off more often so that I can last longer.

*Work (action item from last week):* this week my company returns to the office full time. I stay till late in the office and focus on clearing the to do list.

*Kids:* I am doing a better job of setting boundaries before I lose my shit. I am also keeping cool when my wife loses her shit over the kids misbehaving. She has a much lower threshold than me.

The son wanted me to buy him a new game to play on his Android. Its a gigantic sum of money, around 10 euros. I wanted to buy it and use it as a reward for some desired behavior. I decided it should not be something he is supposed to be doing anyway, so I think I found the perfect solution: the son now has to demonstrate to me and the wife how he plays the free version of the game and stops playing when we tell him to stop. I told him  in order to buy you a good video game I want to see that you are able to control your addiction. We use the words phone sickness with him.

*Thoughts on SGM:* the #1 thing Ill remember from SGM it the notion that women need sex more than men. It may or may not be true, but its a great frame to adopt when dealing with the wife, as in: I am giving her the gift of fucking.

**Goals till May 19th  next week**

 New: Eliminate verbal bullshit, speak slowly and deliberately

 Get back to 15% BF or below <-- getting there

 Keep initiating and DNGF <-- going OK so far

 start one of the game books (Day Bang?) and try out stuff on the wife <-- might have to postpone the deadline

**Mission/ long-term stuff**

 Stop giving a fuck what others think, switch to internal validation

 Become a high energy charismatic guy. Prioritize my career and be successful in my current role, which is essentially running a business within the company

we should bring that back since it seems is needed at this point.",0
6423,6424,"The old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off, because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics. 

Singularly, a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow. They might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief. But even then, they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of ""no innocents"" or at least, no touching those within their own communities. 

Then, as more of these organizations formed, they started getting more powerful. Forming alliances, making enemies of each other. 

Then drugs became a huge part of it, and a lot of the rules went out the window. 

Sometime during the 60s and 70s, when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs, they basically were at odds with gov entities, kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems. Their power wasn't really equal, but it was enough to be a threat. 

Where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did. 

It was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections, and that goes back even into the early days. 

If a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money, and ""reminded"" you that your business, and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate.... That probably meant that if that candidate lost, there would be repercussions. So those businesses needed to coerce their employees, their unions, etc., through whatever means, to vote a certain way. 

Well.... once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole, they have lose their usefulness in that regard, which is why they basically went extinct. 

I mean, sure... There are still shady organized crime rings, but it's mostly cartel linked stuff now. Nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day. All of that stuff more or less dissipated. 

They all either went to prison, died off, or went into politics. 

The same families, the same money, the same old power structures still exist somewhat... They just don't have the same ways of doing business. Now they just operate through political business dealings, big donors, and fundraisers. 

The ""protection money"" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money, assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out... But more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office...

6431,6432,"Guy at my LTRs job is trying fuck herMy LTR of 18 months called me this morning saying she feels guilty. A guy she works with has been flirting with her. She said, she felt bad because she didnt completely negate his sexual behavior and briefly entertained the idea at the time. She has brought him up to me before and she considered him to be one of the few people at work that she could be friendly with, since the place is loaded with overweight, snarky Karens. I asked her if she did anything with him and she said no, which I do believe right now. 

Shes been working at this place for about 3 months and she told me about the guy from the beginning. I sensed it would come to this at some point. I laughed it off and told her oh that must be your work husband. She also told me hes kinda fat and that Im much better looking. If hes working as a nurse, I also know Im more financially stable than him. The guy does know about me and yet he continues to pursue my girl. 

This man has an LTR and a child which he lives with. He told her that his girlfriend would be cool with it if they had a thing on the side and that his gf is also bisexual. I dont know how she responded to him because I didnt take it too seriously when she brought it up. When she told me about it, I said I appreciate your honesty and Im not gonna hold it against you. Is this guy texting you? She said; no he doesnt have my number. Then I said, Ive seen the type of guys that hit on you and Im not worried about any of them lol. She laughed and got slightly offended. My LTR is definitely the type to crave male attention from what I can see and Im sure she was flattered by the fact that this guy pushed up on her. 

My question is, am I going to have to demote this girl to a plate eventually? Is this a major red flag? Whats the likelihood she ends up fucking this dude? Do I have to go down to her job and fight this dude? 

Ive been way too available to this woman for the past 4-5 months. Taking every phone call on her break and spending all my free time with her. Should I start ignoring her calls and distancing myself from her more? I just setup some dating apps and Im beginning to cultivate new leads on girls. Am I overreacting to this whole thing? What do you guys think I should do?",1

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time.

In the past week alone, I went to make a purchase with my LTR. Because she didn't want to meet up one-on-one with a random guy from the internet. Know what happened? After she bought shit from him, he spammed her phone with messages asking if I was her BF, if she was interested, if she wanted to add him on social media, blah, blah, blah. And I was there and she said maybe two words to this man. I handled the transaction. And that was one of two times THIS WEEK something like that happened.

You're looking at this wrong. If you're with an attractive girl, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. Get used to it or start dating uggos. Stop fearing the competition--be above it. If you're with a hot girl, you should ALREADY be above most of the competition. It shouldn't matter. Treat yourself like you're #1.

6493,6494,"Mental bandwith to listen, note body language, AND be flirty?I've got a problem with my metal bandwith. Over text I can be very flirtatious and escalate. Then when I go on the date, knowing this is supposed to lead to a hookup, I fail to escalate and make a move because I am so distracted by actively listening to the conversation and paying attention to body language that we have a fun conversation and that's it. She drops hints, but because my mental bandwidth is maxed out, I can't respond to them in the same way I would over text, when my mental bandwith is hardly being used at all. 

I can only do two things at a time, and here I'm required to do three.

* I listen, but ignore body language to be flirty and make moves, but screw it up because it's unnatural and ill-timed (because I'm not paying attention to body language).
* I pay attention to body language and try to make natural, well-timed moves, but now I can't keep the conversation going and things fall flat.
* I listen and keep the conversation going, and I pay attention to body language, but I'm too overloaded for flirtatiousness to enter my mind. 

One of those three scenarios, most recently the last one, have been *consistently* cockblocking me when  I should be already in. All of my successes have been with extremely high-interest women who forgive those mistakes.

""Practice makes perfect.""

In this case, it doesn't seem that way. In the past 6 months my text flirting has gone through the roof, but in the same period my in-person flirting has gone **nowhere**.

If she's smiling, complying, being suggestive etc. then keep escalating. To me, body language is most important when you're trying to build rapport and get her receptive to you. If she's having a good time with you then escalate. I'm sorry, I don't see the difficulty.",0
6497,6498,">Do you have a hard time reading people, generally?

Yes and no. I've had so many occasions where I read someone as being disinterested when they were interested, or interested when they weren't. So many occasions where they're smiling and complying, saying they had a great time, but then ghost me after the first date. Or I go for a kiss and get rejected. Even online sometimes, we'll be flirting and she'll be suggestive back, then out of nowhere I'm blocked or unmatched. That all makes me feel like I suck at reading people. I can neither trust my gut instinct to read them, nor can I trust them to be giving genuine signals.

6513,6514,"New Mother Needing Advice On CopingHi Red Pill Wives! I'm really in need of some advice in this very trying time of my life. Well, I don't know if I need advice, a slap in the face, a shoulder to cry on, or just to commiserate - I guess I just need some context. My husband and I have been married for a year and a half and we have a 7.5 month old son. I'm really struggling with the transition from purely homemaker to include being a stay-at-home-mom. My husband works a great job and we have always been in agreement that our ideal situation would have me staying at home looking after our children.

I feel like I'm currently not meeting my own expectations or my husband's expectations of what I should be doing at this point. The first few months were absolutely survival, we both knew that going into it, but now that we've found more of a routine with the baby I'm struggling even more now that there's more expectations of me. The idea that there's zero ""time off"" from motherhood is really eating at me in a way I hadn't anticipated.

I end up feeling slightly resentful and come off as ungrateful to my husband when his job ""ends"" and he gets a break in the evenings. He frequently works on things at home (he'll VPN onto work and check things during some evenings and on weekends) so it's not that he only works during the day and lounges for the rest. However, I get up and cover anything that our son needs between bedtime (around 7pm) and I'll get up anywhere between 6-8am and look after him for his first wake-window. Neither of us are morning people, so I find myself envying my husband who gets to stay in bed until 9 or 10. Partially for the sleep, but partially because he gets the opportunity to stay up late to enjoy his hobbies where I feel pressure to get to bed early so I'm not absolutely dead for a 6am wakeup.

We counter this problem once in a while by my husband taking the first wake-up. I'll get up and feed our son and he'll get up and spend an hour or two with him so I can get back to bed. This is usually a great treat but it's not feasible for him to do it super often and I feel a lot of guilt asking him to get up earlier on a work day or after I know he's been up late.

A lot of things I previously enjoyed as a homemaker (cleaning, cooking, general errands) don't bring me joy in the same way now that it's a juggling act with a baby. Even though I really enjoy making food for my husband, I get frustrated and anxious about getting groceries or meal planning and frequently ask if we can get take-out instead, which in turn makes me feel like I'm doing a bad job. I try and stay on top of the laundry and dishes pretty well, but the overall state of our house is not something I'm proud of. 

My husband is an absolutely awesome dad and he's so willing to be involved and help when he can around his work schedule. I honestly love being a mom too, it's just been really hard that I don't feel like I get to be anything but a mom anymore. I'm half and half breastfeeding and pumping (about 4x each per day). If the baby isn't up, I'm usually hooked up to my breastpump, cooking/doing dishes, or doing laundry. I get a couple hours in the evening where I can take part in my hobbies, but by that point I'm usually so exhausted that I crash and get to bed as soon as possible. Any energy for physical intimacy with my husband is almost a distant memory at this point.

Anyways all of this aside I just feel like there's a normal amount of adjustment to being a new parent, but I feel like I'm on the verge of just not coping whatsoever. I'm having multiple breakdowns a month and I feel like I'm putting a lot of extra burden on my husband.  Is it just going to be hard until baby is X months/years old? I feel some added pressure since my husband is facing a possible big promotion where his workload will increase drastically and he won't be able to help as much as he is now. We also want more kids eventually, but I'm barely hanging on with one as it is. 

My husband was speaking to an older work colleague over the phone the other day and they were discussing a conference that was moving to online. They have evening discussions and my husband said that he'd try and be present once our baby was down for the night. The colleague was surprised that I wouldn't be able to handle doing that by myself and asked what I would be doing if he was having to travel and be at conferences in person. That's been eating at me for a little bit ever since it came up. The last couple of times my husband had to travel for work, my parents came to stay with me to help out (we're in the US and they're in Canada, so they've had to cancel all pending travel for the time being).

For those of you that have kids, do you have any tips on how to cope with the big life change? Did I just miss the boat on maternal selflessness that other women figured out before they had kids?",0
6514,6515,"Big hugs! I don't have kids, but I have done a lot of research into this situation, and witnessed it with my friends.

&#x200B;

You've gotta remember, historically, women were NOT alone during this time. Their husbands might be working - but they had neighbors, extended family, and usually older children to help out. You're doing it on your own! Realistically, it's an absolute slog (no matter how much you love it). Can you get some help from your mum or mother in law, or a friend, or a neighbor? Can you hire a babysitter once or twice a week?

&#x200B;

In terms of communicating with your husband: it's okay to tell him that you're struggling with being on-call 24/7. It would feel like your body isn't your own - I know that being 'touched out' is something a lot of mums feel. You need self-care - a bath by yourself, a chance to read a book out of earshot of crying, etc. A good man will understand that!",0
6515,6516,"Full disclosure, I am not the red pill type and stumbled across this post. I am however a mother of two and I feel your struggle so hard. Mine are 8 and 5  and it does get better as they grow and gain some independence. You'll find time more time for yourself and your partner. 

You're breastfeeding and running a household, that's an enormous amount of work and it's a 24/7 job. Feeling like you're a failure or losing yourself is normal, it happens to us all but it's not a part of motherhood that's openly discussed. I do worry about you mentioning frequent breakdowns. Have you been screened for post partum depression or anxiety? Your OBGYN should be able to help. 

For practical advice, find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. I mean for everything. Make a couple of hours a week after the baby is in bed for you and your husband. Take some you time. Even if its getting up fifteen minutes earlier to enjoy a cup of coffee alone. Those alone minutes can be the difference between staying calm and losing your shit entirely. If you're able, hire a babysitter one night a month for a date with hubby. Remember it's okay to ask for help. I waited until my youngest was three to hire a nanny and she's a godsend. Her creativity and input is well worth every penny I've spent and she's become an invaluable part of our family. 

And finally, this to shall pass. All of the struggles you have are temporary and you'll be okay. Your baby will be okay if you're not perfect and so will hubby. Don't compare yourself to other moms or families. You're doing great. 

Also, it's totally okay to hide in the bathroom and cry for a minute when it's overwhelming.",0
6516,6517,"First of all - with all of our kids I was a mess for a year. I had issues with hormones and PPD coupled with not sleeping?  I was an absolute wreck.  My husband took nights on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) so I could actually sleep.  Do you absolutely have to keep pumping? Can you supplement with formula? 

You really need some self care.  There is nothing that says you never get a break just because you are a mom of a baby. In fact you really, really need a break.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  I realize theres a quarantine on and I dont know where you are - but even if you can go get a coffee and sit in the car with a book for 30 minutes.  

The thing is you have a ton of things going on here: you have an infant you is still at an age that is fully dependent on you.  You probably arent sleeping amazing. You are isolated because of a quarantine (along with the stress of that). You are essentially doing this alone (with some help from your husband).  

The infant is a full time job that never ends.  The house and being a homemaker is a full time job.  There isnt much time for leisure and building up your empty stores (you cannot pour from an empty cup).  Figure out what you need.  One day a week of sleeping in?  3 evenings where you can take a bath? Going out to get coffee? Calling a friend?  I cant answer the question for you.  But what you ARE doing isnt working.  Be specific and then tell your husband I really need sleep and I need one full night of sleep a week.  How can we make that happen? Or whatever it is that you need.  YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM FOR NEEDING THIS nor are you a bad wife.  You, my dear, are human.  

If after replenishing your stores you still dont like things that you used to enjoy - please talk to your doctor about it.  You could have Post Partum Depression.  

A couple of books I really like : Replenish by Lisa Byrne 

Say Goodbye to Survival Mode by Crystal Paine

The transition into motherhood is a hard one.  I feel like as a society its supposed to be this 6 week - all the weight is gone, baby is sleeping all night.  Its okay that you arent okay right now.

Edit-cant believe I forgot this! My advice to all new moms (especially if you are struggling!) is to get outside as much as you can.  I realize it may be hard.  But if you can put baby in a stroller or a carrier and got for a short walk that can make a world of difference.  Even just sitting on the porch or a park bench can be very refreshing instead of being stuck inside all day.",0
6517,6518,"It's tough having a baby. It will get better. 

I have made a habit of not working beyond finishing dinner or fixing a quick/easy one and putting said food away. I put the children to bed and I do my best to relax/spend time with my husband. I would start adjusting baby's schedule and yours to align with your husband's. Can you put the child in your room to make things easier? Feed the baby and everyone goes back to sleep. 

Pumping while breastfeeding is quite unpleasant. When I did it, I wanted to just give formula. I would stop pumping unless someone needs to watch your LO while you're away. Has baby started solids? That would be beneficial to you. I loved those yogurt melts for my son. Look into baby-led weaning, so that you don't have to sit there and fight him with a spoon. 

7.5+ months is a perfect time to start playdates. Even if you're the parent hosting or watching the children, you can go somewhere like a child friendly coffee house or park to escape. Children love playing outside, on playgrounds, and with toys they don't have at home, even if they go to see those specific toys weekly. Getting out of the house in general is helpful for one's sanity. 

As far as housework goes. Declutter and minimize possessions! Best thing I've done. I have yet to organize and strategically place everything, but I can totally see how that will only improve our lifestyle at home and cleanliness/tidiness. Ask for help. If you can afford even 1 hour of help a week, it would be worth it. Get into a routine and schedule. With good habits you can do such things as unloading the dishwasher in the few minutes that it takes to make your coffee. Don't be afraid to let your son watch a bit of TV. When he is older, give him chores and tasks to help! 

I agree with the other commenter, as well. You must discuss this with your husband. At the very least he should be respecting your desire to go to sleep earlier. I, personally, find it quite difficult to sleep without mine in the bed with me. Now, his computer is in our bedroom, so the lights and sounds from gaming make it challenging to sleep. If he's up late, so am I.",0
6518,6519,"Please dont be too hard on yourself. I went through the same thing when I had my first baby last year, I felt like I was failing for the first 8 months, it was a difficult transition for me as well. Some days it was a good day if I just managed to get myself dressed. Its not easy at all, but it will get easier. And some days are still like that. Its a tough adjustment. If youre worried about your homemaking and house keeping, I would look into zone cleaning and FLY lady, she has really good tips for beginners. Another good tip is to do something for yourself each day, it will make you a happier wife and mom, sometimes that might just be getting dressed; others it might be doing your hair etc. things will get better!

Men can get away with changing their kids diapers once but god forbid a women hires a nanny or housekeeper. 
Single mother are shunned and laughed at but single fathers are heroes.

6560,6561,FDS Level Up Bitches!,1
6561,6562,"It seems like you're taking on the masculine role since you're the one saving the guy when its usually the other way around.

I looked at your recent comment history and it seems like you are redpilled about the reality of men and how messed up and unfair expectations of women in relationships can be. You wouldn't sacrifice yourself in a relationship like you would in your fantasies. Super interesting.

When our fantasies contradict with our real life views on things drastically it's  a sign of inner conflicts within us.

There are so many reasons you are attached to this fantasy. It makes you feel righteous. It makes you seem very noble and brave. You might like to play this role of protector for your crush because it gives you control over him. He needs you to survive. He is probably in awe of you. There could some narcissism involved. The fact that you're watching over him even after you've passed on can again show a desire for more control over him. And by being able to watch over him like this it's kind of a way to still be with him. Also this way you also avoid the pressures of being in a relationship with him if you somehow saved him without having to sacrifice yourself and he fell in love with you. If you were in a real relationship with him you would have to rely on who you are in your day to day life to keep him interested and not this super woman role and that could be anxiety inducing and it's less exciting and dramatic. That's why you don't like imagining you two together in a normal relationship. Because then you would become more vulnerable.

It also seems like what you want is beyond love. You might not have earned his love but you got his respect. In the end you are unattainable to him even if he wanted to be with you he can't. There's no way he could ever pay you back when you're gone. He will probably think about you in a higher way than his gf. In a pure way you prefer. He might love you in a deeper way than he loves her because you saved him. She could never do that for him. You probably imagine her as being some basic Stacy while you are unique and extraordinary.

It seems like you really hate the focus to ever be on looks and you only want a guy to like you for non sexual related reasons like your altruism and character, Not your looks. You feel degraded when a guy falls for your looks. You want to be loved for non shallow reasons. You might be sexually repressed. You might feel resentful and mistrustful of men in real life.

So many desires and personality and character traits hidden within us come out in our fantasies.

It could be that you resent the gender roles placed on women. Do you find yourself drawn to female characters who are very strong and defy their gender roles? Like Katniss Everdeen? She volunteered as tribute which can be seen as her sacrificing herself for her younger sister.

Did you grow up with a misogynistic or abusive father? Was your father unromantic and ungentlemanlike towards your mother? Like he doesn't open doors for her or bring her surprise gifts? You never saw him show tenderness to her? or that he valued her for anything besides domestic duties? Was your mother a codependent who did so much for her husband but got no equal effort in return? and you would hate to be like her?

Even if you would never act like a codependent in a real relationship with a guy. In your fantasy there's a lot of co dependent traits showing in your character. Her sacrificing herself for a guy she thinks will never be with her can be seen as masochistic and self defeating. She thinks she has to prove herself to this guy by saving him. She doesn't think she has a value outside of what she can do for someone which is what codependents believe. Her motivations are not actually pure. She wants to be praised and admired. She wants control over this guy.

&#x200B;

By contrast do you find yourself being somewhat drawn to and yet cringing at helpless and very weak female characters like Bella Swan from Twilight? But you would never admit to being drawn to twilight in real life because so much of Bella's appeal to the men who love her is because of her feminine traits. Like her scent and her looks and her clumsiness which makes them hyper vigilant in protecting her placing them in the hero role which makes them feel strong and masculine. She doesn't have to do much to keep them interested. Which you might hate and feel disgusted by. You want a guy to value you for things more than just your looks you want them to value you for being powerful and having virtuous characteristics. She doesn't have to save anyone. It's not her noble character that makes the guys go crazy. Do you feel empty and conflicted about love stories like Twilight? Do stories like Twilight make you feel so many different and mostly negative emotions but yet you feel drawn to it? Because at the end Bella got the guy without sacrificing herself for him. She didn't really do anything. She was just pretty and smelled good and got everything most people desire. Love, children, wealth, beauty, immorality and youth.

Playing the conventionally masculine role means you switch the gender roles and you subconsciously might want to seem stronger than a guy because you have internalized misogyny.

These fantasies are actually not unusual. Men have savior fantasies or hero fantasies and no one would be mocking you if you were a man saying this. Don't take it to heart what ignorant people think about this. The more you focus on how embarrassed you are the less you can dig deeper into understanding yourself. Deep down you might feel suppressed in many ways. You should explore that.",1
6562,6563,"Should I send my ex-boyfriends mom a thank you card? If so, how? Would love some help from the RP ladies!As I posted here before, I broke up with my semi-emotionally abusive ex for the final time, and Im determined to make it stick. While he rarely verbally assaulted me (sometimes would call me a bitch), he would constantly criticize me and tell me all the things about myself I needed to change.

I made a list of everything he criticized me more than 3x about. There were 452 list items. One was touches lips to reusable water bottle, and another was wears pink coat that looks childish. He loves playing music and I do not (my mom tried to force me a lot as a kid and it literally makes me panic), and he got into an argument with me for over an hour, trying to make me play piano for/with him. I offered to do ballet (practiced for years as a kid) or write songs to it, but it was no good for him. He threw a tantrum over it once, and locked himself in his room for an hour.

I told him I was sick of him degrading my self-esteem, and to find someone who better fit his needs. If youre wondering why I spent so much time with this guy, its because I have low self-esteem, and because it got especially bad over the last six months. 

In addition, my little brother developed schizophrenia in October, and he was even more critical of me about stupid things, and it was made worse because, rather than take or accept it, I would get really mad at him and sometimes criticize him back (which I never ever did before.) I know thats not RPW, but it would be things like this: In December, as my little brother got sicker and no medication helped, I began the grieving process. I was crying all the time. He offered to fill up a bath. Sounds nice, right? Well, I accidentally drained it and didnt notice because I was crying over my little brother losing his future (which had looked so bright), and he came up to yell at me and put me down for that. I ended up breaking down crying.

So. Not a good relationship. Learned many things and am working on my self-esteem before I get into a new one, otherwise Ill just end up with the same kind of Bad Captain.

I got home today and found two cards with gifts from his sister and mom. 

I knew they would send graduation gifts, so I bought each of them a $25 gift card to  a coffee shop and a store they like, respectively, and sent it to them as a sweet gift. I had hoped that would be taken as a thank-you, but because they were so close to Mothers Day, Im not sure.

Should I send them a thank you note? I want to be no contact with the guy, Im so serious about ending it, but I dont want to be rude.

If so, how do I do it?

More background: The mom and I had a close relationship (she was really excited about me getting married/becoming a mom and that I was with him), while the sister was more like him (shes a GREAT wife and mother, but is not very friendly/personable. She and him would sometimes put my down together.)",1

A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners.  Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 

2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play 

One of those factors, sadly, are looks. 
And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or  if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good. 

3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok.  it can be used as a form of endearment. 

You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about. 

4. NOTHING BEATS BEING GENUINE

Regardless if youre quirky or weird, or whatever else, there will be someone who will match or even compliment that and appreciate you for that. BUT  dont fuck it up by acting the way some of these posts are telling you to act like. 

Also you might think youre a nice guy...but if youre posting here and believing some of these Ill written advices...youre probably not as nice of a guy as you think.",1

THINKING you're ugly is vastly different from actually BEING ugly. It doesn't matter that they may perceive themselves as ugly, we do not share the same experiences and they have no right to infiltrate one of the few spaces genuinely ugly people have. Ugly women in real life have no voice. Normies are committed to ensuring that we don't have a voice online either by stealing spaces meant for us, then having the AUDACITY to expect us to have sympathy for them because :( they're insecure :(. They should not be here and it's not my responsibility to coddle normal or attractive people with low self-esteem.",1
6566,6567,"Yes. I mean, given an example:

Racist white women will always called out before racist white men

This isn't to say that it's not warranted contempt for white women's racism, it's to point out the fact that we hold them far more accountable than we hold the male counterpoint.

And, very often, men will use this as a sort of ""justified misogyny""-- hence white boys clinging to Karen and throwing it any woman who disagrees with them.",1
