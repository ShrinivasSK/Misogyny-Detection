Im not saying women have it better or worse than me, just that reproduction is a particularly difficult aspect. Menstruated cycles and pregnancy already hurt women. Birth control hurts women even more. 

So hopefully by talking about male birth control, starting a conversation, debunking myths, reporting statistics and facts, we can facilitate a safe environment where men can learn/talk about birth control, see the pain that women bear, and can normalise taking responsibility in a completely safe and healthy way.create a safe environment where taking some responsibility doesnt mean hurting yourself in the process",0

If your girlfriend has an abortion and you did not want to be in a relationship with someone who would get an abortion, you did not ask the right questions and get honest responses before having sex. Maybe make sure the person you want to be in a relationship shares your values and goals BEFORE undertaking the act that creates children.",0

3619,3620,"You need to do some more research on your evo-bio/evo-psyc.  Unlike most mammals human women have concealed estrus.  That's because back in the day men and women weren't polygamous and free like you think.  The women were using sex with alphas to procreate (during that hidden ovulation) and trading sex with betas in exchange for resources, favors, assistance with her existing children, etc during the times in her cycle she was unlikely to get pregnant.  Pre-ag revolution most females procreated yet the majority of men did not.

&nbsp;

""Betas"" have **never** been the prize for women.  They've **always** been who they settle for after they've had their fun with the alphas and couldn't lock one down, or who they've used to extract resources in exchange for trickle sex.

6169,6170,"You are 20 and your SO is 24, which means he was about 22 when you met and started dating. It is rare that men are dating for marriage at that age. It is unlikely that he is dating you with marriage in mind. 

I was a couple of years older than you when I met my husband, who was in his late 20s at the time. We were both dating for marriage and moved in together after only 6 months and were engaged in less than a year and married less than a year after that. 

Very, very little has changed from the time we started living together and now as far as how we act. There is very little distinction between girlfriend and wife. For most women, the only distinction is allowing the government into your relationship through legal marriage. For some women, it may also mean engaging in physical activity outside of hand holding and side hugs. 

Here, I think the real issue is that your SO is not old enough to truly be prepared for marriage. At your age, relationships tend to take much longer before marriage.  Among my husbands friends, those who met their partners in their early 20s took nearly a decade to propose. In contrast, those who met in their partners in their late 20s and early 30s were ready to commit to marriage in 6-12 months.",0

723,724,"My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.

It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.

The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". 

Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. 

I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.

TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",1

3388,3389,"Your body count is quite low. The truth, it's about your physical attractiveness. Guys that seemingly do not have issues with getting women do not need to study seduction or any strategy, why is that? It's because there are a lot of women who enjoy what they are looking at, just like you enjoy what you are looking at when you date someone. 

I don't know why it is that men think just because you have a good job, average in physical appearance and understand some strategy that they should be able to hook up with a woman. It doesn't work like this.. 

Would you date a women who was a 2 in looks but had a great job? Why would a woman want to do that then?...  

You likely have adequate exposure already, it's just that women don't seem to be drawn to you. No psychological strategy is going to work here. If you can humbly admit, that you are probably not the dream guy she has in mind when she thinks of being approached by a male, then you have a shot here. 

You know what women want. The want a good looking guy. Do whatever you need to do to be a good looking guy.

3554,3555,"How do I become more receptive to feminism? I hope this question makes sense, but just a short explanation of what I mean.

I'm a guy in my early twenties, I'm going to university, and I've been trying to change recently, so I also started reading up on feminism. Now, I've always been generally left-wing, but when I read a feminist critique for example, I sometimes become quite dismissive. What I mean but that is that I think things like:

""That's ridiculous/not true""

""Oh, so that's a problem too?""

""Seems like everything is an issue""

But when I think about the points, I was so eager to dismiss, some more, I'm more open to them and usually understand where they're coming from. However, that first impulse is really weird. It's sort of like I'm realising that I've been benefitting from some of the problems women face in society, simply because of how society is set up, and my brain doesn't want to admit that because it's easier for me to ignore everything and act like I've done nothing wrong and that everything is fine and dandy?

I still think its wrong, but now I can understand the snap response. Its such an ugly, malevolent word, rarely ever spoken outside of its use to convey utter contempt for another race of human beings. 

But it conveys so much more about the speaker using it in an effort to hurt others than it does those others. It marks a lack of restraint, personal weakness, and little forethought. It marks immaturity for succumbing to that tempting anonymous release of racial hatred. Its a word used by unthinking bumpkins and yokels to mark themselves as such.

Either way, I was not looking seriously, didnt message anybody etc but thought if I do want to fuck a hot 19year old this might be an easy way and it was part of the validation experiment. I found myself falling much more into the validation or insecurity trap than I had with tinder. I was thinking things like; Im not successful/good enough for her, I dont have anything to offer and was thinking how I could position myself to be more what they wanted. Im not sure what the difference is with this or tinder. Im not sure if its validation or insecurity that driving this thinking. Not in a I want x outcome and therefore should do Y but really I dont give a shit about what anybody thinks, I did give a shit what they think.

**Breaking Free Activity 15:** Identify emotional pukes. 

* Withdraw/sulk 
* Threaten to leave when I dont want to

* Escape fantasys 
* Ruminate and talk about what a shitty person they are
* Get sad/down

**Breaking Free Activity 16:** Put yourself first 

Hard in the circumstances, however I have noticed I consider other people a lot, especially ex in the mediation negotiations. I am just noticing these feelings and what comes up around it. I am trying to do a few more things just because I want to and again, noticing the feelings. 

**Breaking Free Activity 17:** Examples of how you used coping mechanisms in childhood/adult life for a smooth and problem free life. 

I didnt want to do this one but Im very glad I did. 

* Doing it right: In childhood I wasnt naughty I would follow the rules and do what was expected of me. As an adult I have to get things right, I have to do each part of my life correctly. 
* Playing it safe: As above for childhood. As an adult I dont do some of the things I want to do e.g. start a business/NGO, I take the safe and easy path e.g. current career. 
* Anticipating and fixing: as a child I would anticipate what would make teachers happy and do what they wanted rather than what I wanted to do. As an adult, in relationships, I anticipate what they might want and try and fix their problems for them. I feel responsible for other peoples happiness. 
* Trying not to rock the boat: as a child I was meek and quiet, I tried to please others, I never wanted attention on me. As an adults Ill often smooth things over with people particularly in relationships. I want to call someone on their bullshit but I dont to avoid causing problems. 
* Being charming and helpful: childhood  Im not sure if I used this one. Probably the helpful, as an adult fuck I love being helpful. 
* Never a moments problem: childhood basically the same as many of the others. As an adult, I try not to have any needs to avoid causing any problems, anything you want. I remember the first thing I did when I started lurking (fuck I should have just started OYS) was start to have an opinion, yes actually I do want the steak over the chicken for dinner. 
* Using covert contracts: childhood, not entirely sure, I think I used the if Im good, Ill get love and affection reasoning and wont feel abandoned. As an adult I use them all the time, if Im the perfect partner Ill get the love, affection and sex I want. I use them a lot, I try to be something of value to other people and in exchange Ill get their friendship or whatever. Im trying to just be more authentically me, and great if they like it but its ok if they dont too except that secretly its not ok they dont like it, I want them all to like me. 
* Controlling and manipulating: as a child I have vague memories of needing something to be sad about, I couldnt just be sad and ask for affection, I needed a reason. Not sure if that really goes in this category, as an adult I fill the same way. I need to have a reason for wanting or feeling anything. 
* Caretakeing and pleasing: childhood, if I pleased my parents I get love. As an adult, if I take care of everything and pleased my partner, I would get love, affection, admiration, sex and kindness. 
* Withholding information: as a child I remember feeling a lot of shame and like I had to hide things to be accepted. As an adult I feel the same but to a lesser degree, I hide mistakes and perceived flaws. 
* Repress feelings: Childhood, anger, strong emotions were not ok, you just got over them on your own and then everybody pretended nothing had happened. As an adult, I repress a lot of emotions, anger, sadness, shame, sexuality, aggression, hurt, fear, love 
* Making sure other people dont have feelings: not sure in childhood. As an adult, I treated the emotions about an issue the same as the issue itself. I would say/think The situation is xyz and therefore your feelings are wrong. I am scared of other peoples emotions. 
* Avoiding problems and difficult situations: as a child I avoided competition because it make me nervous and I avoided trying at things in case I failed. Basically the same as an adult, I also avoid problems in relationships.",0

If men are already the main danger to women and service is mandatory, then having only men do it actively REDUCES the safety of women in society, since now men are not only physically stronger and much fitter due to having spent several months if not years working on physical fitness, they're also trained in how to control, subdue, and even kill people.

I do a bit of life coaching sometimes - two of my coaching clients are shorter dudes - one is 5'7, one 5'6. One was a virgin in his 30's when he first started seeing me; he's since gotten laid about 5 times now (over the course of a year). He absolutely had to work harder than a tall guy like me - and that's exactly what he did. No reason you can't do the same (even if you have to work fucking hard to get there - that'll just make your victory even more meaningful).

Oh fuck man, that chicken breast and greens diet. I did that for a while but it killed me lol. If it drives you too insane and you can't stick to it - try other diets. A bunch of them work for weight loss (keto works best for me now, but I lost the \~75lbs by eating whatever the hell I wanted and just sticking to 1500 calories - that's called ""IIFYM dieting"").

Gym - you seeing a trainer or a coach? I can't say that I ""earned"" my gym gains (I mean obviously I did the work) - 95% of the credit goes to my weightlifting coach though. I'm a lazy bastard so I literally just pay him to force me to workout - there's no way in hell I would have gotten strong without him. So many days I've said ""I don't really want to work out today, Dave. Can you yell at me and make me do it?"" and that's exactly what he does.

2684,2685,"please stop valuing the opinion of men you see onlinethis is not a typical ""feel good"" post. this is a reminder.

**TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.**

if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value.

men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that.

but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better.

I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women.

these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s.

so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked.

also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks.

so don't give a damn about other subs like gonewild, butterface, etc. while facial bone structure is really really important there are many cute-the-girl-next-door girls who would be seen ugly online while in real life they would be wanted.",1
5741,5742,"@abhinav rajput just today i saw a feminist tv program where a male feminist
was saying women are superior to men, were superior, and will be superior.
imagine if this was revered where a woman says that men are superior to women
in a tv program, there would be a massive social outrage and the tv channel
would lose its license. this proves that we are living in a female dominated
society where men have very few rights. while women can commit crimes and get
away with it. and feminism is about female dominated and male subjugation. not
about gender equality as it claims to be.",0
4040,4041,"Yeah, IF you can get plates on a rotation you will have that drama sometimes, but the sex will be constant.

In a LTR that goes to kids (we want offspring or at least the majority) you will make sacrifices as the sex won't be so good. She knows pretty well she has the upper hand as a gatekeeper of sex in that position. You will have to game her constant, make her desirable and overall make sacrifices of your free time. And when the kids come you will have dry years to come.

So tell me why you need to be affected by a plate going broke? I know that the majority of guys here, including me want an unicorn that will be dtf and easy to live with in the long term, but that is unrealistic and 99.99% of the time won't happen.

As a side-note, I would add that since I've become more successful, I started to understand more how hot women can develop such a bitchy attitude: when you're attractive, everyone (men and women) wants a piece of you. Some want to fuck you, some just want to be seen with you, some want to be validated by you.


At the beginning it's nice, it boosts your ego. But it gets old real quick, and it's hard not to be mean to the 20th person who comes bother you and doesn't get the clear clues that you're not interested.

This is coming from an obese dude with a beard and I'm thinking ""why does he want pretty girls"", but AT LEAST he's not mean and he doesn't hate women like men online do. He doesn't think that women are ""dating Chads"" and stuff like that. But then again ugly guys easily trick girls into sleeping with them where I live and there's enough pretty girls to go around so maybe that's why they haven't gone full inkel yet.",1

I watched the movie today and I don't feel that it's anyway hurting 'the so-
called feminist ego'. Instead the entire movie is all about acknowledging the
character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love
for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed
Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life
Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I
really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the
air. Instead I support true feminism--equality for both the sexes, male as
well as female without any kind of discrimination on any ground. Also,
negative values are negative for everyone.. Irrespective of men and women.",0

410,411,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

3522,3523,"When your Career=More InterestAm I the only one who gets annoyed when a girl is suddenly more interested when she finds out about your career? I realize they see this as an opportunity to score big and get beta bucks. But am I the only one who loses interest in a girl when that happens? Have had it happen a couple times where shes more eager to be in my life and shes always revolving things around my career/career ambitions. Always gets on my nerves and usually ends with me never contacting them again. Just curious to see if Im not alone in dropping that girl immediately or if anyone uses that dumb stuff to their advantage

Edit:
Just cause everyone is asking. Im in the field of law still finishing up my studying though. I like the comments so far. But Ill throw in a more specific example of when this has happened. Ill mention the career field and they suddenly ask what car I drive, type of house I want etc. Another thing is like when Im confident or vague they start saying like yah I can tell why youre in the field. What annoys me is that they are extra inclined to be in my life and suddenly everything I do is cause of my career lol. Its not a bad I guess. But its just off putting cause its just my career. Im really not the type to care about what field anyone is in cause Im not very judgmental. There is a plus side I guess. Talking about cases that involve like murder always gets a girl extra interested lol. So at least I always have a story.

>One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. 

Gentlemen.... understand this.  A woman who is cheating will lie and deny better than any man who gets accused of lying.  The tears come on.  The ""how can you not trust me"" lines come out.  They will act offended, upset, hurt, etc., that you could accuse them of something so horrible.  And the kicker... they say this with HIS cum still on her breath.  I lived this shit.  It's amazing how far women will carry the betrayal.  Lies.  Trickle truths.  Gaslighting.  Manipulation.

>Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation...

I had to do that once.  When she was in the ""nothing happened"" stage, she showed me edited screenshots, where she deleted PARTS of the conversation.  The conversation made it look like it was all him.  Years later, I found the REAL screenshots in her email. She saved the full conversation for herself before editing the conversation for me to see.  Cheaters will deny everything until faced with facts IN WRITING or IN VIDEO or IN PICTURES.  

>I am quite happy with this breakup, because man, i have been wanting out, i just needed a legitimate reason for leaving now i finally caught the bitch.

Your main point of weakness.  You wanted to leave her anyway, but waited for a reason.  ""Because I feel like it"" is a reason.  Work on this area.

I am 24 and have had sex with 13 girls. Im currently on a 2 year dry spell.

Heres a breakdown of where I met the women Ive fucked:

 **School**: 3

 **Tinder**: 6

 **Work**: 4

I am not in school now. Tinder doesnt work for me anymore. My current job has no attractive females.

I am a decent looking dude and understand the many concepts of seduction and attraction. However, with the only three areas that Ive had success with women out of the picture, Ive got no clue where to meet women to end this dry spell.

Im not depressed about it or anything, I actually really value my time alone. I just think its time to smash some walls or maybe put myself into a position to have a selection of girls that I can choose from to have a intimate relationship with.

Thestory kicking off with the hero being falsely accused of rape was especially controversial, with many seeing it as being at odds with the zeitgeist of the #MeToo movement, if not wholly opposing it. This led to many Western fans in particular criticizing the series for its casual misogyny, though the sentiment was significantly less felt in Japan. Regardless, though this plot point is played for laughs, many felt that the confines of a fantasy isekai might not be the best place to handle such a serious topic.

4727,4728,"How to be Alpha AND likeable?Hey guys. Since becoming more alpha Ive actually lost friends rather than gained them. I get girls more easily but men seem to be threatened by me and theyre passive aggresive/purposely leaving me out of events etc. Also new men I meet who are physically more beta/dont workout are passive aggressive toward me even when I am nice to them and dont compete with them. Sometimes this happens with other jacked men too. 

Just before lockdown started, I went to a bar with friends and was hooking up with a friend of a friends gf. We were all there together and I started getting attention from some other girls. Another woman (few years older) tried to hit it off with me in front of everyone and I played it cool and she left for a bit. I didnt initiate anything. Then I went to the toilet and she followed me. My friend clocked it and came to grab me.. he told her to piss off and was angry with me. He said I was supposed to be dating his gfs friend and I wasnt strong enough with the other woman but I could tell he was just jealous that I got attention and he didnt. He was punching me in the ribs calling me stupid but to me it was a translation for Im angry that you got so much attention and I cant get that

Now Im a nice guy. Even when I know other men cant compete with me I dont rub it in their face because honor and respect. And getting girls isnt the goal of my life. I actually want real bros. It just pisses me off that they cant see that and by being nice I get treated like shit its weird. I didnt do anything wrong with this woman. I got attention that I didnt look for.

So my question is how do you be Chad AND likeable at the same time? My friends joke that I look like a fuckboy which means they subconsciously think I look like I fuck a lot of women but they only put a negative spin on it because they cant do the same. They have left me out of the pack so many times as if Im some dishonourable guy who chooses hoes over bros but I never do.

My female friend whos a PHD biologist (a very logical female whos honest about hypergamy) told me that Im a threat to 90% of men. Also at the bar my friends gf told me when she was drunk that Im really handsome and every girl at the bar probably wants to fuck me. My friend didnt hear and neither did the girl I was dating. (Her friend)

So what am I doing wrong and how do I become more likeable? It seems that men dont respect me for whatever reason. Are betas more liked by everyone because theyre softer and more agreeable? I mean Im never an asshole to people but Im always strong in my convictions and never lie. I thought this would command respect from other people but it doesnt seem to. Hmm or maybe thats not it. Its just I have this one friend who everyone loves but hes not alpha at all. Hes adopted the new age mantra and is all about positive vibes etc. Im not like that as Im a realist, but Im not an asshole either. So I dont get it.

3284,3285,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

Something I've noticed though is women acting like a wife when they are only a girlfriend which only gives a man more reason not to marry. What do you think is the difference between being a girlfriend and being a wife is? What behaviors should a wife do but not a girlfriend as to not give too much to a man who hasnt fully committed to her yet? I am sure there are many different answers for different women even within this community. As someone who is a girlfriend and not quite a wife Im interested in what you ladies think.,0

3400,3401,"The sexual selection mechanism, which is how you feel in terms of attraction, doesnt select for this, so you need to make conscious modern world alterations to the primal strategy of sexual selection.

Youre attracted to a guy at the top of some hierarchy, or at least who presents honest signals of being there. This is why psychopaths are attractive, bad boys, the best at sport, celebrities, confident frame-controller, etc.

Men do not start at the top of the dominance hierarchy, they work for it.
Unlike the past, men have a good chance at getting there without being murdered or put in their place by those already at the top. Sort of more fair, where hard work is more likely to pay off at the very least.

So, you dont need to aim for guys already at the top (or at the best youve ever had and expect you can get), which is some consolation. Since you can invest in a guy and he can get there after the fact. Yeah it sucks that you cant just wait at the finish line. But, you can make a difference to a mans life and allow him the frame, be feminine for him and allow him to maintain and steadily grow into a more ideal man which benefits you and him. Not manipulation, but simply being feminine brings out qualities for a man. Win-win.

If he is to be this level of attractive to you, he will get the attention of other women. So youll try to get commitment and manipulate him to ensure your security and this will generate beta behaviour from him if he gives in, its called poison dripping and makes him worse so that you feel secure. And then hell be unattractive. Or he doesnt give in, but maybe he sleeps around and you dont want that either. Win-lose in short term maybe, lose-lose in long term definitely 

And on and on, there is no ideal for you, no perfect situation without a compromise.

*Conclusion*: figure out what you want to compromise, to sacrifice, and what you value most. What is the ideal situation, what is the ideal man? Do you have the red pill knowledge to simulate the potential downfalls and to figure out if that ideal situation is realistic.

Make your goal specific in that way.
Figure out if it is realistic, and achievable.",0

Im only a nurse, but we still make good income, and for a few months I was making more than my partner. Now, were making about the same. But, my partner recognized the feminine skills that are involved with a caregiving field, and while I know I have a strong intellect, I admire and look up to him so much. For his ideas, leadership, perspective, Im almost always asking his advice or opinion instead of feeling the need to give him advice. I think these things lessened his insecurity regarding the pay difference, and I always make sure he feels like the man of the house. Id definitely up-play the feminine traits that make you good at your job, and find partners you deeply admire and respect. You cant fake that. 

Honestly, men intimidated enough by income to leave are probably not secure enough in the value they bring to the table as men. I do need my man, not for financial reasons but for 1000 other reasons. Find someone who sees that.

First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

I tried to get him to elaborate on his logic, and all he said was basically that if women fart every 5-15 minutes its her bodys way of only farting 0-1x during sex, which would still be acceptable. So what he was asking was if women fart periodically every 5-15 minutes during ovulation so it would be acceptable if the ovulating woman was to have sex.

According to him all he knows about ovulation is women are more likely to get pregnant and they are gassy.

1798,1799,"Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not
follow western culture(even banned in Christianity).  
Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can
only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big
misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's
genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be
genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a
gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of
nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind
later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries
earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who
fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had
multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started
getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor
he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven
that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout
your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us
a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments.
So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it
in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their
opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a
mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy
psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just
to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the
rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue
our sexual and spiritual life.  
At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the
Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be
legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature
given laws and the Truth of life.

3310,3311,"What is your opinion on John Stoltenberg's view that masculinity and femininity are artificially created concepts that should be abandoned entirely? He also believes that masculinity as a concept is inherently toxic (I'll get into the details below, he did an interview where he explains why)In case you didn't know, he describes himself as a radical feminist. He did an interview with Vice.com where he goes into more detail on his views on this topic, but I think I can summarize them pretty well in this post. [Here's his full interview with Vice if you to know his view on this issue in greater detail](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/zmk3ej/all-masculinity-is-toxic&ved=2ahUKEwjbmcu_5fnoAhXDTN8KHQ12B80QFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1cB20RqEciXqCreKtu6mEY&ampcf=1). I recommend reading it.

Basically his argument is that traits and qualities associated with masculinity or femininity are just human qualities that any individual might have, man or woman. Men can be shy, quiet, emphatic, etc. and women can be violent, aggressive, prideful, etc. John think's it's unfair that some of these qualities are associated heavily with one gender or the other, and that qualities such as empathy and kindness are universal human qualities that should not be genderized or viewed as feminine. Likewise, women can be violent too, and as such violence should not be viewed as solely masculine. All these traits should just be viewed as human traits. I pretty much agree with this point of view.

However, he argues that the main thing that distinguishes masculinity and femininity (as social concepts/ideas/roles) is that masculinity promotes violence and aggression, while femininity does not. As such, he argues that masculinity as a social concept is inherently toxic, because masculinity promotes harmful behaviors that femininity doesn't promote. Even though he believes that toxic behaviors like violence and aggression are not inherent qualities of men or women, he believes that that traits and behaviors promoted by masculinity are generally more toxic than those promoted by femininity. Still, he thinks masculinity and femininity as concepts should be done away with.

Thoughts? I recommend reading the interview with Vice.",0

If I held that spider to get over my fear, and it bit me or jumped on to my face, I would be even more afraid than before cause I would have verified my fear is rational. If someone who is afraid of women was told just do it with no social skills, they will have a bad experience and further push them away from approaching. Theres a process that needs to happen well before actually trying to overcome the fear. It may seem silly to you to be afraid of women, but it is a genuine fear a lot of men have and I dont think that telling them its irrational is the best way to go about it because they will not want to talk about their fear anymore and not seek help or guidance.",0

Once I did the payment, I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and I got a no. From there I said, its ok, I understand. Weirdly enough, I felt good and I was okay with her choice. Her rejecting me didnt make me any less of a man. 

My mental critic tried to spin it off to say she rejected you because of your horrible crooked teeth (Im getting braces next month) and your horrible face but all I knew was, I was getting somewhere and being rejected doesnt make me any less of a man.

3689,3690,"What I believe to be going on here is you have noticed how the media grabs the attention of people, largely young and immature that dont have developed emotions, portray romantic situations. When we are young and the person we like has a boyfriend or girlfriend, we often think of the other as a bad person so we arent guilty for wanting someone that is committed/involved/seeing to someone else, especially when we arent getting any attention. When media targets this audience, they portray this situation to be true, affirming the viewers feeling of their interests partner as a dick. We love feeling right. While this is largely portrayed as a young man having interest in a girl whos ex or partner is a dick (Scott pilgrim vs the world for example), it is portrayed both ways. Often, the love interest male is dating a pretty girl that isnt right for him (Im looking at you Taylor swift in you belong with me). Essentially, it is hoping that the audience watches this to affirm their feelings, so they consume the rest of the medium (movie, album, etc). It reflects a me not we mentality when it comes to love. The subject in both gendered roles is only thinking about what they want, disregarding the other person of interests choice in their actual partner. I studied what love actually is using a lot of philosophical backing, and I can say with confidence this is more possession than it is love, which is what we feel in our high school days and thats fine. Many young people confuse the two, as long as our life experience enable us to move on and exist with self love and eventual outward love. In short, its a product of immaturity more than sexism, but sexism can definitely spin this situation into something else when it comes to relationships. All that being said, people dont always choose people that are good for them. No one is perfect theres a very interesting psychological theory that analyses the people we find appealing romantically, and how it relates to our past. People are likely to date those that give us familiar types of suffering as opposed to those that show us new types. For example, if your parents always yelled at you and 
You never got over it, you would date someone that yelled to communicate adversity. Same thing with passive aggression, violence, and communication. We choose the familiar, unless we actively take steps to avoid it. And when someone we want to date chooses someone who gives them the suffering they are used to, it justifies the feelings I previously discussed EVEN MORE. (Heres a really cool video on the suffering bit, its far from hard science but is a really interesting theory on relationship dynamics as it relates to developmental psychology: https://youtu.be/Hvysy11716g). To summarize, love triangles are common and no one thinks wow my love interest didnt choose me, but thats fine! Until they love themselves.

Edit: had to change the Taylor swift song to the one I was thinking of, and added the part about relationship dynamics",0

5994,5995,"A weapon being used on your mind -- And what you can doDiscussed in greater detail in [my video](https://youtu.be/By8cgQaii5E).

Today's generations have something no other did before.   

Previous generations had access to it but it was much simpler and less damaging if abused. And you likely had to go somewhere in person to acquire it which in itself might have prevented you for fear of embarrassment.   

Access to porn and what is available has become too powerful.  

I remember growing up in the 90's. My friends and I stumbled upon a magazine stash at a nearby construction site. We thought we had just found gold. We each took one of the magazines home.. and guarded it like the One True Ring.   

Fast forward a few years later and those same friends and I are trading floppy disks that could hold a few pictures or maybe 1-2 video clips of 3 or 4 seconds.   

Then a few years later broadband internet starting coming out and was available in my neighborhoods. Back then we called it ""cable internet."" File sharing programs were popular for downloading MP3s but they were also gigantic repositories for adult material. You could type in a search string and click download all. A few hours later you'd have tons and tons of video material.   

Then the streaming sites came and we have today's version of modern porn access.   

I realize many of you might not have a problem with porn. I myself have been able to suppress my use of it. But we are here to help other men. A lot of the guys that read this site are young and might be struggling with this. I used to struggle before I knew I was struggling with it.  

At this point I believe porn is a weapon being used to subdue the desires and passions of millions of men around the world. Think about it. There is a reason why Russia and China both have laws banning the production of it. These are our rivals... and they must be laughing knowing Americans and Westerners are mostly subdued by this degeneracy. Blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis.   

As someone who has used Porn while in an LTR and then stopped using it there is a big difference in sexual pleasure once you abstain. Death Grip is real and makes real sex less pleasurable. Once you beat death grip sex will feel like losing your virginity every time. If you're not whacking it often you won't be suffering from death grip but it is real for those whacking it on a nightly basis.   

And for those who think approaching women is not worth it... That's likely your opinion because you have an outlet for your desires. Take that outlet away and your sexual drive will take off like a rocket ship and you will inevitably become good at cold-approach because you will have no other choice.  

There is no shame in admitting you might have a problem and there are tools that can help. Porn blocking tools exist and work in multiple ways. Of course they can't stop you on every single device you own so you'll need some discipline.  

The NoFap community on this website and other places is also very helpful for support and questions.  

Other men will literally jump in a cold shower in the first few days of abstaining if they must.  

There is no shame if you have been a victim of this.  

Again, not all of you will be in this position. You might be enjoying a good porn-laced whack every now and then and that's fine. And some of you might already know that you can whack it without porn entirely and its much healthier for you. I'm definitely not advocating for pure noFap forever. Just don't let it get out of control. Build your power and testosterone by keeping it in your balls for a week or so before release if you're by yourself.  

And remember, dating use app is on the rise even on lock-down. Women are horny and alone and want a man to get in bed with them regardless of the local rules of social-distance in place.

Lessons learned:  

\-My opinion on Porn is that it is a tool used by rival governments to hurt the men of The West.  

\-Death grip is real and comes from nightly porn use. It will prevent you from feeling maximum pleasure when having sex.  

\-Daily use of Porn is hurting your motivation to speak to women and form relationships.  

\-Tools exist to prevent or curb porn use and there are other methods you can do to help in the form of distracting yourself.

3286,3287,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time. If she is chasing your validation she won't give a fuck about her faggy coworker. Flirting is fun and females love attention. If you're giving her too much attention it won't mean anything to her and she will seek it thru other sources. Dread game is goat.

4369,4370,"A lesson I learned from a stranger on the busThis past winter, I was riding the bus consistently to a new job in a new city. I'm a nurse, and the transition was stressful, and the shifts were long and the mornings were dark, early, damp, and cold. There was a woman who would ride the same bus at the same time as me, and although we never exchanged a word, she has made a lasting impact on me, and I find myself thinking of her often. I wanted to share my experience with you ladies. 

This woman was an average woman, likely in her 50s, with a rather plain face, plain clothes, and sometimes rather disheveled. She often sat across from me, with muddy rain boots, and hair slightly askew from wind and rain. Every other person on the bus was either sleeping, or on their phone, scowling, irritable, and cold. 

But this woman wore a smile. Her expression was always soft, inviting, friendly, and she had a peaceful presence about her that was mesmerizing and downright fascinating. She was beautiful, warm, and kind. She never looked impatient, she never scowled down at a phone screen, she would not look away when I met her gaze but would smile sweetly at me, and I would smile back. We shared these rides together in silence, and I found myself smiling too. I would look out the window as the first traces of light came up through the treetops, and I would find stillness in an otherwise stressful commute. 

Then, as weeks passed, I noticed a shift in my own behavior. I noticed myself smiling at work, among coworkers who were stressed, anxious, and exhausted. I noticed that I could make the people around me laugh, and smile too, and maybe even complain less. My patients seemed to smile more as well,  despite their suffering and fear. I noticed that I would catch myself smiling while standing in line at the grocery store, or while doing the dishes, or weeding. I would smile in the car, when going on rides with my partner.

And as the world has changed through this pandemic, as people have begun social distancing, and fearing not only the virus but one another, smiles have seemed to disappear altogether, mask or no mask. 

Whether you cover your face or not, smile more. Smile for yourself, smile with your eyes. It will change your life, it might change someone else's. It is feminine, it is gentle, it is kind. It seems we need more of that these days than ever.",0

6171,6172,"i knew it !! i knew that you were gonna ask me that as your next question.
see. i clearly told you that the examples that i gave dont prove anything. so
i did not imply that choosing or not choosing are related to normal or natural
behaviour. its just that the statistics speak something. no one really knows
what it is, all the way down to the fundamentals of sexuality. and by the way,
bestiality may be just normal or natural. or it maybe just disgusting. but who
knows ? maybe bestiality is just another form of sexual orientation ! buuuut.
why should people be against it then ?? simple. because even though a person
may wanna have sex with an animal, there is no way of knowing whether the
animal also wants to have sex with the person. i told you in that previous
comment that consensual relationships are nobody's business. animals cant give
consent, coz neither can we understand them nor can they understand us. you
can end up raping the animal. so that closes the chapter on bestiality and it
must be forbidden. next question that you may wanna ask is: pedophilia ! so,
again, pedophilia may just be another form of sexual orientation. who knows ?
buuut again ! a child is not really capable of giving consent, isnt it ?
that's why we have laws in most countries about the age of consent. some
places its 16 some 18 blah blah blah. but its not 12 years old anywhere, i
guess. coz most kids are just too immature at that age, even though different
kids start maturing at different ages. no one actually knows what the right
age is. maybe we'll never know. but its reasonable to assume that kids are
mature by the time they are like 15 or 16 so that is the widely accepted age
range of consent in many countries. but it is always dangerous for a pedophile
to assume that a kid that he wants to have sex with can give him/her consent,
bcoz you dont really know if the child is old enough to think about it. thats
why sex with children should also be forbidden, well until they reach the age
of maturity, as i have been saying all along. so if an adult wants to have sex
with an animal or a child, but never acts upon his/her desires, well then that
is fine and he/she should not be criminalized in society. there is a
difference between a pedophile and a child molester. but anyway, you get my
point, i hope. now i know the next question you are probably gonna ask, but
ill wait for your reply to see if thats what it is. lol",1

5541,5542,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

This tries directly into it being related to this fragile, bullshit macho attitude.

So what you said has real effects and is not just theory. For example feminists blocking the only ever male welfare officer at university in the ENTIRE UK. Making a campaign against him so he stepped down and it never went ahead:

>Olivia Bailey, NUS national women's officer, said: ""Discrimination against men on the basis of gender is so unusual as to be non-existent, so what exactly will a men's society do?"" ""To suggest that men need a specific space to be 'men' is ludicrous, when everywhere you turn you will find male-dominated spaces,"" she added.

I mean just one rebuttal to that is men are a minority in university. In education an example of flat out sexism and institutional sexism at an international scale (which she denies is):

>Throughout the OECD Teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work to boys. Furthermore, a boy will receive 1/3 higher grade in reading tests if the teacher does not know he is a boy (OECD) From teachers give girls higher grades despite boys objectively getting higher test scores

SOURCE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)

Someone with some sense:

>As Sarah McCulloch, the female treasurer of the MENS society at Manchester puts it: ""It's important that everyone be included in the discussion about how to create a more equal and fair society, and I don't believe t**hat we will achieve true equality by allowing men to tag along with the women's liberation movement  men have their own problems.""**

So I have learned some feminists are critical of modern feminism and do actually not like this idea of unidirectional power dynamics with men being oppressors and women being victims and patriachy being responsible for womens individual actions (and mens)... this type of feminism needs to raise up and be the loudest voice because at the moment feminism has gone mad.

they tend to find pleasure in something that goes against nature. So we need

>I cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves.

I've learned that they're never going to give signs that they want physical moves. They will only give signs they *don't want* physical moves. If you are close to her and she leans back, she's not ready yet. If she doesn't, you can move to the next step. If she has some kind of accessories on her wrists or fingers, lightly touch her hand/wrist and ask about them. She'll probably be okay with that, so move to the next step. Lightly brush her hair and compliment her on it. If she doesn't move her head back, you can continue moving up. If she does give a *no* signal, go back one or two steps, then work your way from there again. That's basically how it goes.

Now what helps me easing into getting more touchy is creating excuses. If she's wearing heels, take her down a route with some stairs, and lock your arm into hers for ""support"". Go roller skating and take her hand. Teach her how to shoot pool or throw darts--anything that involves touching and moving parts of her body, under the guise that it's not *only* sexual touching. Kinda like innuendo in speech.

One thing I'm keen to try, is at the first meet going for a handshake and instead bring her hand up to kiss it.

3856,3857,"Musings on a MSM's journey towards masculinity.Me: 26 years old, teacher, living in a big but not huge city.

I am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity.

I was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth.

I had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago.

Beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men.

I began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily.

Of course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted.

A turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time.

I came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned:

\- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness.

\- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity.

\- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with.

\- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles.

\- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood.

\- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood.

\- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women.

\- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc.

\- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities.

\- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc.

\- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice.

\- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play.

\- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina.

\- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again.

Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit
of a common sense are hurt-  
1\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie.  
According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can
just impose whatever you like on her?  
2\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country,
let alone the question of feminism in that scene.  
  
And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned.

any person keep false allegations on a person who is innocent that person
becomes the enemy of the humanity.  
look. according to me there are two genders males and females that's it i
don't give a damn about third gender. i am anti lgbt person who will oppose
them because i feel they are huge threat to humanity all women and men will
suffer if they get corrupted.  
according to me feminist is about the rights of girls that it not about men at
all. all i care about humanity,nature,wildlife and animals that's it. always
fighting for equality for education is fine,jobs fine if you have potential to
take care of the pressure no problem go ahead, but if you don't want to change
initial after marriage that is not acceptable you should always be called of
your husband name or his initial which i don't agree if anyone oppose that  
asking for father share of property ok no problem. but if men can marry
multiple women doesn't mean women can marry i will always be against the idea
. fighting for rights in everything is not acceptable. equality in good things
is ok i have full support but not in bad things also. always don't imitate men
for everything. few things ok. always crying over men that women are not
getting justice saying this is wrong.  
if you have potential to take care of both career and family equally then no
problem go ahead. if you are not able to balance both then forget about job.
just take care of children because children can be raise properly by women
more than men. if you want to get divorce though your husband not done
anything wrong then forget about asking money from him. if you are earning
money good then you have no right to ask money from your husband if you are
getting divorced.  
i am not feminist at all i agree women should fight for equality for few
things not everything. if men can do why can't we do. now men are drinking and
smoking try to stop them and don't become like them. if men are bribing try to
stop them don't do the same thing. if men are going for casino try to stop

We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story.

This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). 

Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). 

At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint. This seemed to calm her down a bit and I let her spin the hamster to a conclusion that all is good. After which we got down to business. 

Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here).",1

5675,5676,"My teachers were generally pretty kind to me -- because I was a star pupil with a genuine love for learning and a creative, out-of-the-box perspective on just about every topic. HOWEVER, when I was bullied in class, they would do nothing to stop the bullies from picking on me. When I complained, they told me that without proof there was nothing they could do.

One day, in 7th grade, I brought a tiny recording device (this was in the late '90s, when dinosaurs walked the Earth and smart phones were not yet a given), and used it to record my bullies' merciless insults during our group lab. I planned on using the recording as proof of my suffering so maybe the teacher could intervene. Unfortunately I became upset and let the head bully know I was recording him. He immediately told the teacher I was recording him and the teacher, with an apology, confiscated my device.

There was another time in 6th grade where my bully was punished, but I was punished for my reaction to the bully. The bully in question publicly and loudly accused me of m""\*%$\*@$ing in the bathroom during an indoor recess held in the gym, and I left school right then and there, riding my bike home in the snow to escape the humiliation. My bully received 3 after-school detentions for her action, and I received a single day of in-school suspension (I got to do all my schoolwork and homework privately in school, and then read all day, not that much of a punishment).

There was also the time some idiot etched a b@mb threat across the bathroom walls in 9th grade, and a few bully types decided to accuse me. I was, of course, called into the school psychologist's office and questioned. And of course when I tried to explain my suicidal thoughts resulting from years of bullying to that same school psychologist, I was sent to a hospital for a suicide risk assessment. Same after the 11th-grade ""Project Love"" anti-bullying seminar, in which I publicly announced the division between school-aged ""Predators"" and ""Prey Animals"" and theorised that merciless bullying by the stronger ""Predators"" was a subconscious attempt to convince the less popular among the population to off ourselves, culling the herd until only the more desirable folks remained.

My uni profs also rather loved me, with one or two exceptions where I just wasn;t invested int he class...but then again, most of my uni profs were not supermodels.
