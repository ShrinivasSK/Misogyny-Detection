2524,2525,"How To AMOG Beta MalesIt shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.

&#x200B;

Hello Everyone,

I have just watched this documentary which tends to show the reality of this hookup culture particularly focusing on graduates celeberating spring break on florida beaches. Some particular examples I would like to quote,

""It is easier to find FWB than boyfriends"" (girl 1)

""Guys believe they are entitled to our bodies; there is almost this one guy in every party who try to rip off my clothes"" (girl 2)

""I had always felt pressure from woman magazines to look sexy for boys and engage in frequent sex to get the validation I wanted"" (girl 3)

""I have always felt pressurerized to lose my virginity"" (Guy 1)

""Sex is not about love anymore, its about pleasure only. I don't have to know a girl to get into her pants. Let me demonstrate you (goes to demonstrate it)... You see, its so easy, the more intoxicated she is, the more likely she will drop her panties"" (Guy 2)

""I have come with my girlfriend here and I don't mind if she hooks up somewhere \[lol a cuck\]"" (Guy 3)

I live in a conservative muslim country where sexual market is controlled and free sex is frowned upon but thanks to feminism it is quickly changing. I used to believe that I had a disadvantage by not being born into a western liberal country but I don't think its true anymore. Its not because the girls are magically better but its because feminism has still not been able to destroy the fabric of this society. A regulated sexual market is both good for men and women, women retain their pair bonding ability and men don't have to worry about being compared to past sexual partners. Its a win-win situation for almost everyone (almost). Most people confuse TRP with another form of seduction and alpha male to be just a fucking machine. However, the reality is that in a society having the concept of masculinity solely revolving around the number of sexual partners could (almost) never produce homely virgin girls (with few exceptoins). The rise of feminsim has seen the rise of pornification of society, single motherhood, divorce rates, false rape accusations and other social ills. Women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas. They love to masculinize themsleves in order to get the dose of power which they could never taste even if they do they shall never be content because a woman's satisfaction lies in her being protected by a man. Being alpha is not about banging numerous women, this may have been an advantage during the dark ages but we are no longer in the dark ages and sticking to this dogma may damage male pysche as well e.g. depressing over not losing one's virginity due to peer pressure instead of working towards worthwhile goals. Is Dan Brazalian more alpha than an anverage guy who is working towards his goal and fortunately have a stable unicorn?. Hence, we should modify who really is  Alpha male:

1. Always working on self improvment.
2. Protecting his children and women (unicorn exists in controlled sexual markets).
3. Resisting Feminism and porn culture.
4. Achieving goals.
5. (Add what you think is constructive).

The degeneration of western society and downfall of fatherhood shall continue to move on if something is not done against this hedonistic feminsim. Although men have taken advantage from this hook up culture but the price which we are paying is far bigger than what can be put into words.  Banging multiple women cannot make our lives better, yes there is a burst of pleasure but its not good long term. I don't think a hook up culture and controlled sexual markets can co-exist ever.

Most men here use TRP knowledge to get into panites which does work because we know the nature of women but to find a traditional homely women is almost impossible.  I utilize TRP knowledge to pass shit test of women and her attraction only grows when you pass her shit tests. I was one of the victims of plantation culture until I came to TRP and received salvation.

First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.

5604,5605,"Had my first date in 3 months. Accidentally blew my load in a minute - Can this be salvaged?Well boys - Have I got a story for y'all.  I welcome any words of advice, wisdom, or how to play this moving forward.

Like many of you, I've been in quarantine for the past 2 months. Finally, in the last 2 weeks, I decided to say fuck it and download Tinder again. Before that, I was doing some solid self-introspection, reading, home workouts, learning to trade options, no drinking, no weed, lots of meditation. All was well. I was feeling great!

During this time, I also stayed away from Porn and only jacked it once a week to no porn.

Fast forward to yesterday and I had my first outside date with a bird in that span of time. Super fucking cute, short Asian girl with amazing tits. I took her to my usual spot, which is this outdoor walking street with cafes and whatnot. We grab some cold drinks and start working around the area. All was going phenomenal with exceptional banter, kino, easy-flowing conversation, etc.

I said let's get outta here and we headed back to my place to 'watch a documentary' as that's what it said she liked to do in her profile.

We hung out on the couch, more kino, kissing, slowing escalating, she's getting wet and ready to go. It's getting to the point where she has to go home, but I take is LMR and just keep escalating.

Eventually, her dress on the floor and those gorgeous fucking tits are flopping around in my face.

We're both naked and eventually, I caveman carry her to my bed. We're still working up to sex, which is fine, so I flip her around and we start 69'ing.

Well here's where it all went to hell! After 2 months of quarantine, and not even having the chance to touch a bird, I fucking let myself accidentally get way over-excited, and as she's giving me the best head this side of 6 months - using her mouth in ways only god knows  - before you know it I'm shooting a giant premature fucking load in her mouth. I lasted maybe a minute. Not my proudest minute at that. I had no problem when she was jacking me off vigorously, but as soon as she went down on me, while I'm eating her out, I fucking lost it.

I haven't cum this fast in years.

To make matters worse, she jumps up and runs to the bathroom to spit out my spunk, just leaving me sitting there on the bed.  I mean, maybe she was surprised at my load, maybe I fucking hit the back of her throat. I don't fucking know.

She comes back out of the bathroom, and I try to play it off as if I'm just gonna finish her. I go down on her for a little bit longer and she says she needs to finally get home - it's 11:30 pm and she has to wake up at 7 am. I say cool and here's where she proceeds to give me the ego dick punch of death. ""Oh - you came so fast"" in what can only be described as a disappointing tone.

I wasn't quick enough on my feet to come up with a good line, but I also didn't fucking show emotion either. I just played it off to quarantine and not having any action in a while. Just like it was no big deal, and just hoping it was a shit-test. So many other things I could have said, trust me I know. But the damage was done and my ego lay in tiny fucking shards all over the floor.

So boys - what do you think? Any chance of salvaging this. I feel like there's no fucking way I'm gonna contact her now. Gonna just have to wait for her.  And if she does contact, I'll just never bring it up again like it never even happened. Again - every other part of the date was great. I actually enjoyed conversing with her. That is the first time in a while.

Thing is, I've got 3 more dates lined up with 3 different birds this week alone, but I'll be dammed if my ego won't let me forget this performance. Of course, I want the revenge fuck now to show her what I can really do in bed.

What do you think lads?

**Edit #1**: She literally just reached out asking for some innocuous link to another documentary I had mentioned. If she really wanted to ghost, she wouldn't have contacted at all, I think.

**Edit #2:** Lads, you're all legends! Cheers for the solid advice from all of you. I truly appreciate it. Some hard lessons to learn, but that's all part of the process.

3891,3892,"Western Society was built because of the culture of monogamy where the bottom 80% of men made major contributions. These contributions were made in exchange for access to reproduction they wouldnt normally have access to (due to socially enforced monogamy, religion, patriarchy) 

If majority of men truly become incel, society will crumble and devolve back to the days when the 80/20 rule was even more apparent 8000 years ago when [17 women reproduced for every 1 man](https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success)

Women's mating strategies/preferences are not selected for advanced societies. They select for muscles,  broad shoulders, height, jawline - traits that were advantageous in ancient times rife with tribal warfare. They don't select for IQ which is necessary for advanced western civilizations

The feminist pipe dream is to revert to our primal mating strategies (for women) while retaining all the benefits provided by the unworthy masses of men giving rise to modern civilization. Good luck to them all.

A modern western society cannot exist when hypergamy is fully realized like 8000 years ago. Yes, muh lady will be more free but society will devolve",1
3836,3837,"If you improve youself so much, why would you need a girl?This is a very genuine question.   
Game theory aside, you'll find that one of the most recommended advises on the seduction community is to work on yourself instead of chasing women. Hell, learning about seduction and game is in itself self improvment. 

From my experience. I have reached states where I was very, very mature. I was neither angry nor impatient nor insecure nor needy. I was confident, calm, smooth, rational, fun but not forcibely, everything was so genuine about me, and I felt totally in synch with myself.  

What I noticed about those moments, aside from the inner peace I had. Is that people just followed me. If I was with a girl then seducing her was not necessary, Hell I didn't have to talk or say anything, I could sit there with a girl totally silent and somehow I could feel that she's enjoying my company. Same with guys. And when I said let's go there or do that and I lead, they just followed, no questions asked, no ""Why!! we can't, it's better to do that and that"" It was a great feeling. But I am unable to stay in that state for very long.   


This made me wonder, if I improve myself to the point where I'm in that state most of them time, what would I need girls for apart from sex? I mean everybody will talk about not being needy when you want a girl, but if you're not needy and abundant, why would you need her?

This is a very genuine question and not a condescending one as it may seem, I'm hoping for genuine answers.",1

Honestly, women should be up in arms at the beauty industry for selling makeup and telling women they can enhance their beauty aka telling women they are ugly. No one bats an eye because putting makeup requires little work/effort so anyone can do it to look ""beautiful"", but working out, dieting, and being healthy is apparently too hard for most women to handle so they complain about it like children.

I guy I used to know abandoned his kids for 5 year but got pats in the back for calling his kids on their bday but when she(the wife) divorced him and told the truth about what happened she was a bitch . 
So many men I know rely on their SO so much for basic needs cleaning/cooking that when they put away the dishes or vacuum the floor their heroes or deserve something. 
Men can walk away from their kids but if a women gives them up for adoption/abortion she a monster. 
Men can get away with changing their kids diapers once but god forbid a women hires a nanny or housekeeper. 
Single mother are shunned and laughed at but single fathers are heroes.

* Some success with women, but never feeling like they are in control

* Success with women, failed LTR/marriage that reset them to beta or otherwise damaged their view of the sexual marketplace

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone.

5544,5545,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

-Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)**

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time.

2) Weve been fucking for almost a year, no real intentions on LTR or marriage (some guy mentioned me pushing for marriage?). Thats a dumbass assumption and I dont know why you guys think Im trying to LTR her.

3) Yes she is BPD confirmed. For those of you who are scared shitless of BPD women, Ive maximized my benefits from out relationship. You guys just need to know how to control BPD women and dont be so fucking emotionally manipulated

This is very true. I left academia after my PhD, and that was in hard sciences. But I could see how people are holding onto research themes that make no sense, just because they get funding for it. If they were funded by private corporations, they would long have been gone.   


The word kafkaesque you used is spot on. What has been human's strength since the dawn of  ages is the collaboration between more pragmatic, ambitious, cold-blooded, rational man and the more intuitive, maternal, empathic, emotional and less rational woman. Each trait on each gender can be seen as positive or negative, but they each contribute to a certain balance.

Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

4318,4319,"TRP was meant for Average Frustrated Chumps not Bottom Tier Omegas**Who is the Average Frustrated Chump?**

The average frustrated chump aka our beloved beta has had a semi normal childhood. They know how to talk to people and make friends. They have a friend group that goes outs and meets girls. The average frustrated chumps has gotten girlfriends in the past and knows how to flirt(albeit badly). 

Our AFC is a 5.

The purpose of TRP was to teach 5's how to improve their looks to a 7.5 and how to act like a player.       
 It also teaches men to take women off the pedestal. 

Go to the gym, fix your wardrobe , get an awesome haircut.

 Stop trying to be friends first.  Assume attraction. Kill approach anxiety. 

2-3 years of consistent effort and you can go from a 5 to 7. It works for guys with a decent starting point.

Another important note is that a 5 will see results faster. A wardrobe and hair cut can bring a 5 to 6. His friends will compliment his newbie gains. This postive feedback will motivate him to continue his journey.

**However TRP was never meant for Bottom Tier Omegas**

Omegas are guys who have no social life , no experience with women, are downright unattractive in multiple ways, and  are considers creeps by literally everyone who interacts with them. 


Our Omega is a 2. TRP welcomes all men with open arms and will try to help them. 

In theory TRP could work for them, but there no advice for guys who are starting from zero. 

How do you teach someone how socialize and flirt through a Reddit post? It's almost impossible.  


2-3 years of consistent effort and these guys will go from a 2 to 5. All that work to get mediocre women our AFC was running from . 

And these guys will see no fast results. Girls don't care if the obese guy has swag. Your newbie gains can't compensate for your social anxiety  . They get no positive feedback until they reach the minimum of 5. 


Any new trick or theory they learn from TRP can only be tested years after they see it. The AFC can test it out when he goes out or even on his GF/wife. Maybe an Omega can try it out some girl he's orbited but that's about it. It'll be months of improving himself and learning the basics before he can test TRP.

Even on the topic orbiting the advice should differ. If the Omega has literally one girl in his life, maybe he shouldn't ""next"" her. That's the only socializing with a girl he has. He should practice what hes learnt on her. Our normal beta can find another girl hence he can ""next"" her. 

You'd have to make an entirely new sub for guys who need to get from 2-5.  Then they can graduate to TRP.

**Here I explain the rise of the Blackpill**

The balding, 5'3,  Indian ~~janitor~~ programmer has found TRP. They've always been on Reddit. Reddit was built for these guys.  

This guy will be never be Chad. But TRP will give him hope. And he will be disappointed.  

The OG RP dude bros just didn't quite understand what they were dealing with when they tried to save Redditors . ECs would  tell them to talk to girls and these guys would ask how. ""What do you mean how? Just flirt like you usually do"". Poor asktrp ECs probably never realized they were talking to Omegas. 

Eventually the manlets, autists and  indians/asians realized that even if they did everything TRP said they wouldn't get the results of someone with a better starting point. 

Hence The BlackPill was born - Genetic Determinism the ideology. Some guys simply have lower ceilings.

Some guys will never reach 7.5 and get to date stacies and plate beckies.  Some guys peak at 5. 

""All that work just to be average? lol "" These bottom tier guys all denounced TRP and made their own subs. However one thing they  took from TRP was pushing women off pedestal. They did that perfectly.

This what ultimately lead to the death of TRP.  All the AFCs came improved and left, leaving the dregs of Reddit. The ECs struggled with the omegas who believed they had potential; who eventually graduated. And the omegas who felt they'd never make it  denounced The RedPill and took The BlackPill",1

**Separation:**

* Ex reacted as I predicted to a letter from my lawyer. Im in a difficult position, she has just stopped allowing overnights for bullshit reasons. If I push it I wont see my daughter at all until I get an urgent court application (assuming I do at this time). If I dont push it she feels like she has won and will be encouraged to do this in the future. I have talked to lawyers (two to triangulate what Im being told)  Im finding the whole thing extremely frustrating. I dropped daughter off the other day and ex brought it all up in front of her. I said dont talk about it in front of daughter and she kept going at me while I got in car and drove off.
* So what am I doing  firstly I stopped. I was getting caught up in ego, then I considered a proper time perspective, in 2 years this will all be locked down legally and Ill have most of what I want. So, while it is frustrating and I want to do something the right play is to wait it out (mediation) then have an urgent application ready to go. I will not stop the money during this time although I legally could, it would look like Im retaliating. Previously I had in my mission (and it came back this week because I felt like writing it) Be a man I respect that man would see the frustration and let it pass over him, he would not react to petty ego games to get a short term ego win at the expense of what he really wants in the medium term. He would not forget to think about 2 years from now because something is happening 2 minutes from now. So that is what Im doing, its frustrating but I am going to do what needs to be done to get the best long term outcome.

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

* I feel better than I have in as long as I can remember. Ex is being annoying but I am in a strong position because I have done the work to get myself here. Life is only going to get better because Im going to keep doing the work to make it better. Im doing things that I want to do and am starting to craft a vision rather than just letting life happen to me.
* Still struggling with the tension of doing what I want and feeling good in the moment and doing what I should do which would progress me towards my goals but does not feel good and goes against some internal resistance.
* Following [u/Tyred\_Biggums](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyred_Biggums/) comment last week I have been thinking about Shame/needy partners and selfishness. Im not sure what I want to do for me, I did the NMMNG activity on this and have a few items. Most of these dont raise any issues e.g. I want to do a rally driving course and probably will. But there are a few that get to other issues. One is own a nice car, buying myself a nice car seems selfish because you could spend that money on the greater good. Im not sure 100% where this comes from but my parents have a part. I imagine my dad being disappointed in my decision. Im clearly still not living in my own frame if Im worried about things like that in the first place. Also, looking at shame and picking needy women I think they are two separate issues that feed into each other. I pick needy women because it makes me feel safe, they need me and so I dont have to worry. I feel shame because I feel like having any needs is wrong and will result in love being taken away, I am defective just by having needs. This feels so typical nice guy that I kept looking for something else but that is what it is. I try to have no needs, I dont inconvenience, I am always trying to do the right thing, when you combine that with picking a needy women and a fear of being alone you get my relationships and my codependency issues.
* Im not sure why I am so worried about being lonely/alone. Sometimes I find MRP very nihilistic and feel empty, Im still not sure what to replace that with. I go camping on my own quite a bit and feel happy and fine when Im doing that but with others I still chase something from that connection that I cant ever get. I need to spend more time thinking about this. Or maybe I dont, maybe I just want to have a nice car a fuck a pair of 19 year olds Im not sure yet.

**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*

* Im concerned my ex is coaching our daughter to say she doesnt want to stay at my house. There have been a few things she has said that leads me to believe this.
* Im worried about exs mental state and the effect that is having on our daughter e.g. her picking up on the anxiety. She has had some tantrums lately, I just try and be there not making a big deal about it all and making sure she knows I love her.
* My plan is to be a stable and safe place where she is always welcome and loved. Im listening to more Janet Lansbury podcasts while I wait for the book to arrive. This is giving me a lot of material to work with.

**Shit to Own:**

* Used porn again to feel better  not sure if I should focus on cutting this now. Its not a huge problem and Im focusing on other things. Long term I will need to at least run periods without it.
* Still think about the relationship sometimes and indulge myself here. Second guessing my decision, thinking how maybe I could make it work etc.
* Scared of being alone.
* Not sure where to go next with my development. I have had that feeling a lot and will just keep pushing and see where I end up.",1

3280,3281,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

Intro

Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. 

Body

>Good seduction competently follows Mysterys attraction, comfort, escalation model and so lay reports tend to get repetitious. Im much more interested in the principles of game that you can use repeatedly to get ongoing results than any one particular story.

>Knowing the underlying principles means you can get repeat results. Recently I pulled together a threesome with my main girl and a new one I met, and taking RPDs excellent advice I wanted to write this lay report to crystallize for myself what I did right while my thoughts are fresh. I intend to do more of these in the future.

There are a number of takeaways

>Set the frame from the first time you meet a girl that youre a sexual, non-judgmental guy. Plant the seed with women you date as part of your sexual dirty talk that a threesome would be fun for you and her to enjoy together.

>When pitching the actual threesome date to a girl you dont know well, be indirect. Instead just suggest another friend joins for a drink or that you hang out at your place. Give girls plausible deniability.

>Threesomes take even stronger leading than a normal 1:1 date. You as the man have to lead the girls through the entire process.

Conclusion

Threesomes are fun but tricky.

6134,6135,"and now, a real dessert coming up for you straight from god from the bible.
(romans 1 - new international version) ...... ""for since the creation of the
world god’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been
clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are
without excuse.  
  
21 for although they knew god, they neither glorified him as god nor gave
thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were
darkened. 22 although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and
exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like a mortal
human being and birds and animals and reptiles.  
  
24 therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to
sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 they
exchanged the truth about god for a lie, and worshiped and served created
things rather than the creator—who is forever praised. amen.  
  
26 because of this, god gave them over to shameful lusts. even their women
exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 in the same way the
men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust
for one another. men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in
themselves the due penalty for their error. furthermore, just as they did not
think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god, so god gave them over to a
depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. although they know
god’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not
only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice
them."" .... and this one, you can put wherever you want ....... who said that,

Thing is, during that time, that month, i had a gut feeling something wasn't connecting... So big lesson is, your gut feeling is almost never wrong.

 One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. 

Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation, she chocked . 

I wasted, college fucking and my time , but that is alright. I cry not. Things are looking good for me past school, i have had offers coming in, now i am just picking the one's with high value.

412,413,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

3570,3571,"I moderate a large subreddit. Some time ago, we decided to stop letting people use gendered slurs entirely. No bitch, dick, or pussy. No whore, no slut, no man-ups, no man-child, no fuckboy. The results were the following: 

* A lot of people got mad about the policy (and still do)
* Everyone got nicer
* All the comments got more constructive
* The amount of whining about the gender double-standard went way, way down and people focused on these specifics of the situation. 

I honestly didn't expect this to work. Never in my dizziest daydreams did I think this would have much of an impact. But it *did* have an impact. I've actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why that might be. 

I think that when people use a gendered slur as shorthand and then you take it away from them, they won't rephrase it to the exact same level of vitriol because they don't necessarily mean *that thing they said*. When people stop being able to ask, ""Am I just being a bitch"" and have to ask the question another way, they typically don't go to the most derogatory counterexample. Rarely it is rephrased to ""am I just being angry and controlling for no reason"". They have to clarify what they think being a 'bitch' means, and that could be controlling, manipulative, assertive, mean-spirited, cruel, or crazy. I might also mean a better meaning like, ""Are my expectations unreasonable?"" or ""Am I asking too much to expect that my partner ___"". 

The way people respond to those two questions is dramatically different too. People often will echo ""Yes, you're a bitch"" back, but they will answer ""Am I being unreasonable"" with ""No, boundaries are important"". Gender bias plays out in this situation like you wouldn't believe. People who are disinclined to support a woman who might be being a ""bitch"" to their partner (even if the specifics of the situation are the exact same) will support respectful boundaries, clear communication, and taking responsibility in the next breath. Similarly, telling someone to man-up is actually really unclear advice. What does that mean? What does one *do* if they actually want to man-up? A large percentage of the time, that evolves into ""Sit down and have an honest conversation about your feelings"" which, I think you'll agree, is a weird definition of ""man-up"". 

What I find is that gendered slurs usually are a short-hand for a complex and largely unconsidered pile of baggage that everyone means and understands in their own way. You can still call someone an asshole, a piece of shit, a cheater, a loathsome creature, an emotional terrorist. You can still say terribly mean things about people without using gendered slurs. You actually don't say much when you tell someone to man-up, quit being a pussy, stop being a fuckboy. When you ask 35 people a day to reword that to make it something else, you realize that no one is really communicating with those words at all. They are just thought-terminating cliches for feelings people mostly never consider.",1

4105,4106,"The Power Of Teasing - Building Major Sexual Desire In WomenWomen are not use to men rejecting or teasing them.  The hotter she is, the less likely a man has teased or rejected her.  As a matter of fact, if he has, this is the guy she finds the most intriguing.

""Why are you playing games with women""

This is a game that women play with men all the time.  When a man does it back to her, it disarms her.

I wrote a post called  [**How To Be Charismatic With Confidence Coming Out Of Your Pores**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/how-to-be-charismatic-with-confidence-coming-out-of-your-pores/) and it's with the elements I mention in that post and what I'm about to share with you is gonna give you an unfair advantage over your male competition when it comes to women.

So how do you tease a woman?  First and foremost, stop being thirsty to fuck.  Second, this is not teasing that goes nowhere.  The more you tease her, the more intrigued she becomes and the more she will keep you out of the friend zone.

Don't give a woman everything she wants.  When you give her everything she wants, she will start to get bored.  Keep your conversations short.  When the both of you hang out, she will enjoy your time so much more.  So if you only hang out with her for just 10-15 minutes at a time, the more she starts having feelings for you, the longer she's gonna want to spend time with you.

Her: ""What?  You have to leave?  You just got here!"" in a whiny voice.

You: ""Yeah.  I gotta go.  I have to leave for work tomorrow""

Her: ""Wanna spend the night?  I can wash what you're  wearing so you can have something clean for work tomorrow""

This is an example, don't expect this to happen exactly like this.  But you get the idea.  When a woman starts making accommodations for you to spend more time with her, she is doing what men want women to do when they ask her on a date.

Remember that women make time and switch things around for men they're attracted to.  The more desire you build up in her, the less resistance she'll have.  If she's suppose to hang out with her girls, she'll do it earlier or later to make time for you.

If you learn how to focus on building the desire in her, you won't have to worry about sleeping with her... she'll do her best to make sure that it's gonna happen.",1

4319,4320,"TRP was meant for Average Frustrated Chumps not Bottom Tier Omegas**Who is the Average Frustrated Chump?**

The average frustrated chump aka our beloved beta has had a semi normal childhood. They know how to talk to people and make friends. They have a friend group that goes outs and meets girls. The average frustrated chumps has gotten girlfriends in the past and knows how to flirt(albeit badly). 

Our AFC is a 5.

The purpose of TRP was to teach 5's how to improve their looks to a 7.5 and how to act like a player.       
 It also teaches men to take women off the pedestal. 

Go to the gym, fix your wardrobe , get an awesome haircut.

 Stop trying to be friends first.  Assume attraction. Kill approach anxiety. 

2-3 years of consistent effort and you can go from a 5 to 7. It works for guys with a decent starting point.

Another important note is that a 5 will see results faster. A wardrobe and hair cut can bring a 5 to 6. His friends will compliment his newbie gains. This postive feedback will motivate him to continue his journey.

**However TRP was never meant for Bottom Tier Omegas**

Omegas are guys who have no social life , no experience with women, are downright unattractive in multiple ways, and  are considers creeps by literally everyone who interacts with them. 


Our Omega is a 2. TRP welcomes all men with open arms and will try to help them. 

In theory TRP could work for them, but there no advice for guys who are starting from zero. 

How do you teach someone how socialize and flirt through a Reddit post? It's almost impossible.  


2-3 years of consistent effort and these guys will go from a 2 to 5. All that work to get mediocre women our AFC was running from . 

And these guys will see no fast results. Girls don't care if the obese guy has swag. Your newbie gains can't compensate for your social anxiety  . They get no positive feedback until they reach the minimum of 5. 


Any new trick or theory they learn from TRP can only be tested years after they see it. The AFC can test it out when he goes out or even on his GF/wife. Maybe an Omega can try it out some girl he's orbited but that's about it. It'll be months of improving himself and learning the basics before he can test TRP.

Even on the topic orbiting the advice should differ. If the Omega has literally one girl in his life, maybe he shouldn't ""next"" her. That's the only socializing with a girl he has. He should practice what hes learnt on her. Our normal beta can find another girl hence he can ""next"" her. 

You'd have to make an entirely new sub for guys who need to get from 2-5.  Then they can graduate to TRP.

**Here I explain the rise of the Blackpill**

The balding, 5'3,  Indian ~~janitor~~ programmer has found TRP. They've always been on Reddit. Reddit was built for these guys.  

This guy will be never be Chad. But TRP will give him hope. And he will be disappointed.  

The OG RP dude bros just didn't quite understand what they were dealing with when they tried to save Redditors . ECs would  tell them to talk to girls and these guys would ask how. ""What do you mean how? Just flirt like you usually do"". Poor asktrp ECs probably never realized they were talking to Omegas. 

Eventually the manlets, autists and  indians/asians realized that even if they did everything TRP said they wouldn't get the results of someone with a better starting point. 

Hence The BlackPill was born - Genetic Determinism the ideology. Some guys simply have lower ceilings.

Some guys will never reach 7.5 and get to date stacies and plate beckies.  Some guys peak at 5. 

""All that work just to be average? lol "" These bottom tier guys all denounced TRP and made their own subs. However one thing they  took from TRP was pushing women off pedestal. They did that perfectly.

This what ultimately lead to the death of TRP.  All the AFCs came improved and left, leaving the dregs of Reddit. The ECs struggled with the omegas who believed they had potential; who eventually graduated. And the omegas who felt they'd never make it  denounced The RedPill and took The BlackPill",1

I'm going to do what real men do. True story from the other day bro.

721,722,"My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.

It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.

The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". 

Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. 

I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.

TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",1

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**

women look for is a bald soyboy with a fat bank account that can afford the 20
layers of makeup they put on everyday and doesn't say shit on whatever she
does. feminism is cancer. i know there are feminine women out there and men

271,272,"Lack of romance and intimacy is NOT my biggest issue with inceldomIt's **bullying**. It still occurs to me at the age of 21 in medical university. People in general associate bullying with middle school when kids undergo puberty, but it still continues for me... 

I *wish* that my *only* problem with ugliness was the lack of success with women. I found many copes like vidya, movies, and dog to cope with loneliness. It's painful to be alone but it's possible to go on. 

But bullying absolutely destroys my mentality and will to live. It happens almost weekly. I've developed social anxiety, and depression. I cannot go outside feeling safe. I have missed all my lectures in the past 3 months and when I did go outside, I was met with more bullying. I cannot do my favorite sport, I can't even go shopping because I will be met with smirks and looks of disgust. This is the life of ugly man. 

*Who are the bullies?* It's mostly women - educated medical students that will soon become doctors. *What do they say?* Mostly ""eew"", ""hell no"", ""he is ugly""....

For instance, last Wednesday we had an exam. I was standing in line with earphones when I hear an ""eew"" and then 4 girls in front turned around and looked at my face with spite. How am I supposed to be confident? How can I become a doctor when I cannot look in people's eyes from bullying? FML. 

I am clean. I shower twice a day. I shave and have a professional haircut. I use Chanel. I ride a scooter. I care for my skin. I am super kind and friendly. I am fit (BMI 20). I wear expensive clothes.",1
