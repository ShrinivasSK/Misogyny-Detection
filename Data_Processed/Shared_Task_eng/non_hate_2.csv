**Physical**

Apparently my gym (24 Hour Fitness) will be declaring bankruptcy.

**Reading** Models, TRM:PM

Began working on the demographics exercise from Models - what am I? Who is in my sphere, my ""demographic"" and thus who might be attracted to me? Business women who travel 100%? That would be the woman who picked me up last year. Its still academic as NYC is talking about a July or August opening. As I worked on it a question occurred to me: Is wife in the demographic that would be attracted to me? Spoiler: no.

**Mindset**

Maybe it was due to being stuck with no female interaction other then wife, but I need to own the fail day I had last week that was off/on for almost the entire day: While reading thru a disassembly of some hapless n00b in the comments in askMRP I realized I've still got a lot of work still to do myself. PON helped me realize how tied up my ego is in ""being the victim"". And I've been working on the exercises for that. But I'm like Alex j Anderson's passive aggressive evil twin. I'm the unicorn that should not have been cheated on. I'm the only one ever to deal with an alpha widow, etc, etc. Each time I started down this mental spiral I was able to stop - for a time, but then it would sneak back in. The siren call of the self-pitying mope. On the positive side, I have the tools to deal with this, I kept all this to myself (at least I think I did), and I appear to have a ""floor"" that I can climb back up from. 

**Relationship**

It was pointed out to me in last week's comments that she's probably faking it: She's most likely still not attracted to me - she's doing it out of obligation, or to keep me from being Billy Beta Butthurt, etc. Was I trying to ""prove"" something? Be better than him? Am I keeping ""score""? I was for a while, but now I focus on what I feel like. I keep the pedal down on polarity and let it play out however it will.

Overall I find myself laughing at the pathetic loser I used to be, and probably still am. The day after that fail day I actually laughed out loud thinking back to it. What a waste of time that was.  I think that may be my mission: to just enjoy myself. Stop taking myself, or what she thinks, with any seriousness whatsoever. Instead just laugh. Too much other shit going on to get hung up on this ""relationship"" crap.",0

Believe me. I was one of them. I started to look at my own mental processes and condition myself to find short men attractive. Not gonna do that.

3655,3656,"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and
I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect.",0

If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to.

5718,5719,"great initiative. kudos. all sides need a voice to maintain balance of
judgement. but let's talk about most of the comments here that's like ' i take
this golden opportunity to give slippershot to feminists'. kindly tell me, are
feminists conspiring and encouraging women to file fake cases? how is this
even a logical inference.  
  
people hear about false cases and simply assume it's just women exacting
revenge or exhorting money. in reality, the reasons are so much more complex.  
  
majority of false cases (according to the delhi study) are filed by parents of
eloping daughters especially if the boy belongs to another community or
religion in order to end their relationship. and these cases were then deemed
false because of testimony of the girl involved.  
false cases with women doing out of revenge is really the least common type.
but people talking about false cases only zoom in on this type.  
  
truth is we don't really have much reliable post verdict data of all this.
there's only this one study that too conducted for delhi courts alone. we need
to press for more data and research of into this area (root causes) to amend
the rape laws in a way that's justifiable. one of the amendments i would
support is removing 'breach of promise of marriage'  
  
please understand increase in fake cases do not correspond to decrease in real
rape cases. according to nhfs and ncrb reports not even 1℅ of sexual assaults
even get reported. i have interracted with rape victims and inspite of all the
laws favoring women, victims still find it difficult to navigate the legal and
social system after a rape. they are very ofen shut up, threatened and shamed.
there's a systemic problem of underreporting of rape.  
  
often in an attempt to support false case victims, people end up undermining
the frequency and severity of rape in the process.  
  
it's a good thing, fake cases are coming to light and people are fighting for
justice where it's warranted. but a fight for more fair treatment of men need
not necessarily turn into a stupid fight against feminism.

5285,5286,"I see no-one but family IRL, but play video games with online friends who've never seen my face (and never will!)

It's nice, but once you see how much friendlier people are to you when they assume you're decent-looking you can never go back... Still worth it, IMO. 

Unfortunately, as you've probably realised, it's pretty much impossible to find genuine friends when you're trying. (Decent-looking people don't need to try, so never realise this LOL.) Best thing to do is try and improve your alone time, and dose yourself with bits of social contact (family, internet, etc.) for basic survival. 

If you're seriously desperate for some one-off social contact, talking about random shit in the Omegle spy question mode kept me above water for a long time. You just have to go through a lot of bots. 

(I do recommend video games though, it's a really good way to get ""back"" into socialising, since you only really need to talk about the game.)

Genuinely sorry you've been having a bad couple of days. I know how it feels to have no-one to talk to. Have you tried journalling? Something that gives me solace is knowing that, after I die, surely some creep will buy my journals on eBay and read all of them LOL, so I write to that person.",0

5021,5022,"I agree with you but let me lay out the problem as I see it:

The problem is popular advocacy wants the best of both of these worlds frequently. 

Oh this is a situation where men are outperforming without involvement? Lets redistribute the success! Equality of outcome!

Oh this is a situation where women are outperforming men? Well hands off! Freedom to choose! Freedom of association etc! 

The issue I have is when you are here defending things with freedom of choice and another person defends stuff with equality of outcome . Sometimes both are used by people who only care about womens interest and they either dont understand or act maliciously about how its discriminatory against men.

I would select equality of oppurtunity by the way. I am actually against Title IX existing, but that means I would want everything it affects including sports to be undone. I would like everything judged by that same standard.

The problem is we have lots of areas where we have redistributive policies which benefit women and areas where women have more rights and/or outperform that should arguably be distributed.

Some examples of redistributive equality policies that benefit women or tend to benefit more women: quotas, child support, Alimony, sports payment/scholarships, marriage/divorce laws, female only programs, gym hours.

Some examples where women have an arguably better deal out of it without any other intervening policy: child custody, paternity laws, womens scholarships, draft, #believewomen, dating, power of sex appeal, FGM/MGM, spending gap

You can also list some redistributed policies that favor men (bathroom lines based on same size bathrooms in public)

You can also add non redistributed policies that people argue should be redistributed (Pay Gap, job career choices gap)



I could add more things to all 4 of these areas. The point is that it is common to see freedom of choice arguements made alongside redistributive ones. (See advocacy for my body my choice and compare it to wage gap). However I look at all these issues and notice that redistributive equality and equality of oppurtunity get men shafted on both ends of it currently, frequently. 

I see current advocacy as using both standards, combined. This is no longer equality but a way to use equality as an arguement of convenience to argue for something above equality.

So, when I argue Title IX, its not because I believe Title IX is the best thing ever, but because I am pointing out the lopsided tendency of advocacy that argues BOTH Outcome and Oppurtunity...picking whichever arguement is convient.

The goal should be to pick one standard and work towards it. Instead we have the bastardization or arguing as advocacy for women by any standard that can possibly be used to support the arguement.

This is why I consider my flair to be the most important thing for advocacy in general. I am not anti woman or pro man.. I am advocating for a consistent standard.",0

4495,4496,"The Second Arrow  Currently there's an interesting AMA featuring Dr. Laurie Santos, host of the happiness lab. One of her replies contained an old parable I'd learned years ago but had forgotten till I read that thread. For those that struggle with self confidence; insecurities and negative self talk; this was her reply;

*Thats a hard one, as I incorporate a lot of the tips I share with my students from meditation to exercise to trying to protect my time affluence.*

*But if I had to pick one, Id say the most important insight comes from the fact that that we can control our reactions to the bad situations in life. Its an insight that comes from the ancient stoics but also from the Buddhist parable of the second arrow. Which goes something like this Buddha asks his followers if its bad to get hit with an arrow when youre walking down the street, which they quicky agree it is. Then he asks if its worse to get hit with a second arrow. All the followers agree that yup, getting hit with two arrows would suck more. Buddha goes on to explain that the first arrow is our of our control thats all the bad stuff that happens to us in life. But the second arrow is our reaction to those bad events whether we get angry or upset and make things worse. That second arrow is always up to us.*

*And so Id say the biggest insight thats had a positive effect on my own life is NOT to hit myself with that second arrow.* - Dr Laurie Santos 

During my teens I grew up with fairly high expectations. At the time I was expected to work, excel at studies and then contribute wherever else I was required. It's a gruelling weight to bear when there's so much expectation. I was drinking with my uncles and cousins one time and after relaying my woes; one uncle told me not keep shooting myself with *the second arrow*. He then told that same story. At the time I had a deep seeded doubt that the path I was forced upon; I wasn't up to. Insecurities, self doubt and my negative internal dialogue were eroding my confidence. Gaining that perspective however, then applying it; changed my world view. It irrevocably changed my frame. 

We all face adversity. Frame; and the base of its strength comes from a choice. We don't have a choice getting shot with the first arrow; **but we CAN consciously chose not to shoot ourselves with the second arrow.**

flocked in theaters to watch that film only because it got word of mouth
publicity for being the scariest movie of it's [time.It](http://time.it/) was
banned in several places but people still took buses to watch the movie in the
next town.The show 'Game Of Thrones', 'Breaking Bad' and 'Dexter' had a lot of
impact on people.They have fan clubs for superhero movies.A lot of people were
committing murders after watching 'Dexter' series.'Gone Girl' inspired a lot
of people to commit similar crimes.'Titanic' had that same effect on people

365,366,"Since no-one uplifts us, let's uplift ourselvesI uplift myself through self care. I take special care of my hair and I try different styling techniques, I try not to skip my skin care and I apply a mask on my face once a week (I feel very feminine , like those images of women with masks on their faces and slices of cucumber on their eyes  lol), I do my nails twice a month,  I remind myself to wear accessories because I feel so much better when I wear a pair of earrings or a necklace.

 My favourite part of my  own interpretation of self care and uplifting myself, are my me-parties. Usually on Friday night, since I don't go out, I have the best time with myself! I throw my own fashion show, where I try on clothes I don't usually wear  or I experiment with my clothes to create different styles, I do my make up, I dance by myself and I sometimes do karaoke. I also wear my high heels which I rarely wear outside! It's not like I am able to forget how undesirable and lonely I am, but at least I am able to have fun by myself!",0

5214,5215,"Be Like PeteI saw a post on the AskTRP sub yesterday. 

In it a man described stumbling upon on evidence that his LTR had cheated on him ruthlessly a couple years back. So what did he do? He dropped her instantly. Good move on his part. 

While I don't advocate snooping around emails and social media to dig up possible dirt I will say he did the right thing by confronting her and kicking her to the curb. 

However in his post someone dropped a comment titled ""Be like Pete"" and I clicked it. It took me to an archived post from 2016 on the Relationships sub in which a woman had posted that she got dumped for suggesting to her then BF that she was going to visit in an Ex in another country. 

[Read the post for yourself](https://archive.is/uULD2).. 

**Lessons learned:**  

\-Have abundance Mentality: Pete gave no fucks. He knew he could find another chick and didn't care about spending the last 6 months with her. It's easy to drop a girl for bad behavior if you have an abundance mindset aka the confidence in knowing you can easily find more woman. A beta in scarcity mindset would convince himself to keep a bad woman around for fear of being alone.

\-Never keep a woman in your life who would even suggest visiting an Ex. It's a huge red flag but she also tried to spin it on him saying he was abusive for not thinking she should do it.  

\-Men don't want to be friends with good looking women. She honestly thought her ex was just platonic and yet the moment she told him she got dumped he said ""great now we can bang."" (Paraphrasing that)

First, is anyone interested in joining a meetup like this? Also, anyone have ideas for locations? Here are the only location ideas I've thought of so far:

 Ask the Indianapolis Arts Center (seems like a stretch, but worth a shot)

 Transport the tables to a local park, like Broad Ripple Park or Canterbury (maybe by laying some portable table tops on top of picnic tables?)

3728,3729,"Good you think that as an individual, however, the point is that feminism as a movement doesn't. It also actively stops any progress for womens rights and mens rights that doesnt suit their agenda. When pioneering feminists opened up the first battered womens shelter (I cant remmeber if in europe or US) she wanted to opens a mens one and recieved death threats and rape threats by feminisists. When feminists authors did studie about domestic violence and were shocked to find out in some categories such as one way patner violence, i.e. not reciprocal women are 70% prepatrators, they received death and rape threats.

3422,3423,"Why are the caring loving fathers against their daughters being a housewife and dating an older man?If I follow the redpill ideology it says that the best thing I should do at 21, should be to stop going to uni, get married to a man 10-15 years older than me and be a SAHM. But my father was actually the one who wanted me to be an indpendant career woman, to have my own money, to study hard, and he say himself that he will never accept a guy whos more than 8 years older than me as a son-in-law. 

Hes not the only one, cause most of my friends that had a great relationship with their fathers seems to get the same advices which is studying, enjoying their youth, having their own money and then getting married to someone they love and theyre attracted to.

My uncle literally hated his daughters boyfriend because he was overweight and short, which means that men are not against women dating chads when it comes to their beloved daughters 

Especially that its funny how most men hate being judged for their career, but theyre the first to look down on their daughters boyfriend if hes jobeless.

5565,5566,"Is it just me or is it time to normalise non-invasive vasectomies the way we do IUDs? #ittakestwoBefore anyone gets defensive, lets break this down. Non-invasive vasectomies are...NON-INVASIVE. Theyre an outpatient procedure and after reading a lot about it, theyre compared to dental procedures that you can drive home from, and the worst part is the pain of anaesthetics. The only issue seems to be that vasectomies are harder (and completely possible) to reverse, and that insurance doesnt cover reversal (but they do cover vasectomies).

Now lets discuss IUDs. In a lot of countries, people who havent given birth aret considered for IUD procedures and some countries administer local anaesthesia. Im not mentioning it because I agree, but because of the implications of severity. Most women are given ibuprofen, which doesnt do much considering you have to push past the cervix opening (that is closed tight) with a rod to insert an IUD. For those who are having a hard time imagining, think about a hard rod being shoved up your urethra. 

As for side effects, where do I even begin? Constant bleeding for 1-6 months after the insertion? Weight gain? Acne? Fever and debilitating cramps after insertion? Severe PMS mood swings that border on clinical depression? Life threatening (ectopic) pregnancy? Irregular/heavy bleeding until its taken out? Increase risked of infections? Perforation (piercing through the uterus wall)? Extreme cramping with a copper (non-hormonal) IUD?

I am sick and tired, and frankly, disgusted, by the pressures put on women to be the ones responsible for birth control when it takes two to reproduce. And for the people who think: not my body, not my problem, you think paying for an abortion or child support is a risk not worth taking? Birth control comes with awful side effects, and do you know how stressful it is to take a pill at the same time everyday? Do you know what its like to make plans always having to consider that? Compared to a one-time non-invasive, outpatient procedure that has the highest rates of preventing pregnancy?

I see high school and college students taking responsibility and getting IUD insertions. Its about time we start calling out absurd double standards and placing responsibility on all participating parties.

Dear women, dont feel discouraged. Im iffy about talking to my male friends about this but what seems to separate the boys from the men is that while boys remain self-centred and self-involved, men understand my stance and even begin to agree with it.

I want to reiterate, Im not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves. Im here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them.

#ittakestwo

[Edit: I dont know if vasectomies are a viable solution. BUT...I would like to point out the discrepancy in the way we discuss what men might have to endure and what women have repeatedly endured. If theres such a huge burden on women, isnt it worth it to discuss and explore a variety of solutions no matter how bizarre they might seem before shutting it down completely? Are womens burdens THAT insignificant that we immediately shut down something that seems scary but may or may not be scary in actuality? THAT insignificant that we shut down solutions because the IDEA of it causes discomfort? THAT insignificant that possible pain takes priority of actual pain?]",0

Personally I get indulging a kink but this on top of a lot of the sexist practices of the industry... I can totally understand the view that its very problematic. Not everyone sees the difference between porn and reality. 

On top of that...  this is speculative really, but you know how in movies you get a bunch of disclaimers at the end? Nobody was harmed. This was a work of fiction. Nothing was harmed during the making of this etc etc. we dont get as many of those garuntees of safety, respect, and (for lack of a better word) wholesomeness in porn. Especially on tube sites where most of that is cut out anyway. For all we know what were watching is a sex slave and their abuser.

3150,3151,"About the double standards of Reddit (the ""what if we reversed the genders"" case)I'm mostly targetting the AITA and relationsip\_advice subreddits, there are many time where people say ""Just reverse the genders and people would react very differently"".

I agree with these claims several time, and it's very likely that there is an ""empathy"" gap where women get support or understanding and men don't.

For example :  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5xt2c/my_girlfriend_wont_let_me_finish_in_her_mouth/) is about a guy whose GF won't give him a blowjob (or won't let him finish in her mouth, the post is unclear) and almost everybody just tell him to deal with it and stop wanting it. While at the same time  [another posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5vcda/nsfw_my_boyfriend_absolutely_will_not_go_down_on/) about a girl whose BF won't go down on her get responses telling her to dump the dude.

I've also seen two AITA posts about a parent wanting nothing to do with their born child because they didn't want it when the pregnancy happened but the pregnancy was carried anyway:

You guessed it, the woman had tons of NTA saying she's not forced to get involved in the child's life. And the man got almost unanimously YTA saying that if he has sex he should be ready to be a father.(I wanted to put the posts but unfortunately one of them have been deleted and the second post's link was in the comments of the first)

I'm pretty sure that it has been discussed a lot, with many examples, do you have other links and examples ?

32,33,"I literally cannot imagine a scenario where I'd be watching content from this
channel, leave alone penning down a comment. I personally abhor this
propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times.
It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital
platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get
certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and
Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that
the news channels alone can provide.",0

3207,3208,"The way the concept of a patriarchy is abused genuinely scares me.
Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that ""Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world"" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment. 

You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world. There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues. 

The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.

The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.

I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.",0

3564,3565,"Thoughts about gender-related insults?A friend of mine asked me yesterday if I thought an email she'd written sounded 'bitchy,' and it got me thinking about this. The friend is a feminist, if that makes a difference. Her choice of words took me aback a little because 'bitchy' isn't used often among the people with whom I hang out. I don't use it myself, but due to a general aversion to profanity or otherwise harsh language rather than any concerns about sexism. Upon reflection, though, I thought that 'bitchy' actually bothered me a bit rather than just surprising me. 

*Is* it sexist? 'Bitchy' only ever seems to be directed at either women or people perceived to be acting in a feminine or effeminate manner. Relatedly, the insult 'dick' (which I also don't use, but again not for sexism-related reasons) is pretty much never applied to women. However, something being statistically associated with only one gender doesn't mean it's necessarily sexist. 

It's not like I'd tell my friend she should stop using the term, but I am curious about feminists' views on gender-related insults such as this. Are they sexist? Or does nobody really care? It's quite possible I only took note of it due to great boredom rather than any actual hint of sexism.",0

My biggest bit of advice is to keep one sling for your arm while exercising and wear another one normally. Youll get very sweaty so its good to have one sling designated for workout duty.

Back in the days, men would chase women and we were ready to do anything for you know what. Women would get annoyed by our horniness, and we would get accused of being only interested in sex. This is not happening anymore, and it is very distressing for women. It has considerably changed the balance of power. I have seen women in awe with my dick just because I could raise it, something which at any other time in history would have just been the normal. They would tell me of all their past dates that could not perform, and then they would just worship my dick and giving me anything I wanted just for being hard. Thats something I would not have seen 20 years ago. Sometimes, just being a bit bold and showing sexual interest is enough to get laid.

3251,3252,"So, just like rape culture, and the other things in this series, I'm going to make the same complaint. I think it's impossible to ""falsify"" hypergamy. I don't think it's something that exists universally in our world. I think there are clusters that have factors and pressures that make it worse than in other places (and vice versa, really) 

Certainly, I don't think every woman follows that sort of hypergamy path. Maybe most don't. I don't know. But I wouldn't say it's NEVER the case. Because that's obviously not true. And certainly, I've seen and heard about social pressures that actually serve to make hypergamy more expected behavior. 

I think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal. It's FAR from universal. 

Again, the best we can do is look at local factors. That's probably the best information  we can use on these topics.",0

2168,2169,"My improved posture has completely changed how men and women treat me in one dayI recently wanted to stop talking to women to focus on improving myself, and to detox, and very quickly, one of my self improvements was chest up, chin up and shoulders back. The look straighten my body from head to toe, and gave my vibe/look like one of those super confident attractive guys look that you rarely see. I have to admit, the results have been life changing.

This all happened last 48 hours

First off, a lot of women stare, and for much longer. The first women was on a date with a guy at a bar, and in-between small talk with the guy  I had to go to the bathroom. Well, there are mirrors that I can see him and his date as I walk away either direction, and all I saw was this guy's date have the most memorizing stare I've seen on a girl. Right in front of him. Nothing held back. Beautiful girl btw, but I'm not a terrible person, so I would never encourage guy hopping while on a date. The look gave that ""this guy is so interesting"". They haven't been dating long it turns out.

On the same night, a more heavy set girl and her friend stand behind me at the bar. I look behind me, and I see two genuinely nice smiles. I'm not into bigger women, personally, but I still found it really nice.

Next day at work, a female customer did a tripple take at me. One coworker checked me out from head to toe with a smile, and a 2nd coworker is straight up looking to rebound her break up by putting a lot of really cute effort into being close to me, and having me notice her. She does these really attractive/confident stare with a smile. Did a little small talk, but the sexual tension was so intense. I might actually be down for what she's looking for. I actually really liked her sway when she  walked passed me for no reason and then looked back at me to see if I noticed her. Her flirt was up to 11.

 last night, at the bars and club, another heavy girl flat out put my friend down because she thought he was ugly and I was attractive, and said she was down to fuck. That one pissed me off. So I shut her down by letting her know she's shitty. I leave to a new bar, and IMMEDIATELY, a wicked cutie hits on me which I assume is a one nighter she's looking for. I fucked that one up because I was so caught off guard, and ended up saying things that sounded like I was rejecting her. (Oops). I wasn't thinking before I spoke, so I ended up saying things that made her feel hurt.

Finally, my male friend straight up told me I was clearly a really good looking guy. This one felt so nice, because he's a really good dude, and straight men don't normally tell me that. (Bless you)

The rate of attention I got wasn't anywhere close to this before I decided to actually look confident. I also feel more powerful. I'm 6'4, and now look properly strong. Mentally and physically, girls and guy notice my vibe, and want to be around it.

So now it's day three, and about to go to work. And make the bar after. Based on all the attention with my new posture, I look forward to how people will treat me.

Update: at the bar right now. Haven't been looking around much, but have caught two 8s stealing glaces. One of them double takes and held the stare for a long time. Not sure how else to explain this shit.",0

- women becoming the face of anti-mask/anti-lockdown protests despite men being statistically more likely to not wear masks

If you are adoption behavior that isn't internalized but rather an act to attract women the more successful you are the more it reinforces the idea that the ""real"" you isn't desirable.

>TL;DR A girl I've known for a while, with some common friends. How to contact her and chat a bit, making your intentions of going out after the lockdown clear but without sounding like a sex predator or something?

I think this is something others are experiencing in this period too

So, there is this girl I kinda like, but we have a basic ""hello, how you doin'"" relationship since a while and haven't seen each other in months

Now, I'm thinking hell why not contact her, write a bit and polarize the thing, so when the lockdown is over we can go grab a coffee and you know.

I can see 2 problems:

\* I don't want to come off as creepy, contacting her now after months and we never talked much anyway. I really want a genuine connection

BUT

\* I don't want to come off as an uninterested friend neither. I mean, while I genuinely enjoy human contact and knowing people, regardless of everything, it should be clear that I am also looking for a more intimate thing, polarize it, that is.

I would just invite her for a coffee... if things were normal. But now?

Basic question you may ask me: why now after months?

Well, I'm a bit insecure and now I'm working on that part of myself, and also yes, I'm bored. And she is cute, and smart.

(Case in point, my teachers might have said 'women's access to professional work has historically been limited by law and stigma to lesser-paying roles'.)  Yet, if your partner is into statistics, and thinks that only the most comprehensive and up-to-date will do:

[https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap](https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap)  
""The controlled gender pay gap, which controls for job title, years of experience, industry, location and other compensable factors, has also decreased, but only by $0.01 since 2015. Women in the controlled group make $0.98 for every $1 a man makes.

New to the gender pay gap report for 2020 is analysis on the impact of lost wages on lifetime earnings. By calculating presumptive raises given over a 40-year career, we find that women in the uncontrolled group stand to lose $900,000 on average over a lifetime. Lost earnings narrow to $80,000 for the controlled group, but this is still significant, especially if you consider how lost earnings due to the gender pay gap would grow with compound interest if invested each year for 40 years.""

They matter, but only a little. 80% looks 20% personality.

Sure I agree with you. But most of the times people aren't equally good-looking in which case the better-looking guy is always going to win because personality won't compensate for looks.

>being a shut-in introvert your entire childhood puts you at a massive disadvantage in dating

How? 80% of rejections happen in the first 5 seconds of an interaction. You can immediately see the way a girl responds to you in the first few seconds if she's gonna let you flirt with her or not. If she doesn't like the way you look she's just gonna give you one-word replies, put on a bitch-face and have negative body language. Good luck flirting with that.

1027,1028,"Went to the bar on Valentines NightSo as the title says, I went to the bar on Valentines with my friend because Im a man looking to find a relationship or casual sex. Couldnt go into the bar because my friend forgot his ID. Classic. I decided to be a bro and stay outside with him and try to get lucky that way (I live in a big city so 1am hangouts outside the bar is a possibility). There were two instances where I had a chance.

1.) Theres this very attractive blonde girl about my height with heeled boots by herself on her phone. Time to shine. I walk up to her and say, excuse me! I introduce myself to her. She does the same to me. I tell her that I think she is a very attractive woman as well as that I would like to get to know her. She tells me Im very sweet with a cute puppy dog face and tells me that she has a boyfriend and that hes picking her up soon. I say thats okay and that Id love to be her friend, so I ask her for her number.

Que the boyfriend pulling up on a motorcycle and revving his engine for her to get on. She tells me thats him and I shake her hand as well as tell her it was nice to meet her and I walk away. About 3-5 minutes later I see the motorcycle drive off and same girl with other people hugging someone which appeared to be a friend, so I walk over to her and asked if she was just dumped to which she replies that shes just meeting him somewhere else. Looking back on that second encounter I feel stupid because I couldve said looks like I have a chance to get that number after all or something like that. Is there any other way I could have handled the second encounter?

2.) There was this other attractive brunette girl that kept exchanging looks with me, but I was too enveloped in a conversation with the group that I was interjecting myself in to go over there. Looking back I should have totally went over there for at least a moment. I was actually about to invite that girl into the group and she walked to the parking lot. How couldve I handled that differently?",0

I have to make some diet changes due to blood pressure rising again. Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast. I've acquired shoulder pain from having to substitute barbells for dumbbells in OHP. I had moved to dumbbells due to an unrepaired shoulder separation 35 years ago. Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy.

**Mindset**

After working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various ""victim"" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long.

**Relationship**

Wife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU. I had been doing ok with constant daytime banter and ""gaming"", but had to restart and rebuild after my incident. I had to consciously up the comfort, touch and praise.

I dont believe this is true.

I think society functions best when the base assumption is everyone is entitled to being loved, having sex and enjoying at least one relationship.

I find it alarming that in a culture where we obsess about the health and welfare of the environment and animal kingdom, we care so little about each other and our collective mental health and happiness.

The superficiality and cruelty that define the dating market should be beneath the type of people we believe ourselves to be.

Incels of both genders should have access to legal prostitution and both men and women should be encouraged to be less shallow and more generous in their dealings with each other.

So many people now end opportunities for happiness because theyre not getting 100% of everything on their list, mostly women.

This dull, checklist-style approach to dating sucks all the fun out of interactions for both genders and leaves many on the sidelines who are good people and would make good partners if others could just get over their superficiality.

In short, I think the current state of dating is sad, cruel and shallow, and the idea that only the most shiniest people deserve love is a big reason behind it.",0

I've had this one where I could save my crush in a quest, but some evil mastermind made it so that I'd have to die. He tried tricking us first but I figured it out and agreed still. Then I was sacrificed in front of my crush and some crowd, so they could be let go and live. I would think everyone hates me anyways so this is perfect, and in the end I get to see who I love last, which makes it an all around happy ending.

Sometimes I'd tell my crush to promise me to be happy, sometimes they would already have a gf, or I'd become a ghost and observe them being happy.

4075,4076,"Talk To Women - Keep It SiimpleDon't make the male/female interaction more complicated than what it has to be.

Eye contact

Greet

Small Talk

Farewell/Contact Info

Get out of your head, be in the present moment, and pay attention to your environment and the person in front of you.

Eye contact is how women convey interest.  If she locks eye contact with you, chances are she's interested enough to at least talk to you.  Master eye contact and you'll notice you're having more and more success with women.

Greetings are very natural and gives off a warm vibe.  Don't try to sound sexy or cool.  A ""good morning"" with good eye contact will get you better results than trying to be funny, interesting or cool.  Especially if you see the person frequently.

Small talk is when you can throw in your wittiness.

Her: ""Every time I see you you're drinking coffee""

You: ""So how long have you had your eye on me?"" said with a smile.

Don't expect fireworks, just observe her reaction.

Farewells don't require a hug or a kiss.  I know ""kiss closing"" is your goal, but you could kiss somebody today and she could be kissing someone new tomorrow.  It's not an accomplishment.  If you want to speak to her again, just get her social media info or phone number.  With social media, you can see what kind of person she is a little more.  You'll know if it has the potential to go further than a one-night stand or not if you actually do get to fuck.

4557,4558,"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 05, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

2360,2361,I crave for such intellectual conversations. God bless you sir.,0
4177,4178,"Short answer, yes.  


Long answer, I moved countries so I do not know if my experience is relevant.   I understand that my struggles and perspective are different from other people's and usually try to keep out of general discussions. This is not because I disagree with the principle but sometimes with the solutions. While feminism is a global movement, solutions need to take into account the specificity of local culture and history.    


If you are feeling alienated by feminists in your own country, then I think  your local intersectional feminist groups may help.

Meanwhile men have a laundry list of preferences, standards, and REQUIREMENTS for womens physical beauty. 

Some of their preferences are breast size/shape, nose size, WHR, hip width.

And the most common argument the short guys have is well you cant change height!! 1. You cant change the above things unless you are willing to risk your life, take time off from work and lose money, and drop >5k on implants or surgery, which guys shame you for anyways. 2. Why does it MATTER that you cant change your height? Ok? Should women immediately be sympathetic because you have an unfixable feature and start to have a preference for it? 

Its double standards. Im glad theres a feature for men to widespread be insecure about. Because women are picked apart and microscopically dissected for their features. Men dissect an oblivious woman walking by, with their friends as a social pastime. Its disgusting. 

Women, dont feel guilty for having a height preference. Men have just about every preference under the sun!",0

As per a report in the Hindustan Times, he was accused by a girl of molestation on social media, the police said. He was named in a MeToo post on social networking site Instagram. The post from the girl came on the day when the Bois Locker Room group controversy came to light, which has triggered nationwide outrage.

HT mentions an officer saying: No suicide note was found but messages retrieved from the boys phone showed that fellow students warned him that he will be questioned by the police.

Reports say that the police are investigating the deceased boy's alleged involvement in Bois Locker Room Instagram account. His phone has been seized and sent for analysis. The cyber crime cell has been looped in. His social media account and chats will be investigated to help understand why he took the extreme step.

The report says, ""The police official ruled out any foul play during preliminary investigation. The deceased has not left any suicide note. Further action will be taken only after detailed reports of his mobile analysis is received. As of now, legal proceedings under CrPC 174 have been initiated.""

As NCR fights against the Covid-19 situation, the incident involving a group of social media users on Instagram came to light. The incident, now known as Bois Locker Room incident, made news after a girl from South Delhi shared a screenshot on social media. The screenshot went viral.

The screenshot brought to light the activities on this particular group, where the users, as it appeared on the screenshot, showed school boys sharing photos of underage girls. The chats have shown the boys to have objectified the girls and to have planned 'gang rapes'.

Almost all the 21 members of the group have been identified. They will be examined.

Owing to the lockdown, the 15-year-old apprehended has not yet been produced before the juvenile justice (JJ) board, this report says.

The boy is said to have told counsellors and police that he was added by a classmate to the group during the last week of March.

After some days, they added a total of 51 people to their group and also made another group. Some of them allegedly started sharing photos posted by girls on their Instagram accounts. Some allegedly shared morphed photos as well, the Indian Express report quotes an officer saying.

And once in a while I stumble on a detail about game that I haven't figured out.

In my first year I went by the 'hell yes hell no principle'. Thinking that if women flaked or did any sign of disinterest I moved on.

But now I have more experience I start to notice that it isn't this straight forward at all. I had a date for example where the girl wanted to leave. I turned it around and had a f close. Same with reinitiating  contact. Girl doesn't answer texts says she is busy but 2 months later we still hook up.

I was far too negative. Having a short fuse to think women aren't into me by the first sign of trouble.

Ofcourse if a girl is bothering me with her behavior I let it go. But if I am less insecure about it I just try again and to my suprise I often get what I want.

So I am thinking about the double text.

We are having a fun conversation. About equal investment. And than it stops. How do you approach this?

I agree, women really need to stop bending over backwards. I dont mind somewhat shorter men that I keep that to myself (the whole debacle is turning me off men shorter than me completely tbh but I'm a femcel so what I like doesn't matter lmao). All I say is that women are allowed to have preferences and it's the only thing I'll say.

I hear men going on and on about ""petite"" this and ""petite"" that. Blackpeopletwitter loves to make fun of ugly women but bring up short men in that thread and they get mad.

The infamous angry short man who claimed he couldn't get dates lied. He even recorded one of his many dates where he abandons a woman in the snow.

It's a power issue, they're have to accept that they're not rich Adonis' that all women lust over and get a hobby instead.

818,819,"Pretentious Indie Game SimulatorHi folks, I'm just your average non-binary/genderfluid/trans/differently-abled/autistic/immigrant indie developer from San Francisco.  


The last few years of my life have been very difficult . People have called me mean names on the internet for voicing my empathetic and well-researched opinion on the benefits of veganism. I received so many death threats and dick pics online that I  wasn't able to focus on doing my job. I just couldn't manage to play and  review the latest AAA games for 8 hours everyday. I was very concerned  about my life and mental health.   


So I decided to quit my stressful job working as a part-time writer for a gaming website and moved back to my father's mansion in LA. It was very hard to go back to a  life of solitude after having being used to the chaos of San Francisco.  


While  I lived in LA, I had the extremely difficult job of catching up on all the backlog of games that I had reviewed at my last job without playing.  Through this I discovered something about myself. I discovered my passion for copying other people's ideas and passing them off as my own.  


I knew what I had to do. I had to make my own game. It was literally the only way I could make my voice known.  


I  felt validated when my first post about the game got over a thousand likes. I was so proud that my amazing idea resonated with my 15000+  followers on Twitter. I knew I was onto something special when all my game journalist friends retweeted all of my 74 blog posts about how difficult it was to learn RPG maker to make this game. The idea was so  great that I managed to get the game funded without any sort of  marketing at all! It just goes to show that a good idea is all you need  to really create hype around your game.  


I'm proud to reveal that  I've spent the last 7 months of my life working on my magnum opus. I've put up 3 months of wages on the line into buying the assets for this game. I work on the game all the time. It is so hard to manage with my offshore programming team due to time zone differences. When I'm not streaming obscure 80s DOS games in my pajamas from my bedroom, I am either engaging with the game's backers or trying to explain to my programmer who barely speaks English that I want the game to use a  custom game engine to build the world's most high performance and cross-platform visual novel.  


I like to make games that express how I  really feel inside. I like to express myself online because I can't do that in the real world due to my repressed, shy, and introverted personality.  


This game recounts the first heartbreak in my life when I wasn't asked out to the dance by my high school's quarterback and instead had to settle for a linebacker. It also deals with my childhood's most traumatic horse polo incident. It recalls the liberating feeling when I and my ex-girlfriend simultaneously got our third abortion. It tells the story of a fish out of the water, ignored, who jumps out to discover that the sunshine is just an illusion perpetrated by the capitalist patriarchy.  


This is my story. This is my voice. This is my soul.

6516,6517,"First of all - with all of our kids I was a mess for a year. I had issues with hormones and PPD coupled with not sleeping?  I was an absolute wreck.  My husband took nights on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) so I could actually sleep.  Do you absolutely have to keep pumping? Can you supplement with formula? 

You really need some self care.  There is nothing that says you never get a break just because you are a mom of a baby. In fact you really, really need a break.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  I realize theres a quarantine on and I dont know where you are - but even if you can go get a coffee and sit in the car with a book for 30 minutes.  

The thing is you have a ton of things going on here: you have an infant you is still at an age that is fully dependent on you.  You probably arent sleeping amazing. You are isolated because of a quarantine (along with the stress of that). You are essentially doing this alone (with some help from your husband).  

The infant is a full time job that never ends.  The house and being a homemaker is a full time job.  There isnt much time for leisure and building up your empty stores (you cannot pour from an empty cup).  Figure out what you need.  One day a week of sleeping in?  3 evenings where you can take a bath? Going out to get coffee? Calling a friend?  I cant answer the question for you.  But what you ARE doing isnt working.  Be specific and then tell your husband I really need sleep and I need one full night of sleep a week.  How can we make that happen? Or whatever it is that you need.  YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM FOR NEEDING THIS nor are you a bad wife.  You, my dear, are human.  

If after replenishing your stores you still dont like things that you used to enjoy - please talk to your doctor about it.  You could have Post Partum Depression.  

A couple of books I really like : Replenish by Lisa Byrne 

Say Goodbye to Survival Mode by Crystal Paine

The transition into motherhood is a hard one.  I feel like as a society its supposed to be this 6 week - all the weight is gone, baby is sleeping all night.  Its okay that you arent okay right now.

Edit-cant believe I forgot this! My advice to all new moms (especially if you are struggling!) is to get outside as much as you can.  I realize it may be hard.  But if you can put baby in a stroller or a carrier and got for a short walk that can make a world of difference.  Even just sitting on the porch or a park bench can be very refreshing instead of being stuck inside all day.",0

I always sensed she was after his money or has minor daddy issues) and he was sad about it of course. My coworker also told me that my boss is very picky about women, hence why he's a single old man with two daughters.

> Once Anna sought a divorceYou know what my lawyer called him? A parasiteshe, like many other women in her position, was in for a shock. Divorce lawyer Harriet Newman Cohen explains, The law is supposed to be gender-blind. Therefore, when a marriage is breaking up at the insistence of either the breadwinning wife or the supported husband, the lawyer has to apprise the client that when a big-earner wife comes in, the court bends over backward to be gender-neutral, and it is possible the bum is going to be rewarded for sitting on his hands. You do a flip-flop and make believe she is a guy.

4836,4837,"How I succeeded in datingAfter reading a lot of hoopla on inner game, flirting and other BS that there is out there, I came to an undeniable conclusion that most of these were full of shit. Sure, you could learn something of value from there, but most of it BS. So, I started using my common sense and got success.

I started working out. Not just because I wanted to date hot girls, but because I wanted to improve my health. This after having a fatal hospitalisation due to liver swelling. I improved my diet, which was now balanced and vegetarian. I did eat boiled eggs for breakfast though. And, I started working out. Hired a trainer and started finally. There were many points in time where I simply wanted to run away from gym and sleep in my cozy bed. It was painful, but worth it in the end. Now, for a year I have not been sick. Not even a cold.

Secondly, I started visiting a good barber. I can't emphasise how important is having a good hair cut. After getting my haircut, I kept going to the same since it is important to go to the same barber for maintaining a good hairstyle. I have specs so I bought a stylish pair of eyewear.

Thirdly, I improved my fashion sense. I started taking my female friends for shopping my clothes. If you want to attract females, better ask them what suits you. Besides, they have a much better fashion sense than males.

Meanwhile, while executing all this, I started socialising. Like just going out there. Started chatting up any girls that I liked. Initially, I had nerves. I was frantic, nervous. But gradually I started gaining confidence. I read somewhere that when girls reject you, think of it as their loss instead of yours. Initially, I will be honest, I got depressed upon rejection. It shattered my confidence, but I kept at it. I had to. And eventually, this benefited me. I became desensitised to rejection. Whenever I got rejected, I got a bit sad but moved on. 

Then after some time, I finally got success. Hence my confidence increased. But a big part of it was me getting fit. I cannot emphasise the importance of what being fit did to my confidence. No longer had a pot belly. No longer was I skinny. So I would say this, going to gym and being fit will boost your confidence enormously. You do not need to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Just be fit. Muscular. Don't go overboard with it, lol.

Another thing that has kept me happy in the relationships is:-

* I do not dip my pen in crazy ink.
* No games. No push pull. Be genuinely busy. Develop constructive hobbies. Develop interests. Be an interesting person for the sake of living fullfiling life. Not to get chicks.
* Never pursued a girl that was playing games. I have my self respect intact. No girl is worth losing it. I have a rule about dating. If after first date, the girl does not herself ask for another date or start a conversation, I consider it to be the end of it. Never drive single handedly. After some time if a girl is not reciprocating, or is confused. I tell them to make up their mind.
* Be forth coming once you start dating about what you want. No pussyfooting about what you want. Do not be friends if you are attracted. You will end up suffering.
* Do not be manipulative. Do not put a nice guy act. Girls can see through it within seconds. They might end up using you and then dumping you before you get anything.
* Do not stalk. Do not be pathetic. No means no. Develop a thick skin and learn to move on.


tldr:- Use your common sense. You do not need a love guru or a dating guide or any other BS.",0

**Stats:**

Age: 46(m) 39(f) Together: 10 years. 3 kids.

Height: 5.9'; Weight: 180lbs

SQUAT: 207lb BENCH:198lbs OH PRESS: 114lbs DEADLIFT: 229lbs, all x5

BF: 20. 8%.   

**Read and thoughts:**

Steel's Guide to Married Red Pill (and down the rabbit hole on all links), need to reread.  

WISNIFG  Learnt a better way of communicating, I am not anymore the conversation finisher. Letting the hamster DEER is better than confronting it.

MMSLP  Got horny just by imagining doing all the things there. Shit, I need to lift now.

The rational male Year One  Oneitis, plates, game, hypergamy, frame so much wisdom there.  

NMMNG - I understood I have been a nice guy for life. I learned to listen and to be more assertive during conversations. Listen more.

The Game - it was an insightful book. I was expecting a guy bragging on how easy he picks up girls. I read an inner trip with lots of useful reflections.

Steel's Guide to Married Red Pill  It will be a long journey for a career beta like me.

MRP Beginner's Guide for the Career Beta  I want to read again in a few months and be proud of how far I have gone.

Currently reading: not really reading, just latest posts in MRP and askMRP, I have too much things to do to catch up with my goals  

Reading queue:

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius  I kind of like stoicism. Getting worried about mundane things is like when a small baby have a tantrum over a random toy.

The Mindful Attraction Plan (stalled)

Book of pook (stalled)

Audiobooks:

TWOTSM  I followed HornsOfApathys advice and I am listening to audiobooks while training. Book is inspiring, too deep/god focused, maybe I am still not ready, but I am enjoying the explanations.

**Myself:**

Confinement. Routine. Wake up. Kids tasks. Cook. Work tasks. Food. Train or not. Projects or laziness in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Hey, I built a wall. No, not an emotional wall you feelings-porn-seeker, a real one with bricks and mortar. For being a first time I feel really proud. I build things. I am a man now.

For the DoD challenge, I keep working out, diet is not soo bad and of course I shower and shave every day you disgusting faggots! Keeping house a bit better, but I need to do some tasks none of my children (including wife) feel responsible for. They will. Because I will guide them.

I have been busy with myself. Changes and habits take some time to settle, so I did not feel like writing weekly. It might sound like an excuse, but I did not want to repeat myself. Still, from time to time is good to write down to keep the pulse (and get some kick in the ass from wiser men).  

I own that I need to improve with the kids. I could be better and schedule better and be stricter and plan better and guide better but they are kids and are trapped here, so I let them slip a bit from schedule and be kids. Still, there is room to improvement and I will go for it. A bit stricter in the mornings and more playful in the afternoons, that will be me.

Time is scarce due to the fact that I am supposed to be working and dealing with kiddos at the same time, and this is not possible. So I work afternoons after wife comes back from the job.

I am still searching for my mission. By listening TWOTSM I had to stop lifting for a few minutes and list all the shit I like to do, I want to do, and there are a lot of things, but no real legacy yet. Nothing tells me go for it, they are still a bunch of long-term things I want to do. I will choose some things and see if it brings me to a better sense of mission.  

**Current goals:**

* Reach 1000 lbs club: deadlifting heavy is the best feeling I have in life. I cannot explain it but if I had to do a personal record or fuck, I would go for deadlifting (iron oneitis?). Max 1RM theoretic calculations put me in 800. I will try when it says 1100.
* Play guitar. And sing. I will be a rock star. Yeah I also dont believe it, but it is fucking fun.
* Be consistent with my working, training, household, etc. I need to put it as a goal because being the best me is part of my mission.

**Relationship:**

I am surprised on how unemotional I have become regarding my relationship most of the time. No, really, not angry anymore, no fear or whatever. I was over-sensitized lately and jumping at every bone. I somehow dont care about many things that would have had me angry and emotional regarding the relationship. I kind of see shit tests and am sorry, what?, you expect me to react to that?. Old me would DEER and whine and justify and make things rational and explain and prove and try and on and on but new(TM?) me is kind of whatever IDNGAF. And the best is that I mean it. My relationship is still really important to me, but the explosions/situations of the moment are not interesting me at all.  

Too much shit to do to be bothered I guess I am now at 80% of the time with this attitude, 20% resentment. This 80% is not rambo, it includes  initiating, relaxed attitude dude this confinement has been a blessing in disguise for me. The 20% are still my insecurities and fears and still being angry for not getting the treatment I deserve and fuck the noise, I just STFU and it disappears after some time. I am kind of relieved I am not in the emotional roller-coaster anymore.  

We are still not talking about us, but I am not sure I want to taaaaalk anymore. We share time together, play with the children, have some interesting non-relationship conversations, watch some serial together, pair of sexy times a week (I want more, and I dont get butthurt when rejected most of the time)... a standard blueish relationship. If she is fucking around or hiding things/lying is her fucking problem, fuck her (I still have oneitis, so I am trying to fake it until I make it). Not where I want to be, but far better than before. I take my time for myself and she is not the center of the universe, the center of the universe is again that marvelous land called Fraggle Rock or me, better me.  

**Lifting:**

\#60DoD  Weights are improving. I was lying to myself in the first OYS about my weights, this is where I though I was. Well, I was not close, I injured myself because I was too proud to lower the weights and do proper form, recovered and now my lifts are where I really am, proper form and at a minimum x5. I am fine with that and getting in a good shape.  

Doing Phraks Greyskull LP Variant and adding some shoulder and back exercises alternating days, plus some abs.  

Still a bit of fat, but I look better in pictures than two months ago. I had not decided in my last OYS if reducing body fat or going for increasing strength. I will go for the strength, I felt miserable when I tried to cut calories. And the mirror shows me a better body now, so even at the same BF% there is a huge difference.

**Diet & habits:**

I feel better and more energetic when I eat in a surplus. I will not go go-mad, but will keep calories high for now.  

I stopped cigarettes completely. They are disgusting now. Weed is reduced to evenings with wife, but I am also cutting that from last night (not even a goodbye joint, I stopped already). I dont drink, so I will go back to weed for recreational purposes, but I need at least a full clean month before considering that for now.  

I have enough rest, but I am not sleeping my 8 hours. I need to schedule myself better now that I am really doing things.  

**Financial:**

We share expenses. No change here. I started to do projects with the computer. Nothing that can create money yet, but the skills I need to build them will put me on the right track.

**Social:**

With the virus outbreak I am isolated at home with the kids. That is making social interaction scarce. Some video calls at work and with groups of friends, but they are not the real thing.",0

The problem is that there is a lot of people in the field of gender equality which are only and exclusively advocates for women.

You can see how begrudging some of these schools were to allow men (into programs named for girls) simply so they could continue their agenda.

The problem is the mindset and goal is wrong. We cant even evaluate statistical inequality without looking at other things such as women making up 60 percent of degrees in masters programs. Just to point out how big that difference is and there is no school addressing it.

Also, I agree that STEM gives out harsher grades and there might be some difference either social or biological that causes that to affect women more. It could be because of inflated grades given for other subjects or if one sex is used to failiure more often that they perform better when failiure is a higher risk. However, we cant get to that conversation because people are trying to balance out percentages, but only ones they feel are discriminatory or that affect women.

It says:

*How do we not lose hope in finding love? How do you tell yourself that the right guy will come along when you don't really believe it? Why do you not believe that it could happen for you? Regardless of the insanity that we see out there today, love happens. People get married. People move in together. These things happen all the time. You don't have to be young, or beautiful, \[rich, famous\], in shape, enough to offer, or have a good credit score. If love happens for this one or for that one then it is possible for me. Whatever we have lived up to in our past, it does not indicate our future. You may want to revisit choices that you dismissed in the past.*

In the comments below the video, you can find an excerpt from the the despair of women over 25 (and certainly over 30):

*Im 46 years old and it has never happened for me.*

*Its really hard to believe love can happen for me when I have been waiting for so long. Its been 12 years since my divorce, and I am losing hope.*

*It has been 20 years since my divorce.  I've been with several dating agencies, and only had a couple of short - term relationships which have never lasted beyond a few weeks/months.  Just one that lasted about 15 months, but he turned out to be an alcoholic.  I've had a couple of dates just recently, but all he wanted was a friend ""with benefits"" .  I will be 70 this year so just want someone who will prove his worth before anything like that happens.  I'm not as confident about my body, as I was years ago.*

*Im a very affectionate caring loving women aged 35 , men tell me Im attractive all the time.  But I meet a guy we start to date , we get on great he says hes so crazy about me & finds me so attractive & caring and with in a few weeks( longest being 6 mths )the man says he doesnt want commitment & has no feelings for me . This has happen to me about 20 times over the past 15 years. So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it.*

*Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?*

I think that the lesson for women is quite simple.

Either they find a husband while still in their prime age, or else, they will soon end up in a desperate situation.

Of course, that does not change anything on the male side, which first and foremost may want to stay away from the gynocentric court system. So, if a woman is young and pretty, she may still be able convince a younger man, who at that point is still governed by his hormones, to ignore his red-pill lessons and sign up anyway, for a stint on the plantation. Older women are mostly toast, while the video tries to give them hope that they are not (but they do not seem to believe it, really).",0

1357,1358,"[Repost] Unattainbles - A Core Element of Masculinity**tl;dr  won't usually do this for you, but this one is easy**

Simply put: In order for a man to be happy and at peace, he must have a presently unattainable goal.


------


Let's jump right into it. Your personal deficiencies are going to be very different from the other guy (and your past self as you grow up and evolve). To expound on the second point, what I cared about at 17 was of the utmost importance to me at 17, but has no relevance to me now. Likewise, my expectation of achieving the goals I set for present-day me would be outrageous at that time.

That means in plain English that my mission in life at 17 was as follows:

* Graduate high school
* Hold on to the relationship with my girlfriend

My unattainable at 17 was:

* Get into my ""dream"" college  

When the unattainable is achieved, something new must take its place. **Failure to do this creates existential agony until an appropriate obstacle is in place to calm that nerve once again**. What do I do now when I achieve what felt like the unattainable? I invent a new unattainable. However, this lesson took some time to learn.

My college mission was as follows:

* Break up with high school girlfriend
* Make grades
* Rush the fraternity I wanted to be in

My unattainable at the time was as follows:


* 


Yep, nothing. This is where my journey stalled. I never bothered to think past my last unattainable into a new one! After all, I had already done the impossible. I was perfect and needed no further improvement in my mind.

I briefly got back together with the high school girlfriend long distance. It was, as my football coach put it, an ""other than positive experience"". See the problem?

----

This applies to men of literally any age. I use a teenage example because it will resonate with boys and men alike, but the message is the same: whether your limitations are sex, money, power, wealth (believe me, that is different than money), or fame (a thing many people hamster into attaining the other 4 aforementioned), you need to understand that without some seemingly unattainable goal to strive for you will never continue to be a man.


The core act of being a man involves becoming a different man worthy of surpassing self-defined milestones. The unattainable should be a combination of ""a thing you've never done before and have limited hope of achieving RIGHT NOW"" and ""things men you admire and respect have done before"". 

Fortunately for our dear readers, many are probably major losers right now. This unattainable can be as low as ""kiss a new girl"" or ""earn a promotion / earn $46,575 a year"". THIS IS A GOOD THING. Your self-actualization depends on actually achieving these goals, *just not in your current mindset, body, or frame.*

For the avoidance of confusion, your current mission should be:

1. Specific
2. Measurable
3. Attainable
4. Relevant 
5. Timely

Your current unattainable may or may not be any of these things - you have the freedom to decide. The only requirement is that the unattainable must be grand enough that you are currently unworthy. Hold yourself to this principle, and you will evolve rapidly into the man you want to be.",0

If a girl seems interested when you text her, but then leaves you on read after a while, understand that its either this, or in all likelihood, you arent the only guy she is talking to. (Shocker, I know.) I dont typically entertain girls who send one word replies, and then leave me on read after a while, in fact, Im usually the one who leaves the girl on read at this point, but if she is generally engaging, might be worth playing the long game. The best advice I can give though, dont double text on the same day, thats a mistake I made for a long time, and it was impulsive. It also helps to have them on multiple platforms, my last girlfriend for example, I finally got a first date with her through the Instagram DMs, and the rest is history.",0

I don't think politics should be removed from games, because you are forcing particular narratives to be silenced. 

And my particular viewpoint is that any kind of story and political view can work in a game, if the game cares to actually be a good game.

Story-driven games need to focus on the stories itself, and not being preachy. Games can't sacrifice what makes it fun for the sake of a narrative.

I dunno I'd like to think that if someone made a more awesome version of Dynasty Warriors but made it of any particular political viewpoint I'd be against, I'd still play it.

2094,2095,"Withdrawing A Guilty Plea Before Sentencing?Please excuse if this question has been answered before. I am new to reddit and don't have much time to help my friend who I believe has been pressured into pleading guilty to a crime he does not believe himself guilty of. I will refer to him as David here, however this of course is not his real name and I will not provide any identifying details even if asked.

David is considering trying to withdraw his guilty plea, for the following reasons:

What happened:

1. Five minutes before his plea was due, whilst at the court, he was told the prosecution had completely rewritten the description of the charges against him, to which he claims to be innocent of and has much proof of.
2. He was told by his solicitor he 'will' be found guilty of the new charge by a jury because they will all hate him and ignore his evidence.
3. He was told he will not get 1/3 off his sentence if he does not admit his guilt right there and then. He was told it would be expensive to defend himself and that pleading guilty will save everyone a lot of money.
4. He argued with his solicitor that it did not feel right but minutes later they were called to the court room.
5. As he walked to the courtroom with his solicitor he was told again he should say guilty when asked.
6. Just before he was asked to plea the judge offered an adjournment of a few days to allow defence to consider the rewritten charge, however his solicitor declined the offer without consulting my friend at all.
7. During the plea itself the defence solicitor mouthed plead guilty multiple times at my friend as he hesitated.
8. The rewritten charge arbitrarily changed the period of the offence from a couple of months, to a whole year and included additional un-provable claims not stated before.
9. Later he was told that he could put in a basis of plea setting out his version of events and disputing certain accusations that form the charge. The basis of plea was then submitted but the CPS is saying they will not accept it because it was not agreed at the time of the plea hearing.

In addition to the above, David is suffering from chronic depression, officially homeless, often suicidal and very, very vulnerable at this time. As a result, he is very easily influenced and due to the nature of the charges, finds if very hard to argue his innocence without people saying he sounds more guilty by doing so, or he is minimising the offence.

IANAL but from my understanding of both the evidence and his explanations. I do not believe him guilty of this crime, although I admit I may be biased and it is a complicated case. He is in a really terrible place at the moment and I want to help him as best I can before what I believe is a miscarriage of justice occurs.

Please could someone advise how he might go about asking to withdraw his plea, if this is even possible given the circumstances. His own solicitor has threatened to resign from the case if my friend tries to change his plea now, leaving him undefended with very little time to act before his sentencing.",0

3860,3861,"> more likely to commit crimes

If you ask sociologists, it's about being more likely to be accused and sentenced for crimes. Also something about discrimination in the first place, and less verbal and social skills making them have more difficult time to defend themselves against accusation. Some will go on with religious beliefs about patriarchy and toxic masculinity.

If you ask evolutionary psychologists, it's about status and access to women, in other words men committing crimes for the benefit of women or for their positive attention.

Regardless, even normalized for the same crimes, out of the accused, men are disproportionally more often sentenced than women and out of the sentenced ones, they're getting harsher sentences than women. Men are also less likely to get any help and are discriminated against by the police when they're victims of crimes. It goes on and on, and the OP of the crossposted article has plenty of good sources, also see the bonus sources chapter.

All in all, the society is rigged against men in various ways, which makes men discriminated against in almost any aspect of society.",0

Maybe I'm not the person you would want to advice you, but when I would be about to lose my V-card and that girl asks me that question, I would say the truth. If she's comprehensive, I'd try to make her enjoy that moment, but if a LMR occurs, it doesn't matter, there will be more girls who find me attractive. 

I've also read Models some months ago, and I noticed an improvement as I was starting to kiss some girls after 3 years and a half of not doing that, until we were locked-down. I still have to apply some lessons from the book. I'm due to read also No More Mr. Nice Guy!, but I can't as I have some workload and I don't find the moment to read it.

6188,6189,"There is a ""blind leading the blind"" belief in this sub that's hiding in plain sightThat belief is the ""Don't be friends with the girl you're attracted to otherwise you'll be stuck in the friendzone"" belief.

The reason I know that the people who push this idea are ""blind"" or really, inexperienced or just don't know what they're talking about, is because for most of these people, if they have a girlfriend and she's friends with this cool guy and she always hangs out with him, they recognize the possibility that she could cheat on them with him.

But why would you think that she could cheat if befriending a girl supposedly keeps a guy stuck in the friendzone?

Or do the ""rules"" somehow not apply to that guy but they do to you? 

Friendship doesn't put you in the friendzone. 

The friendzone comes as a consolation prize from a girl who rejects your sexual advances and it is also sometimes a way for the occasional girl who has issues to manipulate and take advantage of a guy.

Its not your friendliness that puts you in the friendzone. Its the lack of a girl's attraction for you that does.

You can be that cool guy that all the girls want. Don't listen to blind people who project their own insecurities onto you.

4917,4918,"With such people making such remarks, it is always interesting to ask then why, if such words are so critically important that they denote sexism (which is so incredibly linguistically illiterate it's astounding), is their movement named after women, which clearly must also be a sign of sexism, and everything they fight against, from patriarchy to manspreading, manterupting and toxic masculinity, is named after men. Aren't such words also likely to be internalized harmfuly by young boys the way ""mankind"" is going to be internalized harmfuly by young girls?

Of course all of it is neglecting the fact that the ""man"" in mankind was the term representing a human being, and has to do with the hand (""main"" in French, same root as manual) at the time where male humans were referenced as ""wereman"" (like it is still in werewolf) and female humans were referenced as ""wyfman"".

It can be argued that the disparition of the ""were"" in front of man has more to do with the fact that men are only valued for what they do in society, hence their unique role being fused with the ""hand"", the ""man"" that is used to describe a profession (like in fireman, policeman).

To argue that the ""man"" in English word refer to men and is sexist is illiterate, and also (ironically since it is feminists we are talking about"" completely American-centric. It forgets that there ever was other languages than English, and that English has shared and borrowed words from all sorts of languages, including in large parts Latin and French. 

It is as incredibly stupid as ""we call it history because it is his story"", when in fact, it comes from historia in Latin (where ""his"" isn't a thing) and it is more likely that the word ""story"" actually comes from a deformation of ""history"" than the other way around.

There should be a ""Tactics"" flair for these posts, versus ""Theory"" posts.

I never had trouble, generally speaking, with confidence.

Even little Beta shit like saying ""sorry"" when I bump someone at the store. It all had to be shed, but it also had to be replaced with something.

And for me, anyway, it was finding and implementing the right *tactics* in place of all the bullshit that I was filled up with. So it's great to say ""do not give a fuck"" but how does that actually look in context.

What I find, much like V. reports, is that women will resort to overt communication if you're just nailing the tactics:

And the fact that we often feel alienated from the discussions in our home as well as overseas is because we dont take multitudes of lived realities into account. Even if we do, we dont hear much about it and its often exoticized and seen as something bizarre  in the West. Its so frustrating because women from third world countries are assumed to achieve the feminist discourse in the West. The cultural nuances are completely disregarded. The collective voices of women from the third world heard. There is need to engage with lived experiences of multitude of women from diverse cultures and classes. Patriarchy affects us all but it affects some more disproportionately than others. Feminism at the outset should account for this.

Diet goal is to hit sub 15% BF during the Time Of No Lifts

Hygiene: I had already been brushing my teeth, washing my face, feet, and ass before finding MRP. I have now cleaned my living space and am going to keep it organized and orderly, I let things pile up over the last few weeks while I've been prioritizing work and fucking around with girls 

###Mental

If I don't put me and my responsibilities first I will end up right back where I started, possibly in a worse place. It needs to be where I'm not chasing pussy, pussy is chasing me, and I give it the time of day on my terms and on my time, when my shit has actually been owned, and I have time to spare that I want to spend enjoying the company of a woman worth my time.

The external validation is like meth, extremely addictive, and it had been so long since I've felt a woman's interest, it was like being a first time user. In some ways I really am. On some level I knew all this, yet was weak over the last 2 weeks and indulged anyway. I'm coming down off of the validation binge now, and settling into what I said I needed to do last OYS: a more manageable amount of time spent on plating. I'll continue to step down my time commitment over the coming weeks, and continue working on identifying when I'm interacting for their validation (don't do it) and when I'm interacting for my own enjoyment and giving my time freely without expecting something back. 

###Family

Still not spending as much time as I was here before plating, makes sense, you can only do one thing with your time at any given moment, I can't read 48LOP as a bedtime story to my 3yo, nor can I be at home with my kids if I'm out on a date, or at work, etc. 

###Financial

Saving a lot. Stimulus came in, saving that too. 

Bought some new clothes in prep for Style week of 60DoD, this should finish out the cycling of my wardrobe that I've done over the last 6 months, it will be piecemeal from now on, cleaning out old/stained things and replacing those with new ones. 

###Professional

My temporary assignment is nearly over, and the permanent promotions needed to free up that position for me haven't happened yet. They did extend me in this position though, another month. No matter what I'm in so much of a better position to take the next similar opening that its not even funny. I killed it over the last 3 months and everyone, I mean everyone, knows it. 

###Social

Been having fun on my dates. 

Fucked Property Manager again, this time without the Nice Guy backdrop - I just did what I wanted, came, and that was that. Didn't worry about her at all. Spent a total of an hour at her place? Doesn't really matter. I wanted to fuck, so I did. 

Date 2 with Nurse is tomorrow. She said maybe at first, so I asked the next day ""is it a yes for you, or should I put that time back out on the market?"" Her ""Woooow, you are cut throat"" I said, my free time is valuable to me, we can hang out next week if it isn't good for you, just don't leave me in limbo. She said ""Got it"" and agreed to the date. We are doing a private Happy Hour at a secluded spot I picked out. 

Date 2 with Diver is a maybe, this one is a good learning opportunity for me, she's super assertive and independent, and I'm sometimes not sure how to respond because of it. She talked so much that I don't have to say much. We agreed to a plan, and when I texted to confirm the day before, she reneged but offered to reschedule to the next day. So I told her to come up with the idea, and once she had decided and suggested it I put a plan together to make it worth my time and fun for me and gave her a part in it. That plan she followed my lead and completed her assigned part quite well. Internally I focused on not reacting to her having so casually altered agreed on plans and staying positive and fun instead of getting offended like a faggot that she didn't do what I wanted when I wanted.

Date 2 with Physical Therapist is a maybe. She's smart but kind of full of herself, maybe takes herself a little too seriously. 

Date 1 with Server who shit tested is later this week. 

Out of the 4 I like Nurse and Phys the best, they are the most fun to be with, but I'm keeping the pipeline moving. Lining up 4 more girls, but not taking so much time with any of them as I did the first batch. I'm learning.

###Marriage

STBX was pissed back in February because I sent our tax refund to my personal account, then transferred her half when it came in. ""It should have gone to our joint account"" - and now with the stimulus it automatically went to my account again  so she was upset again. So I told her ""You threatened to take money that doesn't belong to you when you overreacted to me putting the savings back in savings at the end of last year. I've shared everything we've received 50/50. Maybe don't make threats next time, and I won't feel the need to protect myself."" She tried to twist the facts, but I stood my ground, so she texted my mom a screengrab of our conversation . My mom told me she had and said I should be nicer... I told her to mind her own business. 

Nothing else significant... finally found a place still doing Notary work and made an appointment this next week to get the uncontested document Notarized, STBX will be there to sign. 

###Goals

Don't let on that I know about her indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (14 week streak)

Plating OPSEC (2 week streak)

Go to at least one Social activity without family. (3 week streak)

Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (9 week streak)",0

move on from someone whom he truly loved. They are separated because of the
prevailing stereotypes. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has studied psychology himself,
and he beautifully presented a story about a brilliant and intelligent
surgeon’s downfall and his resurgence. The scene where he doesn’t want to
plead not guilty because his professionalism is the only thing his father
respected about him is very emotional and brings out the good nature of
Kabir/Arjun.

Read: MRP sidebar

Reading: Saved MRP Posts

**The Break:**

I took a break from the sub for a while. It was recommended by more experienced guys. I couldn't see it at the time but I was clinging to MRP like a life buoy.

**Mindset:**

I am confident that the work that I am doing is compounding. I can see how I celebrate too early. Instead I will use those times to recalibrate. There is some learned helplessness masked by distractions that I need to deal with.

# MAP

**Physical:**

The home workouts are going well. I will work faster at the gym when it reopens. I will use current frustration to fuel more workouts.

**Money and Material Wealth:**

The work I was doing before the pandemic is steady. It is more demanding. I will systemise more and dedicate the time to new opportunities. That is what I am going to focus on for the rest of the month of May.

My best cash ooportunity is via my creativity. I will set up sales channels for this with the time gained from routinisation.

I am a maker. I can make and manage production teams. The review and reorientation process is my least favorite. This because it doesnt feel like making. This effects my earnings and options. I need to incorporate improvement in these phases into my money and management systems.

**Comfort:**

The comfort I gave myself recently is a few drinks at the weekend. What I am masking is dissatisfaction. I have cut out the weekend drinking to force myself to define what I want more specifically.

There is resentment in the lack of looking after myself first. Previously I have either over battled or bailed. Again the need for calibration raises it head.

HOA made a comment to the effect You cant create for someone what you havent created for yourself. Well...you can. But it is not good. Weve a saying where Im from, The cobblers children go barefoot. Enough of this.

To be congruent you have to build your frame for yourself, not on the promise of favorable outcomes. 


**DHV:**

I was advising on National projects for my countrys response to Covid-19 this coupled with my busy work life, home workout and OYSing has taken on an extra positive halo during the 'crisis'. As the kids say, Im glowed up. But its because of the theatre lights.

This adds to dread. Her compliance is increasing and harpiness is decreasing. The current situation is demonstrating to my family and network that I prepared for this type of work reshuffle for years.

This is resulting in more efforts to keep me and some shitty comfort tests. I have reread some of J10's posts on Shitty Comfort Tests and managed them accordingly. 

I have some residual resentment about AWALT. I will channel this in lifting. And into reflecting on my personality and preferences.

In addition I have been coasting in the sunlight that comes from not being an autist during a pandemic. 

It's time to up my game and take advantage of the free roll Covid has given many of us.


**Personality and Preference:**

This is emerging more. I am making the space to express my preferences by better planning and taking the time to reflect. 

**Sex:**

The sex is always there. I get it when I want it. It's enthusiastic. I'm not here for that anymore. 

There are things I would like to try in bed but it's not a priority. More precisely, its note a priority with my wife in her current body shape. Her tits look great and BJ performance has improved through more nuance and demonstrable hunger. 

The only game i am running is asshole game combined with push/pull and healthy doses of stfu. It works fine at the moment. I could add kino. 

Oneitis is dead but willingness to Nuke the Nuclear Family isnt in play yet. I could do it but would I? 

Early in this process I would have said yes, but anger would have been the fuel. I may say 'yes' again soon and improved preparedness will be the gate to that transition.",0

When we realize that dressing well communicates that we give a fuck, are worth it, and have the self-awareness to do all this - well, then we don't want to be seen in our shitty sweatpants, even when we're just home with our families. (instead, I upgraded to tapered track-style cotton pants, with a fitted t-shirt in a solid color for 'pajamas').

4594,4595,"I dated a very successful woman and it was enjoyable. I also have male friends that would/have reacted the same way as you have described.

What worked for my relationship with the successful woman, is there was a sense of balance. Although she made more money than me. She'd ""allow"" (for lack of a better word) me to pay for things. I once had planned a trip for her birthday. I had bought tickets to a show and surprised her, but I hadn't purchased the plane tickets yet. We talked about it and decided she would pay for airfare and I would pay for the events, lodging, and majority of food. The trip was lovely.

Throughout the relationship we had made a deal. Whoever has the idea, pays. For example if she wants to go to breakfast, she pays. If I mention us going to a movie, I pay. Things like that. 

Although it isn't all about money. She also ""let"" me be dominant in the bedroom. It is important that men feel like we can be men. When a woman tries to stifle that or if we feel unable to provide. We end up lost.

There are many ways other than financial to provide for someone. The men you dated may have been intimidated/insecure of your success. But did you allow them to be men in other situations?

It's often small things. Letting us drive places, build things, take over in the bedroom, make decisions on what we do, etc. Even if you paid for majority of the things, we (men) need to feel some sense of control somewhere in the relationship. If you drive everywhere, if we always take your car, if you pay all the bills, buy all the food. It makes us feel unnecessary.",0

How fucking terrible do you have to be as a person to _actively revel in someone's misery_, especially when that someone has had nearly both himself and his wife die in short order?

It really concerns me that people have always been this awful and that social media has just amplified the capability of being a piece of pond scum.

So the arguments seems to literally be ""I disagree with some of the supposed messages of this anime, so obviously it being popular makes no sense"".

>The controversial elements might actually be a boon for the show's popularity. Some viewers may seek out Shield Hero because of its taboo, almost risque reputation, while others might even sympathize with the protagonist. **This would justify the show's label as an ""incel fantasy,""** but it would also explain why **rampant criticism has failed to break the show's viewership.**

Weird how someone who might empathize with a character being wrongly maligned and mistreated by powerful social elements might not react positively to criticism revolving around how it's apparently *morally wrong* to ever portray a woman abusing societal expectations for personal gain.

There's a few limp-wrist complaints about generic anime tropes thrown in, but its pretty easy to tell the driving reason this dude hates Rising of the Shield Hero is because it was declared guilty of wrongthink for having an evil female character do something an evil female character would do, but those damn incel anime fans kept enjoying it anyway.",0

You  are going to grow up so, so resilient in ways that these kids will not.  It hurts and I know it's barely any comfort, but honestly, you are  going to be /so/ prepared for the knock-backs in life. You're having to  claw your way into recognition and being taken seriously - what happens  to these pretty people when that starts to fade?

One  of the biggest lessons I've had to teach myself (more due to abusive  father/controlling dynamics, but same theory applies) is to be  warm-blooded, not cold-blooded.

Cold-blooded  people need constant validation from those around them - they seek it  to warm themselves, they're always yearning for what others can give  them. Warm-blooded people find validation and comfort within themselves,  they understand their value and radiate with it, they don't need  outside comforts or input.

Focus  on your own personal goals and you can still have a great life. I live  alone in an apartment right next to work and it's a dream come true, I  work in a field I'm passionate about and have so much spare time to  pursue my hobbies. I'm taken seriously because I've had to force myself  to be, and people know I definitely got where I am based on  achievements.",0

3867,3868,"Why do so many women tolerate and even encourage casual sexism from their friends/boyfriendsI am a woman myself. I was sexually harassed by a guy in my campus and the entire incident was caught on CCTV cameras, so when I reported he was suspended but got off without any punishment by using a legal loophole in the campus rules.

Knowing this and the existence of this proof even having seen it themselves in some cases, I still see the same women becoming his friends and hanging out with him as if it's totally normal. 
He never apologized he denied the whole incident and then went ahead to spread rumours about me being a ""characterless"" woman, who was drunk and delusional.

Not just this, the popular girls here the ones that are considered nice and you know not problematic or feminist like me, are usually the ones who allow casual sexism, laugh at sexist jokes, and basically appease men. I have tried hanging out in these groups or been forced on several occasions, and I've been put off by the huge amount of shit that these girls are putting up with. And when I bring it up they make excuses and they say it's how boys are.

I'm sick and tired, I've never been able to have female friends, just a couple of them. I'm tired of the normalisation of this behaviour. Why would any woman play against her own team, why would she support molesters? Why are they so scared of even trying to understand what feminism stands for?

Feminists dont expect men to  lead the revolution for womens rights, so why do men (like the one described above) want feminists to lead the fight for mens rights? We can be allies for each others cause. This doesnt mean feminists dont advocate for men because we do; I make it a point to also address the inequality that men face. But I prioritize women issues & mainly address womens issues because I am a woman and it directly affects me.

Also, to answer OP, people want to justify their behavior by pointing out a nonexistent double standard. They want to believe that girls wouldnt be reprimanded for the same behavior & thus, they are being unfairly targeted. But either way regardless of gender, its wrong.",0
