Im embarrassed. It was pathetic and I feel awful that I was so entitled and put so much standards on women, that theyre supposed to be perfect, and one should come along and save me. Disgraceful. 

Women are flawed, and there are bad ones - that doesnt mean they arent beautiful. I have to start seeing women as individuals. Respecting them and respecting myself. 

I probably will never get laid, as I havent done so already. Im not that special, girls dont have to date me or have sex with me. Rather than being bitter about it, and blaming women - Im learning that my mindset is harmful to me and those around me. So, Im content with never having sex or being with a girl, thats their choice to not want me: however, I will love women, not be so entitled and pathetic, and have a healthy mindset for MY happiness. I feel quite good about myself now :)",0

6152,6153,"@jin #4289369 no one is born gay. if you'll look into it deeply you'll know
its a satanic agenda promoted by elite satanists in hollywood,the music
industry etc.. i've heard it from actors and singers themselves. being a
supporter of gay rights opens the gates to accepting of worse sins like
acceptance of satanism. us gay laws were passed in 2015, one year or 2 years
later, satanism is made an official religion in us and they've built a statue
of the baphomet right in front of the 10 commandments. also it's really funny
how we are called bigots when in reality, you people support public nudity in
gay parades, and how you can support legal pedophilia (kid drag queen, desmond
is amazing, danced in a bar with dollar bills thrown on him by nude and semi
nude gay men) also we are called bigots when preachers are assaulted by gay
people on a regular basis. seriously, gay pride parades are nothing more than
public pornography. for those telling me to stop hating, first answer the
above questions. also its illegal to mispronounce your gender,or to get into a
debate with gay people,yet its perfectly legal to mock our lord jesus. several
gay celebs and gay people have mocked jesus on national tv,yet that's not
called hate. also christians don't hate gay people, but rather the sin of
homosexuality. no one is born gay,its a demonic perversion. i've talked online
and debated with members of the lgbtq community,none of them are able to
answer my question. also i've had several encounters where those people show
sick pornographic lgbt images(some loving community huh) just for engaging in
a debate. i've heard testimonies of people who used to be part of the lgbt
community, actually calling it a horrible sin. the theme of lgbt is pride, but
mainstream media which is controlled by satanic elites in hollywood and the
music industry have made us forget about god. ever wondered why so many
homosexual pedophilia takes place in hollywood? its because high ranked
directors and celebs have sold their souls, and pedophilia,rape, molestation
are ways of indoctrination into the higher levels of this society. lgbt is an
agenda supported by satanists,whom you think are atheists. its a prophecy in
biblical texts. even pope leo xiii had visions of what's to come for this
world. he saw satan telling god that he's going to control and influence the
world in the 20th century,in those visions,satan showed leo xiii visions of
war, abortion, demonic possessions, and yes homosexuality! and this vision
happened over 130 years ago,and its true. the 20th century had more deaths in
wars than all the other centuries combined,sibs became virtues, pornography
becomes so popular almost all people have seen it one way or another,
abortions have taken place in such a way that the number of dead fetuses could
fill an ocean, homosexuality becomes supported even more than christianity.
the world we live in is made to believe that god and satan doesn't exist, but
its a high level agenda done by the freemasons, kaballists,shriners, and
illumunati. they control mainstream media,they are in nasa, cia, fbi and any
government places. if you've read till here, i humbly ask you to first answer
my questions before ignorantly calling me an idiot or bigot or anything of
that sort. else, i'll consider you as a foolish ignorant nutbag who is simply
stupid",1

5346,5347,"Your identity catches up to your actions and vice versa.We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore our habits shape and create our lives and our identity. Our identity does the same in reverse.  

When you decide upon improving yourself, whether you start by eating healthier, working out, cold showers...
you should aim for attaining an identity of someone who eats healthy, who works out, who takes cold showers, not necessarily the act itself.

This is so because, our ego is our biggest factor of motivation for keeping or developing habits. If you perceive yourself in a certain way, you will subconsciously strive to do what makes you remain that way, which is why breaking bad habits is so hard. You are comprised of them (good or bad) 

Most important thing to keep in mind is to have patience and not get discouraged by not seeing immediate results. If you workout once, twice and so on you have to keep doing it until your identity catches up to your actions. When your identity catches up and you are a person who works out on a regular basis no strings attached, then it becomes automatic and requires little to no willpower.

Also don't get dissapointed if you for example have developed a healthy habit of working out, but can't seem to do work/study consistently or whatever else. Each habit requires it's own growing and nurturing, but a carryover effect is real.  Make your life a rolling ball of compounding quality healthy habits and don't go in all at once, start small.",0

412,413,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

yes, men can be and are victims of sexual abuse, harrassment or rape too.. and
not necessarily at the hands of a woman. add false accusation to that list and
this is something that everyone needs to be aware of. just like a woman who
was a victim of a sex crime, men who are falsely accused go through hell too.
it amazes me that some women can get so low and falsely accuse someone of a
sex crime when there are so many actual victims fighting a losing battle. and
just like a lot of actual rapists or abusers, these women seem to get away

Rookie: pick her up from work and when you see the guy, just give him a stare. Say nothing. Give him a handshake and crush his hand during the handshake. Say ""is this the fat faggot you were telling me about?"" This path is a little insecure but if fatty is a pussy he will fuck off

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time. If she is chasing your validation she won't give a fuck about her faggy coworker. Flirting is fun and females love attention. If you're giving her too much attention it won't mean anything to her and she will seek it thru other sources. Dread game is goat. If she is jealous of other girls than she will be nervous and trying to please you.

The key stereotype of neckbeards is poor hygiene, if you want to break out of it then get that hygiene under control. Bad hygiene is something that people will unanimously judge you poorly for and for good reason, take that away and youre already leaps and bounds better off.

Step 2, start dieting and exercising. Quarantine is one of the best times to do this. There are tons of how to guides for heavier people who may have a hard time with exercising, itll show you where to start and build yourself up. Remember, its a lifestyle change not just a temporary thing. Its good for your health though, so it for health first and looks second.

Finding a job and working on social anxiety will be hard right now. For your anxiety that might require therapy, Im not a professional but it sound like you may have an actual anxiety disorder.

But my father was actually the one who wanted me to be an indpendant career woman, to have my own money, to study hard, and he say himself that he will never accept a guy whos more than 8 years older than me as a son-in-law. 

Hes not the only one, cause most of my friends that had a great relationship with their fathers seems to get the same advices which is studying, enjoying their youth, having their own money and then getting married to someone they love and theyre attracted to.

My uncle literally hated his daughters boyfriend because he was overweight and short, which means that men are not against women dating chads when it comes to their beloved daughters 

Especially that its funny how most men hate being judged for their career, but theyre the first to look down on their daughters boyfriend if hes jobeless.

4562,4563,"**OYS #4** 

Country still has no lockdown.

Stats: age mid 30, married to wife (mid 30), 3 kids (2, 5, 7). Height 5'9"". Weight: 76 kg (167 lbs). Strong lift 5x5, B 55 kg,+5 OHP 45 kg, DL 70 kg, SQ 90 kg, ROW 50 kg.

Still reading some of the sidebar, The Book of Pook, The seduction method. WISNIFG.

**Physical/training**

Finally got the form issue sorted with BP, hope to see more chest growth coming weeks. Compiled pictures of muscle development and see continuous progress since mid feb when I started. 

Got private boxing training from a friend which was great. Hoping to do this every week.

**Marriage/How not to do MRP**

Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good.

After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down  (crying and  asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed.

Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my  worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good.

Failings:

\- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit

\- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol)

\-  Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that)

\- No real OI when facing denial/indifference.

Success (I think)

\- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats.

\- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly)

\- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval)

\- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account"").

**Mental**

Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes.

**Sex**

After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz.   

**Family**

Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great.

**Social**

Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends.

**Week goals**

\- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success)

\- No losing calm at all (2 week success)

\- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend)

**Shit owning / Goals**

\- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue)

\- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week)

\- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot.

~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here.

~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though.

\- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame.

~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.)

\- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there)

**Mission**

*Not only star in the exciting film of life but direct it as well and make people want to co-cast.*

\- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle.

\- Be financially independent before 60",1

3655,3656,"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and
I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect.",0

* A lot of people got mad about the policy (and still do)
* Everyone got nicer
* All the comments got more constructive
* The amount of whining about the gender double-standard went way, way down and people focused on these specifics of the situation.

I think that when people use a gendered slur as shorthand and then you take it away from them, they won't rephrase it to the exact same level of vitriol because they don't necessarily mean *that thing they said*. When people stop being able to ask, ""Am I just being a bitch"" and have to ask the question another way, they typically don't go to the most derogatory counterexample. Rarely it is rephrased to ""am I just being angry and controlling for no reason"". They have to clarify what they think being a 'bitch' means, and that could be controlling, manipulative, assertive, mean-spirited, cruel, or crazy. I might also mean a better meaning like, ""Are my expectations unreasonable?"" or ""Am I asking too much to expect that my partner ___"". 

The way people respond to those two questions is dramatically different too. People often will echo ""Yes, you're a bitch"" back, but they will answer ""Am I being unreasonable"" with ""No, boundaries are important"". Gender bias plays out in this situation like you wouldn't believe. People who are disinclined to support a woman who might be being a ""bitch"" to their partner (even if the specifics of the situation are the exact same) will support respectful boundaries, clear communication, and taking responsibility in the next breath. Similarly, telling someone to man-up is actually really unclear advice. What does that mean? What does one *do* if they actually want to man-up? A large percentage of the time, that evolves into ""Sit down and have an honest conversation about your feelings"" which, I think you'll agree, is a weird definition of ""man-up"". 

What I find is that gendered slurs usually are a short-hand for a complex and largely unconsidered pile of baggage that everyone means and understands in their own way. You can still call someone an asshole, a piece of shit, a cheater, a loathsome creature, an emotional terrorist. You can still say terribly mean things about people without using gendered slurs. You actually don't say much when you tell someone to man-up, quit being a pussy, stop being a fuckboy. When you ask 35 people a day to reword that to make it something else, you realize that no one is really communicating with those words at all. They are just thought-terminating cliches for feelings people mostly never consider.",1

Those men issues are also very important, but if those men you describe reallly care about the problem, they will address it & try to solve it independently. Yet in my experience, men who bring up male rape victims as a dismissal of female rape victims are the ones who laugh at prison rape jokes & shame male victims as being weak. 

Feminists dont expect men to  lead the revolution for womens rights, so why do men (like the one described above) want feminists to lead the fight for mens rights? We can be allies for each others cause. This doesnt mean feminists dont advocate for men because we do; I make it a point to also address the inequality that men face. But I prioritize women issues & mainly address womens issues because I am a woman and it directly affects me.

I had access to her mail, so i easily got into her Facebook... 

Checkin wassup, found, some hooking up in 2017(in college) with several guys that year. And it was said to be our best year together. 

Thing is, during that time, that month, i had a gut feeling something wasn't connecting... So big lesson is, your gut feeling is almost never wrong.

 One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. 

Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation, she chocked . 

I wasted, college fucking and my time , but that is alright. I cry not. Things are looking good for me past school, i have had offers coming in, now i am just picking the one's with high value.

In my home country, I come across as 'ultra-modern', and in my country of residence, it took me two years to exactly grasp what 'subtle sexism' as opposed to 'overt sexism' looks like. I find it difficult to discuss my issues in the feminist groups I've been part of - their solutions would not touch on the nuances of culture that I experience. 

Online, Reddit as a whole is very US-centric. What has helped me was to join some women-centric groups from my home country - these are not naturally feminist groups, but they give a sense of relatedness. I also follow some accounts on IG from the expat communities. This helps me feel that I'm not alone in my struggles.

Aren't such words also likely to be internalized harmfuly by young boys the way ""mankind"" is going to be internalized harmfuly by young girls?

Of course all of it is neglecting the fact that the ""man"" in mankind was the term representing a human being, and has to do with the hand (""main"" in French, same root as manual) at the time where male humans were referenced as ""wereman"" (like it is still in werewolf) and female humans were referenced as ""wyfman"".

It can be argued that the disparition of the ""were"" in front of man has more to do with the fact that men are only valued for what they do in society, hence their unique role being fused with the ""hand"", the ""man"" that is used to describe a profession (like in fireman, policeman).

To argue that the ""man"" in English word refer to men and is sexist is illiterate, and also (ironically since it is feminists we are talking about"" completely American-centric. It forgets that there ever was other languages than English, and that English has shared and borrowed words from all sorts of languages, including in large parts Latin and French. 

It is as incredibly stupid as ""we call it history because it is his story"", when in fact, it comes from historia in Latin (where ""his"" isn't a thing) and it is more likely that the word ""story"" actually comes from a deformation of ""history"" than the other way around.

**Take responsibility for your little prison of flesh and everything else will fall into place.** 

Today was the first day of this pandemic that I felt like it wasn't going to be easy.

In the rare occasions I feel down I tend to think ""Welp that's it, I feel like shit and I have no control over the situation so I guess I'll just feel shit until I don't.""

I know, fkn helpful huh.

Thankfully I've been working on this and a lot more. So after a long day of things just not going my way and my overall state of mind not helping I recognised it was time for a good ol' meditation. I have found that taking a breather can go a long way.

So there I am all zen and shit when I allow my mind to wander a little so I can figure my shit out.

I asked myself what might be one of the oldest questions: Why am I not happy right now?

Well idk I've been taking care of myself. A couple weeks ago I started taking workouts far more seriously (thanks TRP) and doing some yoga too. But hmm now that I think about it such a change in lifestyle can temporarily make you feel drained of energy. I have also been eating well than before BUT HMM now that I think about it I skipped a few meals in the last couple days. And I did (make a conscious decision to) relapse from NoFap today. And yadayadayada

Huh, it makes a whole lotta sense my brain isn't giving me happy chemicals, even tho just a few days ago I was thriving in almost the same routine. I've been on autopilot, haven't I?

So I considered all my past experiences on this contentment subject and looked for the exact things I haven't been doing.

Surprise surprise, it was nothing I didn't already know subconsciously. And yet I had it so perfectly laid out in front of me that I wrote it down and stuck it in the window in front of my desk. Call it a dogma for contentment:

&#x200B;

>**Only by letting go of vices, practicing good habits, and looking after our mind and body,**  
>  
>**we can expect to appreciate life and know what we need**

&#x200B;

""But a disciplined life without dopamine seems so boring!""

You'll be surprised to find how fulfilling it becomes. Not only it's far easier to find contentment, but you also know what you want in order to be happy. 

More specifically, you are more aware of what your body and brain need in order to stay tf out of your way.

Let me break down my experience:

1. **Let go of vices** \- I was doing NoFap and getting laid consistently so I had to make a smooth transition. Space out masturbation and don't fall into porn. Weed (which is everywhere in my social circles) also tends to make me lazy and can get me down. Social media, youtube videos with no valuable content yadayada. 
2.  **Good habits and looking after yourself** \- Exercise, yoga, meditation, staying in touch with people, watching a few sunsets and adding variety to the day through a hobby.
3. **Appreciate Life** \- The day goes by faster, you enjoy the simple things, you feel fulfilled and in the right course.
4.  **Know what you need** \- By going off autopilot and cultivating mindfulness you don't fall back into old habits and you notice what you need as soon as that need arises.

Thank you for reading. Honestly, I wrote this more for myself. My state of mind can be quite volatile, which probably isn't the case for most fellas. But I hope it helps someone. Also if there's any grammar mistakes or incongruencies: English ain't my first language.

It's amazing the emotional roller coaster that you go through once you do have kids to take care of.  I never imagined it possible to love anyone as much as I love these 2 little guys.  As a man there is a much deeper sense of meaning in your life that is discovered once you're a father and you would literally die for your kids without even thinking for a second.  The responsibility to take care of them and provide for them makes life so much more meaningful and fulfilling and that in itself provides a deep sense of purpose and happiness that I didn't know was possible.   This doesn't exist in a life where your only purpose is immediate gratification and pleasure seeking.

5543,5544,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

-Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)**

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.  Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue.

^2  Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever).  Dont over plan.  

^3  Mild condescension is ok.  Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.  Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid.  Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.",1

3419,3420,"Ooook, so, let's begin.
1. There is a difference betweet starving because of commies and capitalism. In capitalism, you have a real canche to get out of poverty, in commie, no.
2. Commies also start wars so, no strong point there. Taiwan? Tibet? Butan? Hong Kong?
3. Your ""propaganda"" is not real. China is solely at fault for Corona. Look at their culture. They eat dogs, cats, bats, koalas, snakes, etc and thet try to eat it as raw as possible because it is considered healthy. Well, that backfired, did it not with Covid? In this case: eating bats is not a good thing. Some cultures are better than others.
Still on propaganda: I can watch, listen and read pretty much everything in democracy, can even real Mein Kampf if I want, you can buy it but not in China.  Media must he aproved by the gov first, not cool.
The ""propaganda"" that you showed, it is in fact, reality. Sad to break your commie chinese love but reallity is reallity, just like TRP regarding woman. Get over the anger phase.
4. No, cult of personality is not raising someone as an example. Stop toying woth words, you start to sound like an SHW/Antifa. Cult of perso is when you are forcebly shoved in your throat a person. For example: Stalin, Hitler, Muso, Che, Fidel, the Kims of Korea, Hirohito in WW2, Mao, etc.
5. No, it is not bad, that's why we have universal free healthcare (at least in EU), free schools and colleges, police, firemans, housing program, car program.
People are not born and will not be able to be all equals, have same chances, this is by default. You might be good at math but I really suck at it, for real.
You might be bad at programming but I am a sharp tool in programming PLCs in Step7, TIA Portal and also designing electrical systems in Eplan. You and me are by default not equal. Equality in chanses, not really, again. Even with free healthcare, education and all, there can not be equallity. Stop this commie thinking please. Also, people do not like to be equals and the same. Not everyone wants a VW Passat, others want Seat Leon for example or Fiat.
Also, you want to be equal with Elon but Elon does bot want to be equal with you.
6 capitalism creates them naturally and by that I mean rich people just became rich because reasons. Commies just creates artificial rich people.
So you are a starter banker? If you are not in my close group of friends and not commie, nope, bye. The state wants you out of the elite plus you do not seems, subjectively, dedicated to the commie ideals.
Sorry man but you are really losing this discussion. Commie is bad for culture, humanity, science, etc. Whatever.
7. What other political parties are in China? Is there a liberal party? Conservatorist party? And I am talking in EU politic terms (USA is garbage with politics). Nope, only commies and if you do not vote commies, you are a bad, bad citizen, off to reeducation with you.
I am not in the USA sphere of thinking. We have opposition here that fights for it's causes. The democrat socialists were in power in Romania, they did terrible things and wanted to do more like pardoning people accused of corruption, fraud and money washing but the opposition managed to unite (liberals, technocrates, idk if i spelled it correctly, other socialist formation) and together with the people's protests, the social democrats felt. This is an example.
China? Nope, no opposition, no protests, nothing.
8 Yes, I am romanian and collectivisation left a huge wound and scar in our society and for me also. My grand grand father owned a lot of land that was productive, he was working it but when the commies vame to power, he was executed because he did not want to give hi's private property to the commies. After 24 years of commie downfall, my family managed to get back only 60% of our rightful lands.
No, collectivisation is not ok. It kills private innitiative, it keeps people poor, it keeps people in slavery, etc.
Stop thinking red. You are in TRP and you come with all this crap? Obesity is because people do not care what and how much they eat. Suicide rates in males is mostly because they are pussies and not being able to man up. Feminism, how it has affairs in collectivisation?
Yes, I oppose collectivisation so you can call me a bluepill beta male, I do not care. My wallet says other thing and the keys I have on my keyring also say other thing. Ask my lawyer also and he will say another thing regarding the rest of 40% of the missing property that will be gained back.
9. I will not comment on that, it just sounds so SJW retarded crap with social order. What do you even mean by that? Always explain yourself man when you are having a discussion with someone or an argument. Chill, I view this as a discussion and I would like to get more replies from you on this subject.
Regarding my point made for Godlike strict rules: no, I would not like such a system that tells me how to walk, what to wear, how to interract with people, what hairstyle shall I have.
The ""new man"" is bad because totalitarian regimes impose their view. In commie Romania, the commies envisioned that the new man (does not matter what sex you are) must be an engineer, architect, excellent at maths and exceptional scientists. There was no room for philosophers, artists, bankers, priests and other occupations related to those fields. Not good, a stable and functioning society needs everyone. From garbage collector, ticket seller, waitress, baker, banker, broker, aetist, philosofer, priest, stripper to engineers, mechanics, scientists, etc.
10. No, the roman republic =/= chinese republic. Do your homework please. USA, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, UK, Canada, Italy, etc are based on roman republics. China is just a dictatorship, a plain one.
11. No, there are no drones, spy camers, secret police, radar vans, etc in EU countries. In USA maybe, I do not know but in EU, nope. As I stated in this post previously, policits are totally different from USA and EU. Bernie is the only socialist in USA. The rest are conservators that are both in the left and right side which is impossible. Only Bernie can ve a lefty because socialism and communism in left. But again, I do not know much about USA politics. I view USA as being retarded. While the whole world uses metric system, they adopted their strange and confusing metrics in all aspects of life.
Wtf is a yard, gallon, mile, inch, fahrenheid (i am sure i spelled it incorrectly), lefties, righties in USA?
12 Well, if China was so rich like you said, why it did not made a huge national program for all people to have electric cars? Heavely reduce air pollution, ban kid labor, not affording more thay 1 kid in family, etc. Nope, even tho China is an economic giant, it's people are still poor.
Also, Germany's economy during A.H. was strong is fake. Nope, it was not an economic miracle. Hitler knew it and also he said it. That's one of many reasons he went to war, for hi's country not to economically fail in the next 5-10 years after '38. Please, just please, do not throw the ""but brah, da tankz"" because GE was not having that many tanks that others believed and also the tanks were crappy tanks. I would take a Sherman, Stuart, T34, SU, Firefly over any crappy Panther, Tiger, Toger 2, Elephant and also I would take a Spitfire and Hurricane over any german fighter until the jet ones.
13. Well, communism surely failed. It was present in so many countries during the Cold War and then it felt down.
South America, Africa and other capitalist failed countries do not represent an against capitalism point. It is important to see how they failed also.
I can say about Romania. It is a struggling capitalist country because 1. We did not know what capitalism is after 1989 so we are still learning what it is. 2. Our geopolitical position was against it. For cebturies we were invaded and razed by Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Russia, Austria. Can't really develop when your villages and small cities are razed, can you? 3. After 1989, people choosed neo commies and guess what neo commies did, they ruined the economy. Do you want details? I will give them if you want. In 2000, there was another chance. Between a nationalist, racist, commie hater, extremist and a commie hooligan, Romania choosed the commie. Vadim Tudor lost the elections because all ex commies allied against him and started a massive propaganda and spread fear (if he is elected, we all gonna die, executed, at gun point. He will lead us in chaos, dictatorship). The commies feared him because they knew that if Vadim would be elected, all ex commies would be shot, deported, jailed and monarchy would be reinstalled back in Romania under Michael the First.


Can you provide more sources claiming that US soldiers planted the virus in China besides UNZ?

As a resume: yes, commie is bad, no doubt in that and China created and exported Covid 19 by eating crazy stuff, more exctly in this situation: bats. I am not implying or advocating that China should be nuked, attacked with soldiers or anything but instead, China should apologise and take responsability for the situation and also stop being hyprocrites.

5998,5999,"I am not sure about the conspiracy thing, but for having directly experimented with its effects, I can tell you that yes, porn has devastating effects on sexuality and arousal. But you know what? Good for the rest of us. I am in my 40s, I have seen quite a bit, and I can tell you than women nowadays dont get enough attention. Back in the days, men would chase women and we were ready to do anything for you know what. Women would get annoyed by our horniness, and we would get accused of being only interested in sex. This is not happening anymore, and it is very distressing for women. It has considerably changed the balance of power. I have seen women in awe with my dick just because I could raise it, something which at any other time in history would have just been the normal. They would tell me of all their past dates that could not perform, and then they would just worship my dick and giving me anything I wanted just for being hard. Thats something I would not have seen 20 years ago. Sometimes, just being a bit bold and showing sexual interest is enough to get laid. It is a bit sad for women, as their needs do not get to be fulfilled, but it is also a fantastic time to live in if you dont watch porn and can maintain a normal sexuality!!",0

3251,3252,"So, just like rape culture, and the other things in this series, I'm going to make the same complaint. I think it's impossible to ""falsify"" hypergamy. I don't think it's something that exists universally in our world. I think there are clusters that have factors and pressures that make it worse than in other places (and vice versa, really) 

Certainly, I don't think every woman follows that sort of hypergamy path. Maybe most don't. I don't know. But I wouldn't say it's NEVER the case. Because that's obviously not true. And certainly, I've seen and heard about social pressures that actually serve to make hypergamy more expected behavior. 

I think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal. It's FAR from universal. 

Again, the best we can do is look at local factors. That's probably the best information  we can use on these topics.",0
4362,4363,"This is the key to making a relationship last and to getting girls wet over you.

Girls like emotion, they like uncertainty. Don't constantly shower her with attention. Sometimes when I'm texting my girlfriend, I say that I'm busy today and that I'll get back to her later. Sometimes I'll act a little cold and she'll immediately start wondering why. It keeps her curious and engaged.

One day you want her to feel happy, the next sad, the next a little angry, and the next day you want her horny.

Keeping a cycle of emotions going is the best thing you can do to have her go crazy for you.",1

4447,4448,"Women have zero interest in sex *compared to a man*.

Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general.

Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex.

If they did, society and culture would look completely different.  Even in ""modern"" super liberal attitude countries you see it.  Women just aren't into it.

Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date.  You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience.  Women wouldn't whine about ""cat calling"".  Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women.

If women pursued  sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on.

And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life.  So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't.  Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts.

Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors.  Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero.  if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that.  Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them.

Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do.

Women don't give a shit about sex.  Not really.  they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that?  Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole.

Whereas women don't think a hard cock is a hard cock, which is why they have 500000 requirements to fuck, whereas a man just requires a woman to be willing and available.",1

you'll say what I want to say but I can't stop myself commenting this that the
dashing and attractive look of shahid is shown in the movie which makes youth
think that they'll still manage to have that attractiveness ( Thick looking
beard, good hairs, those muscles and overall personality) in them even after
abusing drugs is so fake. And in reality if people start abusing drugs than
they'll become so unattractive bcoz reality will slap them so hardly and those
drugs would make you go bald, loose those muscles, loose ur charm, loose ur
social life, make you a failure in ur career and you won't even get that
respect as Kabir singh got in the movie)

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

&#x200B;

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

Men can walk away from their kids but if a women gives them up for adoption/abortion she a monster. 
Men can get away with changing their kids diapers once but god forbid a women hires a nanny or housekeeper. 
Single mother are shunned and laughed at but single fathers are heroes.

4648,4649,"Why I love my husband[Why I love my husband ](https://imgur.com/a/SYPeeAC)

He leads me in the Faith- he had a proven track record *before* I met him.

Before I met him; My husband he was active in ministry in his previous church. Once that church had dispensed he has committed to attending another church weekly. He has always given faithfully to the church and has supported various missions. He is also sponsoring a child.

After I met him; His commitments did not change. Since before we were engaged he brought me along to his church and introduced me to his church family. He has supported me in supporting the missions I am involved in financially and also agreed with my request for us to contribute more to the church. He has continued sponsoring a child (which he did not advertise to me, but I noticed when I saw a letter from world vision).

Now we are married; We attend church weekly together. Every night in bed he reads his bible next to me before we sleep. He also has a YouTube channel where he creates sermon jams. 

He has never over promised or broken a promise.

The first time I met my husband he kissed me on the cheek and opened the car door for me, the door swung back and closed, but by that time he was half way around the car. He cringed hard and tried to brush it off. 

From that first meeting forward he always opened my car door when coming to pick me up and closed it behind me. I would always giggle and insist he never had to do that and it was ridiculous to keep up, but on this occasion and on many he said Ill never do anything for you that I cant keep up. And it was true. 

He never over promised, he never over extended, he never spoilt me to woo me in the beginning then became tight later on. His spending, his actions towards me and his love for me never spiked then fell. He opened up the car door for me until we got married and started living together, so I open up my car door now (partly on my insistence, haha). After becoming ill and battling chronic illness, he started opening the door for me again when I was too weak. This is a small example of how he has stayed consistent.

He doesnt lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences.

I always used to joke with my husband why dont you just lie to me?! I dont want to know!  When he told me things I did not want to hear. I was joking, partly, as my sinfulness wanted an easy life and a man that told me what I wanted.

Well, through Gods grace to me, Im married to a man that is so honest to me, sometimes it is confrontational. He doesnt like above the knee jean shorts, he thinks theyre hideous. He doesnt like t-shirt dresses, he thinks theyre equally hideous (two things I wore often), he doesnt like long skirts on me, he doesnt like short hair etc...etc... it might sound picky, but its directional and in going against what hes said, that would be the true confrontation. It is unloving to do something you know your partner does not like.

My husband spoke to me and suggested we go shopping. He encouraged me to dress like some of the girls my age and that how they dress would suit me a lot (can you imagine hearing this without a humble heart?) but he has never brought something up without his support and means to fix the issue. So, he takes me shopping. Wow, look at my hot fianc! (We were engaged at the time) it made me feel admired and loved, it was amazing to see his reaction and how happy he was every time I skipped out to his car wearing the clothes he bought me. In saying that, we didnt buy anything I wasnt comfortable in, a few pairs of jeans, white sneakers, multiple t shirts of the same colour- so simple but he loved it, and I loved him even more for telling me. Ive bought many husband approved dresses since, which he adores.


He has clear standards for me. He introduced me to his friends, family and church. 

In his vetting process of me, he let me have his real personality from the beginning. He made things clear how he liked it and as we interacted with other couples, we saw real life examples of how we would and wouldnt want to be like. 

Couple A- My husband is friends with the husband. He cant stand the wife. Shes overweight, unkind and screams at her husband in public. My hubby was very clear at his distain for her and never pretended to like her even in front of her. He was blunt and didnt go out of his way to acknowledge her. It was clear he did not respect her. I never wanted that to be me.

Couple B- My husband did ministry for a long time with the husband of this couple. His wife was sweet, feminine and absolutely lovely. She was kind and warm to me when I was an outsider in the group. She was respectful of her husband and it showed in everything they did together. She was thin and dressed well. My husband enjoyed our time a lot with this couple and told me how much he respected their relationship. He would say things like theyre the real deal I think its amazing shes kept in shape so well after having a child 

By this feedback, and seeing how he treated these different types of people, and on top of that, knowing how consistent he is as a person, I knew how not to act. 

His health/ my health 

He has made it clear that cooking at home needs to be healthy. My husband goes to the gym 5-6 days a week and eats the same thing for lunch everyday. I would push him sometimes for him to let me prepare him lunch, but he insistent that is what he will eat everyday and it is what is best for his health. 

We go shopping together and buy the food I will cook together. I buy ingredients he likes and ingredients that are healthy. He has told me he wants veggies in his diet, so thats what I cook. He wants high protein meals, so thats what I cook. I make sure I have the ingredients for all the meals he could want (to a point) so he has the freedom to ask for what he wants for dinner.  

He has made what he wants clear. He does not allow us to eat take away more than once a week. He is hyper aware of his body (I always catch him tensing in front of the mirror, haha) and is hyper aware of my body. Hes made it clear he does not want me to gain any weight and that the weight I am right now is the largest he would like me (Im 58kg, 54) he has also found the most hilarious way to let me know Im gaining weight  wow honey, look how big your breasts are! Makes me laugh thinking about it. With his help, Ive stayed pretty much the same weight since meeting him. Him being honest about his absolute disgust for fat people has helped- and its a mutual thing. I wouldnt ever let him gain weight and I have his support back.


He takes care of me and brings me security 

Financial security; My husband sought to get a stable job and savings before he put himself on the market to be married. By the time I met him, he had a deposit saved for a house and a job that was recession proof. He made it clear to me that is getting a house together would require me working full time until we were ready for kids. He told me it would be difficult and that he would support me in this. 

God provided me a job that is close to home and my husband drives me every morning. (Currently not working due to COVID)

Health; during our engagement I had a trip to the ER. It turned out I had a cyst on my ovary, we did not realise the health hurdles we would be tackling in the next year and a half because of it. 5 more trips to the ER, specialist and doctors appointments, IUD insertions and a surgery later, Im still on the mend and take pain killers to manage in the meantime. This is a chronic condition called endometriosis. I never, ever expected my husband to be so supportive and unconditionally loyal. 

I remember on one trip to the hospital I was passing out in the passengers seat and vomiting. In my moments of consciousness I looked to my husband and he kept saying dont worry baby, we are almost there, its going to be ok.

I trusted him and let the anxiety go. Its a blurr but I ended up in a hospital bed getting emergency pain relief. He waited with me in the hospital the entire day. This happened quiet a few more times. After my operation I went back to the ER and we waited in the horrible waiting room chairs for 8 hours through the early hours of the morning. Everytime I looked at him I wanted to cry out of gratitude, I felt so horrid and he was right there with me. I can not believe the level of empathy and maturity he has shown to me when I was in 10/10 pain.

In my moments of absolute weakness and exhaustion, so much so I couldnt cry out to God, he would put his hand on me and pray for me.

He puts me first before his family.

We come from a traditional culture where the mothers tend to baby their sons. I love my MIL to death and I dont mind her asking questions, but my husband without hesitation always shuts everyone down if they question how I am at home. 

Does Anna cook for you everyday? He will respond along the lines of why does it matter? She can do as she likes shes the cook of the home. 

Oh, poor Anna, she cant speak our language he will respond what do you mean poor Anna? Shes a lion. You should be the one learning English.

He will shut down any conversation that is not kind to me, he does not complain about me to his family nor friends. He will not let his friends joke about our sex life.

He does not let me overextend myself for the sake of his family even though I am extremely willing to. He tells me and has the strong belief that our immediate family unit (him and me) are most important and everything else is secondary. We of course love his family a lot, especially his parents, but hes made it clear we wont partake in anything just for the sake of tradition. 

Bonus points:

-He gets along amazingly with my Dad, we all hang out all the time and its the best part of my life! 

-His family love me (they joke constantly they love me more than they love him!)
 
-He is good with children and loves his nephews, we even baby set sometimes.

-He grew his beard for me.",0

Which in this case could be the potential of not ""having"" her because there's no commitment. Which is a strange bit of cognitive dissonance as I have no goals of marriage. Having an exclusive partner/companion, yeah, but not any legal contractual bullshit.

This is very true. I left academia after my PhD, and that was in hard sciences. But I could see how people are holding onto research themes that make no sense, just because they get funding for it. If they were funded by private corporations, they would long have been gone.   


The word kafkaesque you used is spot on. What has been human's strength since the dawn of  ages is the collaboration between more pragmatic, ambitious, cold-blooded, rational man and the more intuitive, maternal, empathic, emotional and less rational woman. Each trait on each gender can be seen as positive or negative, but they each contribute to a certain balance.  


Starting to say that not just knowledge, but in fact the whole rational scientific method are 'oppressive', is one of the most self-destructive ideas that our society could have. Sure - we can't measure everything and see things black/white all the time (as men tend to), but we can't rule a society on hunches and beliefs either (as women tend to).",1
3688,3689,"Why is the ""Women only like jerks"" thing prevalent or at the very least not applied back?So I've been thinking about this for a bit.  Incels and some better men down on their luck, or guys who dont know better make the comment of ""Girls only like jerks"".  

Now I've thought about this and probably at one point agreed with it without thinking too much.  It's a thing in popular media and sometimes guys who seem like pricks have girlfriends and every wife beater has to have gotten a wife at some point (or else it's just assault).  Doesnt help that I watched a video by (Screamo?  Streamo?  Some variation of that I think it had an exclamation point, he interviewed the republican gun lobbyist who survived a school shooting) that literally had women calling him a jerk and a fuck boy but still saying they'd fuck him (I pulled one bit of salvageable advice out of that but that's another question)

But I've realized a few things (please poke holes if you can)

A) that implies monolithism (which not being that makes it really hard to discuss issues).  I've met some girls who would absolutely not tolerate dickishness

B)  Could be other features.  Most dicks are to some degree at least confident or driven so those are good qualities

C) most guys that say this aren't really guys I'd like to hang out with or classify as nice

But perhaps more importantly, 

D) guys do it too.


There is this thing that I think is just as prevalent in media about a dude defrosting an ice queen for lack of a better word (is that term sexist?  I think it is but languages fails me as I cannot think of a suitable replacement for the platonic ideal).


The women would undoubtedly be a jerk (why does that sound masculine?), or at the very least cold and unemotional.  Through out the movie (using a fictional example here) the hero would defrost her via kindness, witticism or heroism.  And they'd get together.  Now she doesn't necessarily have to be mean but definitely more business and aloof.  Or turning it

In real life I think its definitely a fantasy of most men for the same reasons above.  I know I personally have had crushes on girls who were not the kindest in their interactions with people (or at the very least attraction whether they were just genuinely attractive and my brain ignored the other parts or there ""badness"" made them more attractive).  



Point is that it's a phenomena and something I have personally experienced so I guess ""Guys like bad girls?"".  Not monolithic but it is to my knowledge a thing?


So why is it not generally levied in reverse?  Am I way off on my assumption and this is more a me thing?  Is it patriarchy?  Doe femcels not use this language?  Does if have to do with framing like the most attractive women is the evil one or they are made more attractive through framing?

You just want to maintain your frame as a calm, confident guy and escalate physically from being platonic.  More importantly, the time to act on things is when they feel right.  The time for a funny comment about her kissing you, is in response to when she brings it up.  The easiest time to escalate physically is if you're already dancing with her and physically close, etc.

From the little I know about your situation, it's tough to say where you stand.  But bottom line is that women like a witty, confident guy who doesnt seek their approval and presents as a challenge.  Live your best life, study/work, lift weights, meditate, avoid porn, etc.  Internalize the traits while improving your life with the above work ethic and you will be attractive to most women.

With THIS girl specifically, if she's attracted you already, then you have to escalate your relationship from platonic to physical.  If she is into you , but doesnt see you as a guy who has the balls to act on his desires... you will be permanently friendzoned.  Hopefully that's not where you are.  

Regardless, just live your life, have fun, tease her when you can, and don't try too hard.  Create sexual tension in situations where you can (look it up if you dont know what it means).  Break the touch barrier with non-threatening touch;  elbow, small of back, back of hand, etc.  Keep strong eye contact if you dont already, and a hint of a smile is also a good bet.  But most importantly, ACT when you have an opportunity;  to tease her, to escalate physically, etc.  Use the opportunities when she compliments you, to escalate and banter.  E.g. If she says she was into you the other day or compliments your dancing, you can say something like ""I dont blame you..  I actually had to turn it down a notch, I didn't want you to lose control"".  In other words, tease her when she compliments herself and agree with her in a cocky way when she compliments you.  Use your own words and style, they matter way less than your actions, body language and ultimately your balls to act.  Dont pass up good opportunities to act and escalate physically, sometimes they dont come again...",0

Intro

Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. 

Body

>Good seduction competently follows Mysterys attraction, comfort, escalation model and so lay reports tend to get repetitious. Im much more interested in the principles of game that you can use repeatedly to get ongoing results than any one particular story.

>Knowing the underlying principles means you can get repeat results. Recently I pulled together a threesome with my main girl and a new one I met, and taking RPDs excellent advice I wanted to write this lay report to crystallize for myself what I did right while my thoughts are fresh. I intend to do more of these in the future.

There are a number of takeaways

>Set the frame from the first time you meet a girl that youre a sexual, non-judgmental guy. Plant the seed with women you date as part of your sexual dirty talk that a threesome would be fun for you and her to enjoy together.

>When pitching the actual threesome date to a girl you dont know well, be indirect. Instead just suggest another friend joins for a drink or that you hang out at your place. Give girls plausible deniability.

>Threesomes take even stronger leading than a normal 1:1 date. You as the man have to lead the girls through the entire process.

Conclusion

Threesomes are fun but tricky. 

How this benefits the community

Most guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. If you are a guy and you want a threesome, then this is a guide to help you make that happen. Most guys have no idea how to make this happen so it's nice to see someone who does. 

TL;DR.

Threesomes are fun but tricky and this includes a bunch of information about how to make them happen.",1

6088,6089,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

i refuse to believe that all of these ""falsely accused"" ""india's sons"" are
actually purely innocent. additionally, when will we ever talk about the fact
that more often than not, these people get acquitted in the absence of any
physical evidence. get the ipc and study it carefully, falsely promising a
woman that you will marry her and then leaving her after having sex is rape;
forcing her to give consent/get her drunk to obtain consent is rape; even if
she consented (under any circumstances) but feels uncomfortable to go through
with it because of pain or any other factor, yet the boy keeps doing it, that
is rape. there's more than 10 circumstances that will be considered rape, in
the eyes of the law, but no, everything needs to be created at the male's

men now. let it be decided by the judge, what's false, what's not. who are we

3182,3183,"Self improvement resources for being a better/warmer conversationalist and for regulating emotionsI couldnt find this specifically through the search functions. Anyone here has book recommendations or practical applications on how to improve conversation skills in RPW context (I feel like conversing as a businesswoman is very different) and on how to regulate emotions?

Struggling with these two aspects a lot - its the last two things on my list to work on for my current self improvement journey. 

For conversation, I struggle with putting on a social mask, so to speak. Social niceties and sounding open/warm drain me a lot, because my character tends to be more calm, straightforward and logical, even serious. When Im not mentally prepared to make small talk, sometimes I get nervous and dont know how to reply, unless there is a point to the conversation (eg. we are meeting to discuss X, for example) or it is a genuinely interesting discussion without the social niceties filter.

I worry sometimes that I may be good for stimulating discussions, but may not be warm/affirmative enough. How can I present myself as warm in a conversation, without having to act bubbly? (I do feel warm and open to listening, Im just not sure that Im coming off that way!). I also have a very low threshold for bullshit, and many times conversations seem to involve white lies, feigned interest, bullshitting, which make it tiring. Is this a perspective problem that I have or is this something everyone just does out of practice?

This area in life has confused me so much. I would rather I have a more natural strategy too because I dont think I can keep up an act for the rest of my life. My MBTI is INTJ because it may explain some things.

My goal = be a better *female* friend to my female friends (not just a *masculine* friend), and a soft place to land for my future partner



Also struggling with regulating my emotions, I tend to change moods very quickly and dwell on the past/future a lot, and although there are no major mental health concerns, I would like to feel more stable/in tune and in control of my emotions. Stronger. I cant go to therapy at the moment because I pumped my money into fitness/feminine goals. Can anyone recommend some books?

Any other self improvement suggestions for soft skills also very much welcome. Hope everyone is safe and healthy in this climate!",0

3133,3134,"One thing you have to know is that there is a fundamental flaw in this question - ""What do women want?""

The flaw is this -- Every single man who ever asked this question is operating in a woman's frame, with her as the goddess whom he's trying to learn to please. And as we know, women don't have much of a frame at all. That is the source of the confusion. 

As for the much more useful question ""Who am I, the man?"", it never occurs to the average man to ask himself that, let alone answer it. His self awareness is limited to the knowledge that he's got a dick that has begun to work for more than just pissing, that his heart rate is a little higher and maybe his navel's tingling. I doubt if the thought even arose that yes, he is indeed a man... 

Which doesn't help him have a frame of a man in the least, let alone a life worthy of a man. 

It takes men a long way down the road to realize that even if they are doing everything else right, they are still not operating in their frame yet, but trying to find hers. That is more subtle stuff, not as easy to spot as skin and bones or a pot belly, or that you don't even know how to talk to a girl -- but it's the root of the problem. It takes even more experience to learn all the ways in which we're still subconsciously doing it. 

If you have properly gone through the trp factory, when you come out the other end, you should have an honest answer to ""Who am I as a man?"" and ""What kind of woman do I want? ""

And even then, growth and learning never end even for the best of us. We just learn to find out own way and make our own contribution from there.",0

You're looking at this wrong. If you're with an attractive girl, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. Get used to it or start dating uggos. Stop fearing the competition--be above it. If you're with a hot girl, you should ALREADY be above most of the competition. It shouldn't matter. Treat yourself like you're #1.

She systematically identifies and disproves myths such as the greater male variability hypothesis and the idea that women and men are psychologically different.

In the last weeks, you have probably stumbled upon some articles titled something like SELF-QUARANTINE : YOUR SURVIVAL GUIDE or HOW TO SURVIVE SELF-QUARANTINE and articles like these just elicit fear and anxiety among its readers. So Ive decided to take another approach, to change your perspective and encourage you to actually enjoy the remaining days of your self-quarantine.

First and to ease your mind, allow me to point out that once you look beyond the fear and anxiety, you will understand that there is an expiration date. You dont know when, but you know there is one. That alone will give you the strength to endure. This is the power of impermanence.

I know as youre going through it, it might not seem that way as theres a natural human inclination to think that whatever is going on is the way its always going to be. Obviously, thats not the case. This will be over again. It might be a few weeks, it might be a few months but it is going to end.

Allow me also to point out that you currently have one incredible asset in your possession that most people usually dont have in their lives which is time.  
Time is maybe the one asset in life you cant replace and we spend it usually running around going paycheck to paycheck hustling and bustling We have a period now where we dont have a choice but to have some time. Were stuck at home and that is actually an incredible opportunity.

I am going to list a lot of action steps that I consider very important so you can choose the ones youre interested in and focus on them.

The idea is to get you doing those things and do as much relaxation or entertainment as you want. That will be your reward! Whats important is that you enjoy your reward.

Lets get right to it...

&#x200B;

#### Be kind

Take 15 minutes from your day to call your grandparents or anyone you know who is especially at risk of complications from the virus.  
Check in on elderly neighbors you know (while keeping your distance). If they need supplies and feel unsafe going to the store, offer to go for them; or just give them a call to see how they are doing. And if you order something to your house, like pizza, generously tip the delivery guy.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Physically)

This is not a health pandemic. So please please please stay healthy!  
Dont get fat, keep eating well : get your fruits and vegetables. Take Vitamin D by getting some sunlight.  
This is a great moment to establish healthy routines by changing our diet and incorporating better nutrients into it.

Its also a great time to catch up on your sleep and let your body figure out your own personal circadian rhythm.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Mentally)

You can safely go outside while avoiding close contact with other people and touching surfaces that may be infected, and sometimes, this is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Soaking up sunshine and breathing fresh air will help rejuvenate you and make you feel better.  
You can also practice your walking past a stranger awkward smile you know the one

Weve all tried time and time again to get into a meditation routine, but there always seems to be something (like life, yknow!) that gets in the way. Well, now that many of us are staying home during the day we have the perfect chance to follow through on making this a new habit.

Another habit you can practice is self-care. It is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind healthy and happy. And self-care is imperative to stress management.  
And yes, for the guys reading this, its okay to practice some form of self-care. Its not exclusive to girls.

&#x200B;

#### Stay fit

No gym? No problem! We are creatures of habit and as such we get used to our daily routines and rituals. This is a great time to try and challenge yourself in other ways.  
Try a new fitness app. Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do squats in your room whatever you have to do. The important thing is that you keep moving, get your blood pumping and sweat as much as you can. This will benefit your mind and body equally.

&#x200B;

#### Read and study

One of the most amazing resources we have as human beings is the fact that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We dont have to relearn everything from scratch we dont have to figure everything out, almost everything you want to learn has been written down somewhere, its been put into a course by somebody or into a very good self-improvement blog (wink wink) so take advantage of this time to read a good book or study a subject that youve been wanting to study.

&#x200B;

#### Stay connected

Remember the phone? A long time ago it was used for a lot more than just texting and Instagram. Pick it up and call a parent, friend, or co worker. FaceTime with your friends. Improve your relationship with your family.  
Its important to keep working on your social skills, dont get rusty in that area and dont go into this depressive isolated place. This is actually in some ways an opportunity to bridge new social connections or to deepen the social connections you already have.

&#x200B;

#### Start your passion project

Not everyone is lucky enough to call their career or job their passion, but everyone has a passion. Maybe you want to start a home bakery or maybe you want to start your entrepreneurial adventure, theres really no better time than when youre sitting around doing nothing to get that in place and get that started.

You dont have to complete whatever project you start in the amount of time we are on lockdown, but you can definitely get the ball rolling and really create some momentum that would allow you to finish it soon.

&#x200B;

#### Learn a new skill

The business world is rapidly changing and new skills are needed constantly, but it can be nearly impossible to learn something new while youre just trying to keep your head above water at work. So take that online coding class, practice your video editing skills, or start learning a foreign language now. Imagine the surprise on your co-workers faces when you return from this hiatus speaking German!

There are lots of ways to teach yourself, with blogs, apps and online courses at your fingertips. If you learn a useful skill while away from the office, you will return to what may be a difficult job market with a leg up on your competition.",0

I came back recently to see if people are actually still hooking up through dating apps / how they are doing so, but I keep seeing posts on ""How to do a Facetime call?"" or ""How to talk to a girl over text?"" or ""Why aren't girls answering my texts?"" Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know how much of a waste of time that is? Do you know you're being used? Girls thrive on attention and you're giving them that, especially at a time like this. Seriously, stop it. I see some people claiming they've already made ""5-6 dates possible for after the quarantine."" Yeah, right cause the first person a girl wants to see after a quarantine is a random fucking stranger they ""met"" on a dating app, Jesus Christ. There's no guarantee you'll meet a girl after the quarantine is over and the quarantine isn't gonna be over anytime soon. You're being delusional and naive. There's no treatment for COVID-19 and there won't be a vaccine for another 12-18 months and yet we're acting like the situation right now is a temporary one, it's not. Get used to it. Either you're making actual moves and meeting people (obviously not in a crowded area), and accept youre taking a risk, or you're not. If you choose not to, then enjoy texting and Facetiming for the next few months-year and watch it take you nowhere. Wake up. Please.
