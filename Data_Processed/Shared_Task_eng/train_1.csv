False accusations and false witnesses who just wanted to get back at his family, ruined his life. 4 years of house arrest from 20 years old and on the sex offenders list.

###Physical

Goal: don't just *maintain muscle, gain muscle* over the next 60 days. 

Measurement: post cropped before and after pics as evidence.

Day 1 http://imgur.com/a/HT3NZYY

Week 1: 207lbs ~22%BF

Week 2: 201lbs ~20%BF

Week 3: 198lbs ~19%BF

Week 4/Day 30: 195lbs https://imgur.com/a/waZTVe6

Week 5: 192lbs ~ 17%BF

Week 6: 192lbs ~ 17%BF

Diet goal is to hit sub 12% BF during the Time Of No Lifts, sub 15% BF by end of #60DoD.

I'm eating healthy and 1000+ below my TDEE, OMAD except one or two days a week after morning workouts, protein is staying up at 1-1.5g/lb body weight per day, but my body seems to have decided that it wants to stick at 192lbs. I've lost 15lbs in the last 6 weeks but I've got another 12lbs to go to hit sub 12% BF and 7lbs to hit a true sub 15%. I'm about to go back into full Keto OMAD as I'm frustrated with the stall, I'm basically looking for some advice from guys who have done quick cuts like this 60 day one I'm doing now. Do I just soldier through with the low calorie count? My primary concern is to finish dropping this fucking fat and meet my BF% goal. If I lose a little muscle as well, fuck it, I can build it back better later from sub 12%. 

Thanks for the help bros

###Financial

I will find and buy a nice pair of shoes. 

###Professional

""I will update my resume with my new experience in preparation for promotion opportunities.""

I've put together a list of what I've accomplished of significance over the last 3 months to be refined into my resume. 7 things that those responsible for selecting the promotion would appreciate in a candidate.

###Social

I got halfway through writing out a mini FR for each date, and then realized the dates themselves don't matter. The girls don't matter. What does is what I learned about myself from them. 

I learned that me being ""me with MRP"" works just fine, most women eat that shit up, and those who don't seem to be unbalanced in some way, or else I showed too much weakness and they smelled it. 

I learned that I can more and more frequently think fast enough to frame myself positively while in the flow of conversation without lying, and if I can't I can change the subject, STFU, or AA AM PF. I'm learning that most of that I do automatically, its not a ""thinking it through"" kind of thing. You either do it or you don't. It's got to be natural, not forced. If it isn't, STFU.

I still talk way, way too much. 

I default to comfort/Beta behaviors so I have to constantly keep my focus on creating DHV/Alpha display opportunities and on that mindset, because the Beta comes through on its own. I also am successfully eliminating many low value Beta behaviors and sticking to more ""oakish"" and higher value ones. 

My attitude with these girls now is basically ""I'm interested in learning a bit about you to see if I think there's the possibility for more, but IDGAF if you reciprocate, and if you misbehave, bye because I've got better shit than this to be doing, this is for fun *for me*, and there's literally girls who wish they were out with me/talking/chatting tonight instead of you"" (this is not something that's spoken, its just my attitude. I'm not rude but I'm pretty clear about covertly signaling that they have stiff competition and about not caring if they like my personality or not)

###Mental

MRP fixes the man, and I've decided that I am a man worth the effort to fix. Even with how little work I've done so far, I have value. I am my prize no matter what anyone else thinks about how I'm living my life or the choices I make. Fuck who I let myself become with my ex, that guy was a butthurt dick who blamed everyone else for how his life was turning out. I'm better than that. The past is a lesson that doesn't define who I am or will become. 

*But* - that guy doesn't ever disappear. He's always there, waiting for me to get tired or lazy, so he can take over again. He mocks me with catcalls of ""its so nice to just relax and not be so *busy* all the time "" ""this soda is delicious, especially when paired with these French fries "" ""this videogame/movie is awesome! So glad I decided to spend hours of my life on this "" He is constantly testing my resolve. 

There is a ton of work to do. I have drive and high standards for myself, but like everyone else I avoid the hardest internal work and seem to be at my best when focused on one or two areas at a time. For the last 3 months that focus has been work and has now shifted to work and plating. 

I've been attempting to establish my career and my ""single life"" at the expense of my most critical internal work and my children. The first is not such a bad thing, a short term push for long term gains, the second I still feel has been necessary to figure out what I need to be focused on internally, I get constant data about my mental state from how I react to women. I've also needed the external motivation in my current frame-less faggot mode of being... That being said there hasn't been any wasted effort, just lessons, and groundwork laid for next steps in my journey. 

###Marriage

I've been making STBX calm down 3yo before bringing her to me for bed on my nights if 3yo isn't already with me as I wind down, because STBX lets 3yo stay up while she plays video games on STBX's nights, despite me telling her she needs to give 3yo a reasonable bed time. 

I'm not dealing with the fall out of her poor choices, she can fix it herself and give me a reasonably behaving child, not a tantrum throwing mess getting dumped in my lap at 9pm when I'm going to bed so she can go visit Chad.

###Family

Playing with 3yo more regularly, engaging her and being present. 14yo I am playing a long game, most times when I get home she is playing online with friends. I offer to do things she likes, so far only once has she taken me up on the offer, but I'lltake it, and we both had fun. I'll seek to build on that experience. I also drag her outside on weekends, even if just for lunch in the backyard with my parents and a bit of play with her sister on the swing set. She ""hates it"" but has fun once forced away from the screens inside the house with a moment to adjust her attitude.

###Goals

Don't let on that I know about STBX indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (16 week streak)

Plating OPSEC (4 week streak)

Go to at least one Social activity without family. (5 week streak)

Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (11 week streak)",0

4917,4918,"With such people making such remarks, it is always interesting to ask then why, if such words are so critically important that they denote sexism (which is so incredibly linguistically illiterate it's astounding), is their movement named after women, which clearly must also be a sign of sexism, and everything they fight against, from patriarchy to manspreading, manterupting and toxic masculinity, is named after men. Aren't such words also likely to be internalized harmfuly by young boys the way ""mankind"" is going to be internalized harmfuly by young girls?

Of course all of it is neglecting the fact that the ""man"" in mankind was the term representing a human being, and has to do with the hand (""main"" in French, same root as manual) at the time where male humans were referenced as ""wereman"" (like it is still in werewolf) and female humans were referenced as ""wyfman"".

It can be argued that the disparition of the ""were"" in front of man has more to do with the fact that men are only valued for what they do in society, hence their unique role being fused with the ""hand"", the ""man"" that is used to describe a profession (like in fireman, policeman).

To argue that the ""man"" in English word refer to men and is sexist is illiterate, and also (ironically since it is feminists we are talking about"" completely American-centric. It forgets that there ever was other languages than English, and that English has shared and borrowed words from all sorts of languages, including in large parts Latin and French. 

It is as incredibly stupid as ""we call it history because it is his story"", when in fact, it comes from historia in Latin (where ""his"" isn't a thing) and it is more likely that the word ""story"" actually comes from a deformation of ""history"" than the other way around.

6398,6399,"###Marriage

STBX is having car issues. Keeps dying in random places because she hasn't gotten proper maintenance done on it.

I need to reflect on why her negligence with her car maintenance makes me angry... it doesn't put the kids in danger really, just inconvenience and embarrass them and me (at least according to my feelings, and I don't want to make decisions based on that)

After reflection I've come to the conclusion that (as usual for me) it stems from my lack of control of the situation. I can't force or coerse STBX to live her life better, and yet she still has an impact on my children in very real and tangible ways. She is their female role model, and I don't like what she models a lot of the time. 

That said, I need to focus on my own shit before calling the kettle black. 

I made the appointment for the car and drove her to the bank to get her money. (Her car was fully nonfunctional at this point) Hopefully this puts an end to it IRL, but either way it was another opportunity for me to see inside myself and fix a fucked up thought/feeling.

###Family

STFU continues to be a critical part of my life, for a Different reason than most guys here. As previously covered, I rent the second floor of my parent's large home. Large enough that the space over the garage is now STBX's ""apartment"" with me just using the kitchen and laundry, and the space over the rest of the house is ""my apartment"" where I spend the majority of my time when I'm actually home. 

My parents obviously know that I'm out late several nights a week and for a chunk here and there on weekends, and while my step dad hasn't said anything, my mother has been probing and pressuring consistently. I've taken this as an important part of my growth program, because a large part of my BP conditioning and Nice Guy tendencies came from being raised by her in my early years as a single mother. Mostly I just STFU and ignore her, and I Fog outside of that. She's even gone overt once ""you're not working or running errands or working out this much, so why don't you take 3yo to play with your *friend's* kids? I'm sure they also have some???"" She's trying to Frame it as me missing time with my 3yo, but I'm doing this my way, and the stage of me being out until 9 almost every night will have been short lived. Like I said a few weeks ago, I always knew that my level of activity to create the plates I have now was not sustainable. Her feelings on this are not important. No one needs to know my inner thoughts, my plans, my weakness or my strength. No one. I am the judge of my own actions and I decide what I will do with my time. 

Had a ""critical moment"" with 3yo this week, from my perspective anyway. Critical more in my evaluation of my own efforts as a parent. Bedtime has been a sore point for me for a long time, and I haven't been consistent here like I have in many other areas of parenting for 3yo.

She had riled herself up to throwing a tantrum with mom, refusing to eat her dinner, despite STBX and my own attempts to de-escalate and distract her and get her to listen to us both. She was warned by both me and STBX many times that if she didn't stop, it would be early bed time with daddy. She kept going intentionally, gauging us both. So I took her to bed in my part of the house, spent about 15 minutes patiently but firmly leading her to calm down and stop the crying and screaming and such, then explaining what a consequence is and why she needs to listen to mom and dad, and staying firm through her varied techniques and attempts at getting me to cave and let her go back and finish eating her dinner in the noisy lit up part of the house. She finally fell asleep, and so did I, but even just a week or two ago I would have gotten frustrated that she always wants to be with mom where the screens are always on, and I would have taken her back to STBX and told her to deal with it. This time, while I am still unhappy with how STBX runs her end of bedtimes and continue to express this in the form of suggestions when 3yo is misbehaving, I didn't take my 3yo expressing this preference repeatedly as a personal offense and was amused by it instead - I had empathy for my 3yo and realized if I were in her shoes, I'd prefer mom too (little/no restrictions, stay up late every night, get away with a lot, tablet all the time to keep me out of mom's hair, etc) - but also I understand that as her father it is important for me to be consistent and follow through on things I tell her I am going to do, and teach her to live a life of integrity. I also want to model the type of man she should look for in her adult life, and a HVM doesn't let the mood swings of a toddler get the best of him

I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.

Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.

The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". 

Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. 

I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.

TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",1

3411,3412,"tl;dr: Exercise is by far one of the most irreplaceable methods of improvement and self-love, with one of the best guaranteed return for your investment. Whatever you may think you are, it's better to be that AND fit.

-----

Self-discipline is unique and has no substitute. There is no other way to do something than to just do it. Whenever you feel like not doing what you should, try this: acknowledge to yourself this emotion and then simply *do it anyway*.

The best time to start is twenty years ago, the second best time is yesterday. To address your specific examples:

> I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside

Pursue proper hygiene for your own benefit. It's much better to exist in a physical husk that is clean and smells nice. Also, you don't get another body and teeth aren't going to grow back. Even from a financial perspective you are saving money with good habits. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

> Im on Disability Welfare

It's a tool. Use it to attain the point of the tool: progressing past needing it.

> I have creeped out literally every girl that I have some sort of interest in due to getting obsessive and impatient.

Reflect on what you could've done differently. Try that. Reflect again. Repeat. The only real mistake is not learning from your mistakes.

> Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. 

Bro. Literally throwing money in the trash is better than spending it on egirls. There will always be more women for you out there, there will not be more yourself for you.

Spend the money on your own self-interests instead. Basic exercise equipment, healthy whole foods, clothes that fit, fundamental hygiene accessories, etc.

> I am 130kg

This is one of the most salient areas of improvement right now. You don't need to leave the house to start living healthier. Drink enough water, get enough sleep, eat enough protein + vitamins/minerals, and AT LEAST one hour of exercise a day. Day 1: sufficiently taxing cardiovasular activity (lay down and bicycle pedal if you have to) and Day 2: strength training. Repeat. Eat less calories than you burn to lose weight. You can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.

> I just do not want to be like this anymore. I dont want to keep creeping out everyone I walk past and be pitied like I was all my adulthood.

GOOD. Harness that.

> The worst part? I get panic attacks after hearing crowd noises and applause. This means no concerts, clubs or events. What the fuck am I meant to do here? Thankfully I wear noise-cancelling earphones with pink noise which can let me go to the city without panic.

Therapy and hard work. You can get past that.

> Finally, I wonder if this is even possible? Turning 26, never got remotely in a close relationship in my entire life and being an autist I really worry to see that I can get more mature than identically a 12yo

You could spend another quarter of a century being unproductive and STILL have more than enough time to turn your life around. You are still at the beginning of creating who you are, the finish line isn't even remotely close to being visible.

The most important thing is to structure this progress. Don't overwhelm yourself with impossible goals and then get dejected when they don't work out. All you need to do is NOT do nothing, even if it's just one thing per day.

414,415,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

3924,3925,"I think basic ideas like looking nice, maybe by working out a bit to attract more women and the psychological stuff to make women more attracted to you work, but I would advise against doing a lot of the psychological manipulation because it is well... manipulation. And it can get to a mentally abusive point with Red Pill ideology. 

But stuff that's not harmful like working out, looking nice, coming off confident, and tips to help make a connection with a woman or get her to notice you aren't too bad. Stuff like dreading a woman is pretty messed up though. So the basic tips that are perfectly healthy and just increase your chances aren't too bad but when it gets to manipulation which it will, steer clear of that stuff. 

The ideology, techniques and language Red Pillers believe in and use is designed to warp the perception of men new to the sub of how things really are and get you to doubt yourself and women, see flaws in yourself/dating/women even in normal interactions where there aren't any, and take self doubt and disenfranchisement with dating women and grow and use that to indoctrinate you with their beliefs and turn that into hatred of women. It gets pretty toxic ngl.

Just look at some of the ex Red Pill stories about Red Pill ruined a lot of guys relationships, not just romantic but nuked relationships between even years long friends and family, and at the time the guys thought they were doing better because they were drowning in
pussy, and every time they were sad because things in their life were fucked up, they leaned more into Red Pill instead of realising that it's normal to be sad when you've burnt down bridges with years long friends and your own family and lots of pussy is not going to solve that.",0

&#x200B;

Hello Everyone,

I have just watched this documentary which tends to show the reality of this hookup culture particularly focusing on graduates celeberating spring break on florida beaches. Some particular examples I would like to quote,

""It is easier to find FWB than boyfriends"" (girl 1)

""Guys believe they are entitled to our bodies; there is almost this one guy in every party who try to rip off my clothes"" (girl 2)

""I had always felt pressure from woman magazines to look sexy for boys and engage in frequent sex to get the validation I wanted"" (girl 3)

""I have always felt pressurerized to lose my virginity"" (Guy 1)

""Sex is not about love anymore, its about pleasure only. I don't have to know a girl to get into her pants. Let me demonstrate you (goes to demonstrate it)... You see, its so easy, the more intoxicated she is, the more likely she will drop her panties"" (Guy 2)

""I have come with my girlfriend here and I don't mind if she hooks up somewhere \[lol a cuck\]"" (Guy 3)

I live in a conservative muslim country where sexual market is controlled and free sex is frowned upon but thanks to feminism it is quickly changing. I used to believe that I had a disadvantage by not being born into a western liberal country but I don't think its true anymore. Its not because the girls are magically better but its because feminism has still not been able to destroy the fabric of this society. A regulated sexual market is both good for men and women, women retain their pair bonding ability and men don't have to worry about being compared to past sexual partners. Its a win-win situation for almost everyone (almost). Most people confuse TRP with another form of seduction and alpha male to be just a fucking machine. However, the reality is that in a society having the concept of masculinity solely revolving around the number of sexual partners could (almost) never produce homely virgin girls (with few exceptoins). The rise of feminsim has seen the rise of pornification of society, single motherhood, divorce rates, false rape accusations and other social ills. Women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas. They love to masculinize themsleves in order to get the dose of power which they could never taste even if they do they shall never be content because a woman's satisfaction lies in her being protected by a man. Being alpha is not about banging numerous women, this may have been an advantage during the dark ages but we are no longer in the dark ages and sticking to this dogma may damage male pysche as well e.g. depressing over not losing one's virginity due to peer pressure instead of working towards worthwhile goals. Is Dan Brazalian more alpha than an anverage guy who is working towards his goal and fortunately have a stable unicorn?. Hence, we should modify who really is  Alpha male:

1. Always working on self improvment.
2. Protecting his children and women (unicorn exists in controlled sexual markets).
3. Resisting Feminism and porn culture.
4. Achieving goals.
5. (Add what you think is constructive).

The degeneration of western society and downfall of fatherhood shall continue to move on if something is not done against this hedonistic feminsim. Although men have taken advantage from this hook up culture but the price which we are paying is far bigger than what can be put into words.  Banging multiple women cannot make our lives better, yes there is a burst of pleasure but its not good long term. I don't think a hook up culture and controlled sexual markets can co-exist ever.

Most men here use TRP knowledge to get into panites which does work because we know the nature of women but to find a traditional homely women is almost impossible.  I utilize TRP knowledge to pass shit test of women and her attraction only grows when you pass her shit tests. I was one of the victims of plantation culture until I came to TRP and received salvation.

Men can walk away from their kids but if a women gives them up for adoption/abortion she a monster. 
Men can get away with changing their kids diapers once but god forbid a women hires a nanny or housekeeper.

3564,3565,"Thoughts about gender-related insults?A friend of mine asked me yesterday if I thought an email she'd written sounded 'bitchy,' and it got me thinking about this. The friend is a feminist, if that makes a difference. Her choice of words took me aback a little because 'bitchy' isn't used often among the people with whom I hang out. I don't use it myself, but due to a general aversion to profanity or otherwise harsh language rather than any concerns about sexism. Upon reflection, though, I thought that 'bitchy' actually bothered me a bit rather than just surprising me. 

*Is* it sexist? 'Bitchy' only ever seems to be directed at either women or people perceived to be acting in a feminine or effeminate manner. Relatedly, the insult 'dick' (which I also don't use, but again not for sexism-related reasons) is pretty much never applied to women. However, something being statistically associated with only one gender doesn't mean it's necessarily sexist. 

It's not like I'd tell my friend she should stop using the term, but I am curious about feminists' views on gender-related insults such as this. Are they sexist? Or does nobody really care? It's quite possible I only took note of it due to great boredom rather than any actual hint of sexism.",0

2523,2524,"How To AMOG Beta MalesIt shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.

You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and
the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts,
situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal
level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very
existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but
at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so
important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or
dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the
opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we

5565,5566,"Is it just me or is it time to normalise non-invasive vasectomies the way we do IUDs? #ittakestwoBefore anyone gets defensive, lets break this down. Non-invasive vasectomies are...NON-INVASIVE. Theyre an outpatient procedure and after reading a lot about it, theyre compared to dental procedures that you can drive home from, and the worst part is the pain of anaesthetics. The only issue seems to be that vasectomies are harder (and completely possible) to reverse, and that insurance doesnt cover reversal (but they do cover vasectomies).

Now lets discuss IUDs. In a lot of countries, people who havent given birth aret considered for IUD procedures and some countries administer local anaesthesia. Im not mentioning it because I agree, but because of the implications of severity. Most women are given ibuprofen, which doesnt do much considering you have to push past the cervix opening (that is closed tight) with a rod to insert an IUD. For those who are having a hard time imagining, think about a hard rod being shoved up your urethra. 

As for side effects, where do I even begin? Constant bleeding for 1-6 months after the insertion? Weight gain? Acne? Fever and debilitating cramps after insertion? Severe PMS mood swings that border on clinical depression? Life threatening (ectopic) pregnancy? Irregular/heavy bleeding until its taken out? Increase risked of infections? Perforation (piercing through the uterus wall)? Extreme cramping with a copper (non-hormonal) IUD?

I am sick and tired, and frankly, disgusted, by the pressures put on women to be the ones responsible for birth control when it takes two to reproduce. And for the people who think: not my body, not my problem, you think paying for an abortion or child support is a risk not worth taking? Birth control comes with awful side effects, and do you know how stressful it is to take a pill at the same time everyday? Do you know what its like to make plans always having to consider that? Compared to a one-time non-invasive, outpatient procedure that has the highest rates of preventing pregnancy?

I see high school and college students taking responsibility and getting IUD insertions. Its about time we start calling out absurd double standards and placing responsibility on all participating parties.

Dear women, dont feel discouraged. Im iffy about talking to my male friends about this but what seems to separate the boys from the men is that while boys remain self-centred and self-involved, men understand my stance and even begin to agree with it.

I want to reiterate, Im not here to divide genders and pit them amongst themselves. Im here to spread awareness and to hold people accountable instead of babying them.

[Edit: I dont know if vasectomies are a viable solution. BUT...I would like to point out the discrepancy in the way we discuss what men might have to endure and what women have repeatedly endured. If theres such a huge burden on women, isnt it worth it to discuss and explore a variety of solutions no matter how bizarre they might seem before shutting it down completely? Are womens burdens THAT insignificant that we immediately shut down something that seems scary but may or may not be scary in actuality? THAT insignificant that we shut down solutions because the IDEA of it causes discomfort? THAT insignificant that possible pain takes priority of actual pain?]",0

There are lots of elements that it can't. No amount of perfect RPW behaviour can change a man who is fundamentally opposed to you in religion, or who does not enjoy sex with women, or who does not want children, or who doesn't consider women trustworthy, or who doesn't care about fidelity, or who thinks violence is an appropriate response to poor behaviour, or who has terrible attitudes towards money.

3280,3281,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

5397,5398,"High n count and long term relationships. Red Pill truths confirmed by a plate.TL;DR: A plate of mine confirmed red pill truths about how her having a very high N count resulted in not a single meaningful long term relationship that she so wanted to have.

We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story.

This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). 

Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). 

At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint. This seemed to calm her down a bit and I let her spin the hamster to a conclusion that all is good. After which we got down to business. 

Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here).",1

5718,5719,"great initiative. kudos. all sides need a voice to maintain balance of
judgement. but let's talk about most of the comments here that's like ' i take
this golden opportunity to give slippershot to feminists'. kindly tell me, are
feminists conspiring and encouraging women to file fake cases? how is this
even a logical inference.  
  
people hear about false cases and simply assume it's just women exacting
revenge or exhorting money. in reality, the reasons are so much more complex.  
  
majority of false cases (according to the delhi study) are filed by parents of
eloping daughters especially if the boy belongs to another community or
religion in order to end their relationship. and these cases were then deemed
false because of testimony of the girl involved.  
false cases with women doing out of revenge is really the least common type.
but people talking about false cases only zoom in on this type.  
  
truth is we don't really have much reliable post verdict data of all this.
there's only this one study that too conducted for delhi courts alone. we need
to press for more data and research of into this area (root causes) to amend
the rape laws in a way that's justifiable. one of the amendments i would
support is removing 'breach of promise of marriage'  
  
please understand increase in fake cases do not correspond to decrease in real
rape cases. according to nhfs and ncrb reports not even 1℅ of sexual assaults
even get reported. i have interracted with rape victims and inspite of all the
laws favoring women, victims still find it difficult to navigate the legal and
social system after a rape. they are very ofen shut up, threatened and shamed.
there's a systemic problem of underreporting of rape.  
  
often in an attempt to support false case victims, people end up undermining
the frequency and severity of rape in the process.  
  
it's a good thing, fake cases are coming to light and people are fighting for
justice where it's warranted. but a fight for more fair treatment of men need
not necessarily turn into a stupid fight against feminism.

413,414,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

But you know what? Good for the rest of us. I am in my 40s, I have seen quite a bit, and I can tell you than women nowadays dont get enough attention. Back in the days, men would chase women and we were ready to do anything for you know what. Women would get annoyed by our horniness, and we would get accused of being only interested in sex. This is not happening anymore, and it is very distressing for women. It has considerably changed the balance of power. I have seen women in awe with my dick just because I could raise it, something which at any other time in history would have just been the normal. They would tell me of all their past dates that could not perform, and then they would just worship my dick and giving me anything I wanted just for being hard. Thats something I would not have seen 20 years ago. Sometimes, just being a bit bold and showing sexual interest is enough to get laid. It is a bit sad for women, as their needs do not get to be fulfilled, but it is also a fantastic time to live in if you dont watch porn and can maintain a normal sexuality!!",0

I had horrible experience in dating with women before. All went sour because I was too needy.   
Thanks everyone on this sub.  


The push and pull technique really worked! And for me, it's the best method to get women.  
Women are more driven by emotion than logic. They get ""aroused"" when they get  curious about you.  
I gave her different signals. I am not predictable. I made sure she is always confused.  


I stopped obsessing about her. Before, I was checking her online status and social medias 24/7.  
I went out to play soccer/football, get a job, kept myself busy and play video games to stop being needy all the time. I realized I was talking and chatting her through the phone all day.

When I read about this sub, I immidietly stopped that hobby. 

She got attached to me because we were constantly chatting, so I decided to ""push"" her away by not replying her messages instantly. Declined her coffee and pizza invitations. Declined to play video games with her. I didn't make myself available all the time. Now she is thinking about me. 

Then I make my self available and chat to her always, then again go cold for a while - repeat. Making her really confused. ""Does he like me or not?""


This created more attraction.   
But it's really hard to control yourself. I just made myself busy to stop being needy.
 
Never confess your feelings to your crush. Why? Because she gets bored, she is no longer curious because she already got the answer.
When women fall in love to you, they become ""obssesed"". They no longer give a shit to your wealth and physical appearance.",1

He's not saying that every trait seen as masculine is toxic, but rather that the need to feel secure in a constructed male identity leads to devaluation of women, and that traits should be evaluated by the standard of what makes a good person rather than what makes a good man or woman.

Edit: I do describe myself as a masculine person, but that has nothing to do with seeing myself as male (I'm a cis woman). It's more a description of how people perceive me based on my appearance and mannerisms.

**TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.**

if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value.

men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that.

but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better.

I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women.

these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s.

so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked.

also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks.

arises when people get tired of the natural process. And this is basically
because of the arising pornography and vulgarity that is openly viewed and
displayed and majority are prone to it so when they grow tired of the nature,
they tend to find pleasure in something that goes against nature. So we need
to support good and decent content on media and promote early marriages to
abstain from this taboo. And ofcourse this homosexuality is a sign of the day
of judgement as we Muslims believe so we need to seek forgiveness and thank

3740,3741,"There are a lot of different ""types"" of people and what they say they want vs what they want.  I've noticed this with both sexes too.

I am a secure man (think Christian red pill) and I fully support my wife finishing her education and both her current, as well as future proposed career, among other things including helping her learn anything she wants, getting hobbies, and having self-care time (as Laura Doyle mentions is so critical).  I was not hesitant about any of the things you mention, but that is because I largely knew what I wanted and I was pursuing real love, not lust, or just friendship with benefits or something.

The biblical Proverbs 31 woman is so capable she works to sell things and even buys property.  But the key is - everything she does is part of her household team with her husband and under his authority.  It clearly talks about how her husband can hold an esteemed position because she is truly his helper, she supports him so he can function at a higher level.  Wow, I would love to have this type of support!
Can men abuse their authority? Definitely.  Can women be just as abusive like that or in other ways?  Definitely.  So again, it comes down to each person's individual heart - what they truly believe in and live out.  And I agree with the comments that it is an utter shame that most of us are not taught these key concepts, both men and women.  There are so many opportunities in our childhood and teen years to teach them.  My children will not grow up in ignorance and they and their future spouses will greatly benefit from that.",0

3867,3868,"Why do so many women tolerate and even encourage casual sexism from their friends/boyfriendsI am a woman myself. I was sexually harassed by a guy in my campus and the entire incident was caught on CCTV cameras, so when I reported he was suspended but got off without any punishment by using a legal loophole in the campus rules.

Knowing this and the existence of this proof even having seen it themselves in some cases, I still see the same women becoming his friends and hanging out with him as if it's totally normal. 
He never apologized he denied the whole incident and then went ahead to spread rumours about me being a ""characterless"" woman, who was drunk and delusional.

Not just this, the popular girls here the ones that are considered nice and you know not problematic or feminist like me, are usually the ones who allow casual sexism, laugh at sexist jokes, and basically appease men. I have tried hanging out in these groups or been forced on several occasions, and I've been put off by the huge amount of shit that these girls are putting up with. And when I bring it up they make excuses and they say it's how boys are.

I'm sick and tired, I've never been able to have female friends, just a couple of them. I'm tired of the normalisation of this behaviour. Why would any woman play against her own team, why would she support molesters? Why are they so scared of even trying to understand what feminism stands for?

3771,3772,"CMV: Social distancing will be apocalyptic for the dating lives of the 80%, and will cement hookup apps as the primary way sex happens and new relationships start.So first, two things that I'm sure everyone here on this sub agrees on:

1. OLD and hookup apps are heavily biased in favor of women and very physically attractive men. 

2. For men not in the top 20% genetically as far as looks go, meeting in person at a bar or party or other social venue is their best bet at pursuing women and giving themselves a chance to act attractively in a way that cannot be shown easily through an OLD profile. 

Well, now we are living in a time where it is unclear if bars or concert venues or even restaurants will ever return to the way they once were. Even when these establishments open back up its guaranteed that they will have to do so while observing social distancing protocols, limiting the number of patrons and perhaps even the kinds of interactions patrons can have. 

Basically, almost every single kind of public socializing venue is going to either close permanently or see up to 50% cuts in patronage and profitability, enforced either legally by public health officials, or emerging naturally because people will just be too spooked to go out in large crowds, probably for the foreseeable future. 

So what's going to happen to dating?

People will obviously still need to meet up and have sex, so workarounds will be found. Online dating already accounts for almost half of new relationships, and I think its pretty clear that this trend will accelerate in post pandemic Western society. I can easily see a future where people are posting negative COVID results on their profiles and going about meeting new sex partners privately, rather than risking going into public and exposing oneself to potentially thousands of unverified disease vectors. 

And, of course, for already naturally risk-averse women, anything less than Chad is now completely not worth the risk. 

So, take away billy beta's one way of appearing attractive to new women and up the risks of meeting anyone new such that only the Chadliest are worth the effort for women, and, well...

**Reading** TRM(v2) \[starting v3\]

**Physical**

Began the ninth (or tenth?) repeat of the 3-month-long Athlean-X program I bought a couple years ago. It has been money well-spent. Having an ""official program"" that spells out what to do every day is great for discipline, and reviewing the prep videos is always motivational. Also there is enough variety and intensity in it to keep it challenging - except I don't get the same variety with just home equipment. Next week we're told gyms open! I've also finished my first run thru the Core 4 Abs program and restarting it.

As part of getting my blood pressure under control the doc had me quit taking Naproxen. Consequently my joints ache all the time. Let's me know I'm still alive. New diet seems to be helping with weight, though, which is good.

**Work / Financial**

About a month ago just as the lockdown started I was transferred / matrixed to two women. I always ask ""what else do you need? What else should I be doing?"" etc. This week I find out one of them is complaining (not to me, of course) that I'm not doing what she wants. I contact her and ask her to tell me which team I should be working with, which of course she doesn't do. So now begins the recovery and ""alignment"" process. More importantly, trying to avoid being fired in this current work climate.

**Mindset**

This work situation is not unusual. There's always some executive somewhere looking for a reason to be upset. The tension is the ""edge"" for consultants. You never want to be too comfortable, you'll miss something. Also you need to continually be ready that any given Friday they can say ""don't come back Monday"". Its happened before and it will happen again. Sort of like the Stoic practice of thinking through the pre-fail or worst outcome as a way to mentally ground yourself.

3285,3286,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

I can't imagine 'thot' being used in any such way, because its always about that girl over there whose a whore. I find something deeply offensive in the idea that you're better than a woman, because she's had sex, or more likely, feels any sort of ownership in her own sexuality.

This tries directly into it being related to this fragile, bullshit macho attitude. There's a distinct component to toxic masculinity that is the idea that a man is inherently superior to a woman, and should have the pick of the litter for some idiot ideal of pure virgin waifu who's never so much as conceived of a dick and is outright terrified of masculine power.  Thot is an extension of this, a declaration of being above a woman who simply isn't some submissive, terrified maiden.

6096,6097,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

This makes me kinda out of my zone if you get me, I know it's as simple as ""let me kiss you"" (i tried and it works) but her ""coldness"" just sort of pushes me away and I end up sitting next to her wishing I was instead with a friend smoking a joint.

Certainly, I don't think every woman follows that sort of hypergamy path. Maybe most don't. I don't know. But I wouldn't say it's NEVER the case. Because that's obviously not true. And certainly, I've seen and heard about social pressures that actually serve to make hypergamy more expected behavior. 

I think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal. It's FAR from universal.

Country still has no lockdown.

Stats: age mid 30, married to wife (mid 30), 3 kids (2, 5, 7). Height 5'9"". Weight: 76 kg (167 lbs). Strong lift 5x5, B 55 kg,+5 OHP 45 kg, DL 70 kg, SQ 90 kg, ROW 50 kg.

Still reading some of the sidebar, The Book of Pook, The seduction method. WISNIFG.

**Physical/training**

Finally got the form issue sorted with BP, hope to see more chest growth coming weeks. Compiled pictures of muscle development and see continuous progress since mid feb when I started. 

Got private boxing training from a friend which was great. Hoping to do this every week.

**Marriage/How not to do MRP**

Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good.

After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down  (crying and  asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed.

Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my  worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good.

Failings:

\- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit

\- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol)

\-  Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that)

\- No real OI when facing denial/indifference.

Success (I think)

\- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats.

\- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly)

\- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval)

\- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account"").

**Mental**

Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes.

**Sex**

After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz.   

**Family**

Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great.

**Social**

Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends.

**Week goals**

\- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success)

\- No losing calm at all (2 week success)

\- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend)

**Shit owning / Goals**

\- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue)

\- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week)

\- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot.

~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here.

~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though.

\- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame.

~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.)

\- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there)

**Mission**

*Not only star in the exciting film of life but direct it as well and make people want to co-cast.*

\- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle.

\- Be financially independent before 60",1

6092,6093,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

I can't imagine 'thot' being used in any such way, because its always about that girl over there whose a whore. I find something deeply offensive in the idea that you're better than a woman, because she's had sex, or more likely, feels any sort of ownership in her own sexuality.

This tries directly into it being related to this fragile, bullshit macho attitude. There's a distinct component to toxic masculinity that is the idea that a man is inherently superior to a woman, and should have the pick of the litter for some idiot ideal of pure virgin waifu who's never so much as conceived of a dick and is outright terrified of masculine power.

As per a report in the Hindustan Times, he was accused by a girl of molestation on social media, the police said. He was named in a MeToo post on social networking site Instagram. The post from the girl came on the day when the Bois Locker Room group controversy came to light, which has triggered nationwide outrage.

HT mentions an officer saying: No suicide note was found but messages retrieved from the boys phone showed that fellow students warned him that he will be questioned by the police.

Reports say that the police are investigating the deceased boy's alleged involvement in Bois Locker Room Instagram account. His phone has been seized and sent for analysis. The cyber crime cell has been looped in. His social media account and chats will be investigated to help understand why he took the extreme step.

The report says, ""The police official ruled out any foul play during preliminary investigation. The deceased has not left any suicide note. Further action will be taken only after detailed reports of his mobile analysis is received. As of now, legal proceedings under CrPC 174 have been initiated.""

As NCR fights against the Covid-19 situation, the incident involving a group of social media users on Instagram came to light. The incident, now known as Bois Locker Room incident, made news after a girl from South Delhi shared a screenshot on social media. The screenshot went viral.

The screenshot brought to light the activities on this particular group, where the users, as it appeared on the screenshot, showed school boys sharing photos of underage girls. The chats have shown the boys to have objectified the girls and to have planned 'gang rapes'.

Almost all the 21 members of the group have been identified. They will be examined.

Owing to the lockdown, the 15-year-old apprehended has not yet been produced before the juvenile justice (JJ) board, this report says.

The boy is said to have told counsellors and police that he was added by a classmate to the group during the last week of March.

After some days, they added a total of 51 people to their group and also made another group. Some of them allegedly started sharing photos posted by girls on their Instagram accounts. Some allegedly shared morphed photos as well, the Indian Express report quotes an officer saying.

5675,5676,"My teachers were generally pretty kind to me -- because I was a star pupil with a genuine love for learning and a creative, out-of-the-box perspective on just about every topic. HOWEVER, when I was bullied in class, they would do nothing to stop the bullies from picking on me. When I complained, they told me that without proof there was nothing they could do.

One day, in 7th grade, I brought a tiny recording device (this was in the late '90s, when dinosaurs walked the Earth and smart phones were not yet a given), and used it to record my bullies' merciless insults during our group lab. I planned on using the recording as proof of my suffering so maybe the teacher could intervene. Unfortunately I became upset and let the head bully know I was recording him. He immediately told the teacher I was recording him and the teacher, with an apology, confiscated my device.

There was another time in 6th grade where my bully was punished, but I was punished for my reaction to the bully. The bully in question publicly and loudly accused me of m""\*%$\*@$ing in the bathroom during an indoor recess held in the gym, and I left school right then and there, riding my bike home in the snow to escape the humiliation. My bully received 3 after-school detentions for her action, and I received a single day of in-school suspension (I got to do all my schoolwork and homework privately in school, and then read all day, not that much of a punishment).

There was also the time some idiot etched a b@mb threat across the bathroom walls in 9th grade, and a few bully types decided to accuse me. I was, of course, called into the school psychologist's office and questioned. And of course when I tried to explain my suicidal thoughts resulting from years of bullying to that same school psychologist, I was sent to a hospital for a suicide risk assessment. Same after the 11th-grade ""Project Love"" anti-bullying seminar, in which I publicly announced the division between school-aged ""Predators"" and ""Prey Animals"" and theorised that merciless bullying by the stronger ""Predators"" was a subconscious attempt to convince the less popular among the population to off ourselves, culling the herd until only the more desirable folks remained.

My uni profs also rather loved me, with one or two exceptions where I just wasn;t invested int he class...but then again, most of my uni profs were not supermodels.

It almost seems that altogether, my teachers were on the kinder end of the spectrum. Was I just lucky, or was this a side effect of attending school in the long-ago '90s and '00s?",0

1798,1799,"Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not
follow western culture(even banned in Christianity).  
Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can
only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big
misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's
genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be
genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a
gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of
nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind
later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries
earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who
fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had
multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started
getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor
he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven
that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout
your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us
a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments.
So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it
in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their
opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a
mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy
psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just
to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the
rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue
our sexual and spiritual life.  
At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the
Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be
legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature
given laws and the Truth of life.

Men who are extremely needy assume that, to be not needy, you should be the polar opposite - completely disinterested. In truth, it's about striking a balance by having clear boundaries you don't cross. Highly recommend you read the book if you struggle with needy behavior. 

To apply this to your example. The girl who wants you to be in touch constantly is playing on your neediness. You obey her because you desperately want your needs met, but it's actually hurting you. You appear low value because you're too available. 

Nothing else more important is taking up your time? No job? No gym? No hobby? No friends? That subcommunicates that she's more important than anything else going on in your life. Not what she's looking for. 

A boundary you can set is that you won't placate women who demand your attention. She can learn to deal with you being unavailable or she can find someone else to annoy.

You'll find that actually this boundary might upset her initially. But, if she's a good person, she'll respect you for having the self-respect and self-confidence and self-assurance to set and enforce a personal boundary. Men who capitulate demonstrate a weak character.",0

While I do agree more money should be invested on reducing how invasive the process is (and how difficult the procedure is to undergo and recover from) for people with ovaries, because they are internal organs and testes are external, there's only so much that can be done in that respect as well. I think because of those hard limitations on the potential advancements for oocyte collection, research has focused on making the eggs collected more viable for longer-- specifically because they are harder to get in the first place.

Whenever I see couples in public I assume the woman isn't actually attracted to the man unless hes conventionally attractive. In my mind, women have a dual mating strategy.

###Physical

Goal: don't just *maintain muscle, gain muscle* over the next 60 days. 

Measurement: post cropped before and after pics as evidence.

Day 1 http://imgur.com/a/HT3NZYY

Week 1: 207lbs ~22%BF

Week 2: 201lbs ~20%BF

Week 3: 198lbs ~19%BF

Week 4/Day 30: 195lbs https://imgur.com/a/waZTVe6

Diet goal is to hit sub 15% BF during the Time Of No Lifts

Hygiene: I had already been brushing my teeth, washing my face, feet, and ass before finding MRP. I have now cleaned my living space and am going to keep it organized and orderly, I let things pile up over the last few weeks while I've been prioritizing work and fucking around with girls 

###Mental

If I don't put me and my responsibilities first I will end up right back where I started, possibly in a worse place. It needs to be where I'm not chasing pussy, pussy is chasing me, and I give it the time of day on my terms and on my time, when my shit has actually been owned, and I have time to spare that I want to spend enjoying the company of a woman worth my time.

The external validation is like meth, extremely addictive, and it had been so long since I've felt a woman's interest, it was like being a first time user. In some ways I really am. On some level I knew all this, yet was weak over the last 2 weeks and indulged anyway. I'm coming down off of the validation binge now, and settling into what I said I needed to do last OYS: a more manageable amount of time spent on plating. I'll continue to step down my time commitment over the coming weeks, and continue working on identifying when I'm interacting for their validation (don't do it) and when I'm interacting for my own enjoyment and giving my time freely without expecting something back. 

###Family

Still not spending as much time as I was here before plating, makes sense, you can only do one thing with your time at any given moment, I can't read 48LOP as a bedtime story to my 3yo, nor can I be at home with my kids if I'm out on a date, or at work, etc. 

###Financial

Saving a lot. Stimulus came in, saving that too. 

Bought some new clothes in prep for Style week of 60DoD, this should finish out the cycling of my wardrobe that I've done over the last 6 months, it will be piecemeal from now on, cleaning out old/stained things and replacing those with new ones. 

###Professional

My temporary assignment is nearly over, and the permanent promotions needed to free up that position for me haven't happened yet. They did extend me in this position though, another month. No matter what I'm in so much of a better position to take the next similar opening that its not even funny. I killed it over the last 3 months and everyone, I mean everyone, knows it. 

###Social

Been having fun on my dates. 

Fucked Property Manager again, this time without the Nice Guy backdrop - I just did what I wanted, came, and that was that. Didn't worry about her at all. Spent a total of an hour at her place? Doesn't really matter. I wanted to fuck, so I did. 

Date 2 with Nurse is tomorrow. She said maybe at first, so I asked the next day ""is it a yes for you, or should I put that time back out on the market?"" Her ""Woooow, you are cut throat"" I said, my free time is valuable to me, we can hang out next week if it isn't good for you, just don't leave me in limbo. She said ""Got it"" and agreed to the date. We are doing a private Happy Hour at a secluded spot I picked out. 

Date 2 with Diver is a maybe, this one is a good learning opportunity for me, she's super assertive and independent, and I'm sometimes not sure how to respond because of it. She talked so much that I don't have to say much. We agreed to a plan, and when I texted to confirm the day before, she reneged but offered to reschedule to the next day. So I told her to come up with the idea, and once she had decided and suggested it I put a plan together to make it worth my time and fun for me and gave her a part in it. That plan she followed my lead and completed her assigned part quite well. Internally I focused on not reacting to her having so casually altered agreed on plans and staying positive and fun instead of getting offended like a faggot that she didn't do what I wanted when I wanted.

Date 2 with Physical Therapist is a maybe. She's smart but kind of full of herself, maybe takes herself a little too seriously. 

Date 1 with Server who shit tested is later this week. 

Out of the 4 I like Nurse and Phys the best, they are the most fun to be with, but I'm keeping the pipeline moving. Lining up 4 more girls, but not taking so much time with any of them as I did the first batch. I'm learning.

###Marriage

STBX was pissed back in February because I sent our tax refund to my personal account, then transferred her half when it came in. ""It should have gone to our joint account"" - and now with the stimulus it automatically went to my account again  so she was upset again. So I told her ""You threatened to take money that doesn't belong to you when you overreacted to me putting the savings back in savings at the end of last year. I've shared everything we've received 50/50. Maybe don't make threats next time, and I won't feel the need to protect myself."" She tried to twist the facts, but I stood my ground, so she texted my mom a screengrab of our conversation . My mom told me she had and said I should be nicer... I told her to mind her own business. 

Nothing else significant... finally found a place still doing Notary work and made an appointment this next week to get the uncontested document Notarized, STBX will be there to sign. 

###Goals

Don't let on that I know about her indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (14 week streak)

Plating OPSEC (2 week streak)

Go to at least one Social activity without family. (3 week streak)

Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (9 week streak)",0

**TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.**

if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value.

men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that.

but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better.

I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women.

these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s.

so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked.

also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks.

so don't give a damn about other subs like gonewild, butterface, etc. while facial bone structure is really really important there are many cute-the-girl-next-door girls who would be seen ugly online while in real life they would be wanted.",1

3806,3807,"Own Your Shit Weekly - April 21, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

3872,3873,"I describe it as the maternal-like trope of girls and women thinking theyre protecting men from the big bad feminists or other women. 

Its usually common to see around women who are outrageously anti-feminist. Theyre the women who claim that their boyfriend couldnt have raped someone and obviously shes lying for attention, the mothers who believe their sons need to be kept away from gold diggers, the sisters who believe her brother was trapped by someone looking to get pregnant, etc. 

I just named it such because its a mentality thats very surrounded by oh poor baby, let me protect/take care of you. Youre right, that thing about rape was just a joke, theyre just trying to make you feel bad. Youre a great guy! These feminists have taken it too far! I wont let them hurt you.",0

I'm tired of 'nazi bad, communist good' bull shit narratives, when communists killed far more people than nazis ever could or did even during the same time line and for worse reasons. How about a storyline where it shows how some one became a nazi or some shit, cause it's not out of fucking ignorant hate like people like. Something drives people to evil or wrong deeds where they see it as no other solution for an issue they have. Go over how WWI was a mixed bag of blame and who started it really is confusing to this day, but germany was given the shitload of blame for losing and despite multiple leaders saying it's a bad idea to blame them and punish them for WWI cause there'd just be another one after, left them a toothless, trodden, stepped on pile of turds by the rest of the world that they don't even blame them for. Imagine living in a country like this and seeing it constantly mock you. There's a snapping point where people don't care anymore after being picked on or stepped on for so long and so hard they'll turn to dark actions.

Show why the south has a weirdly french cultural influence and all the reasons why the civil war happened. Slavery and why the south didn't want that to end just there. One of the main thing is that the south had a lot of french refugees from Haiti 60 years prior to the civil war when the Haitian genocide happened, when there was a slave rebellion that killed the french settler army. Then soon after a second genocide where all french women and children included were targets, they went house to house with this.

Go over the basic concept of hate doesn't come from ignorance, it is a reaction to knowledge of things. It is not inherent, it is learned. Don't put some sort of dehumanizing lens of cartoonish evil nonsense on it constantly and understand why people turn to these horrid things. Basic fucking empathy to understand how to avoid it repeating. Every evil deed in history has been justified by the time it happened and the stakes it presented. Every evil deed reviewed by history is demonized or idolized by who ever controls the lesson plan for that day.

Oh, and stop two things in every fucking game in the past: Every 'minority' group getting along fine, and the weirdo progressive main protagonist that thinks the other group of criminals is worse than them cause they're racist/sexist what ever. Every civil rights group has historically HATED each other. Black-civil rights groups hated LGBT as did the feminists, feminists called black-civil rights groups N-word constantly and complained that they let (word) vote before them. Hell, it's LGBT today not because it was chosen like that, it was originally GLBT for how many there typically is going down with the letters, but to stop feminists from hating gay guys they changed it to LGBT. Hell, feminism's proudest thing in american, Planned Parenthood, started by a super racist eugenicists who wanted to open a bunch of them to abort black kids mostly, and looking at their typical locations, they're doing great in that regard for her plan.

The other weirdly progressive for his time protagonist thing. The worse thing you can do is kill some one. Because one dude is more selective/trigger happy when their target is a different shade doesn't magically make them better than the trigger happy ass hole who just kills cause reason. Being selective in who you murder doesn't make anyone worse for being a normal murderer.",0

How does one make a man feel like a hero or that he is needed if, well, you dont really need him (in the traditional sense)? I am not masculine or alpha or aggressive at all, but I have had relationships break down because I didnt make my partners feel needed. Both of my two big breakups were with men in respectable, but not high-powered, careers whod been excited about me because I had a real job. Both breakups happened because they said they felt like I did not need them, and I am trying to figure out if it was due to something that I did wrong or if egos had played a role. If I need to play down aspects of myself or if Id just been with very insecure people. 


I do not brag about my schooling or my job or anything like that EVER. It is a lesson that has been voiced to me by many of my female mentors and I am well aware that men do not care much about womens accomplishments, Ivy League pedigree, or professional prowess. If anything, I downplay my career (currently a resident) and background. But the fact of the matter is that I have always worked hard, gone to top schools, and stayed on track. I am not a hardened, un-feminine career woman but I am simply driven by what I do (specialty derm) and am good at it. And I feel like I am being penalized for having high income potential on top of it all. After my most recent ex found out that I would be averaging $500k in a few years, he started picking fights and always making me out to be the villain, and I know Im not imagining it. It ultimately ended with the explanation of you dont need me, youll find someone better and leave. Maybe he was letting me down easy but I myself know that I am attractive. My work ethic translates to my physical upkeep, and I have improved my looks since we began dating, if anything.


I know that a lot of it has to do with him not feeling like a hero, but I really did try to make sure he felt needed. Its just that I dont really need any saving. I want a partner, and it seems like that is too much to ask. Has anyone else been in this situation?",0

women misusing laws against men in india for extortion, manipulation and
revenge/vendetta has become an epidemic that not only threatens the moral
fabric of our society but puts lacs of innocent men behind bars.  
  
lacs of innocent men are languishing behind bars in overcrowded jails, and
there are no laws to protect them or legal body to hear their anguish and
support them.  
  
our constitution states that we are all equal irrespective of caste, colour or
gender. however, we have laws that only protect women and no parallel laws to
protect men. in fact, pro-women laws are being misused to victimise men and
men have no real recourse under law.  
  
we need to put deterrents in place to prevent misuse of laws, victimisation of
men, and also to ensure gender neutral laws are put in place.

sister, wife, daughter all bear the brunt of his rapist hashtag. shockingly if
case is proven false, no real punishment is meted out the woman who has
destroyed the life, career, reputation of the man and put him and his family
through mental, emotional and physical torture. punishment for the woman can
be a mere 500 rupees.statistics are shocking.  
  
data by the delhi commission for women states 53.2% of rape cases filed in
delhi between april 2013 and july 2014 turned out to be false.  
  
2\. rape/ domestic violence cases filed post 3 months of date of alleged
rape/abuse to be treated differently and arrest only after investigation of
the same.  
  
most fake cases are filed after deliberation, plotting and connivance with
friends, family and lawyers.  
  
statistics claim almost 75 % of dv cases are false and according to ncrb data,
10% dowry cases filed each year are proven false. there are over 11 lac men
languishing in jails implicated in false cases.  
  
in 2013, out of the investigated 1,12,058 cases, 10,864 were false. and in
2012, 10,235 out of 1,03,848 were proven false. after this data was released,
the supreme court had observed that the law meant to combat the menace of
harassment of women by their husband or in-laws was often being used as a
“weapon rather than shield by disgruntled wives”. the ipc 498a being a
cognisable and non-bailable offence only worsens the plight of those falsely
accused. sections 354, 509 and 376 are there to protect women, and not to
terrorise innocent men.  
  
3\. severe penalty to put in place for women who have been proven to have
filed a fake case as deterrent to others.  
  
please note: there is a distinction between an acqquital on grounds of
insufficient evidence and when it is a proven false case.  
  
4\. creation of national commission for men.  
  
if women have a body that addresses their issues we need one in place for men
as well. data states that for for every 16 women who commit suicide 25 men
commit suicide.  
  
5\. introduce purushdhan which will give a man the same economic rights and
footing as streedhan.  
  
many cases are coming to light of women marrying men and within a few months
demanding divorce and large sums of money. they threaten a man and his family
under sections of 376, 354, 509 and 498a if they don't comply. the assets a
man is given by his famliy or what he has earned prior to marriage should be
considered his. only what is earned during their marriage should be part of a
divorce proceeding based on number of years spent together and whether kids
are involved.  
  
6\. right to prenuptial agreements  
  
currently pre nups are not legal as it absurdly gets challenged under bonded
labour laws. men are increasingly shying away from marriage as it means
extortion. clarity on money will bring rights and respect to both.  
  
7\. to clearly define rape  
  
there have been judgements stating that if a man is in a live in relationship
it can fall under rape. promise to marry and not marrying is equivalent to
rape. rape is a heinous crime and laws for it are stringent. we need to
clearly define rape.  
  
8\. palimony to be taken as seriously as alimony.  
  
if a man is not earning and a woman is, he should be entitled to palimony with
the same respect and laws that grant a woman alimony.  
  
9\. gender neutral laws to be implemented  
  
when men face domestic violence there is no law to support them even if they
submit videographic evidence. same with rape. men on men rape and women on men
rape needs to recognised especically when rape is defined as intercourse under
threat/coercion. also for sexual harassment laws in the workplace to be gender
neutral.  
  
men in india have been imprisoned not only by gender stereotyping but also a
lack of laws and no official body to hear their cries. men are human. and if
we want an equal society, equal relationships, equal justice, we need equal
laws.

The way I've understood it thus far, it is ""fair use"" to use a piece of copyrighted material if you are providing critique, commentary, education, satire, etc *on that material.* Providing commentary on copyright law in general is not commentary on that piece of music.

Of course, there is no market usurpation, and I'm sure a minimal clip was used, though that might not be enough of a defense. The nature of the work is clearly a for-profit music arrangement in an artful and novel expression.

In effect, nobody is claiming this *isn't* copyright infringement, but is it really *fair use?*  
It'll be fascinating to see where this goes and what effects, if any, it will have on automated copyright strikes, because automatic systems probably can't do the research required to make a good faith judgement as required by the DMCA.

6051,6052,"See, the problem is you're comparing Western media to Eastern.

In Western media, a character isn't just a character. No, they *represent* an entire class of people! At least, that's how it is to the loudest voices (i.e. ""journalists"" and Twitter-addicted losers). You can't have a Galbrush in Western media, because if she's abused or is a failure, it somehow represents *all women* or how the author *views* all women, and is thus sexist.

In Eastern media, a character IS just a character, and not a vehicle for representation. At least, the media/fans don't treat it as such (unless it's reviewed by Western media idiots, like ANN). So, you *can* have a Galbrush in Eastern media, because she is allowed to be flawed or is allowed to fail or be abused.

You rarely see any ""controversy"" about anime/manga/LNs until they come over here... For example, I believe ANN had interviewed the director or producer of the Goblin Slayer anime (I think?) and asked them about how they handled the controversy over in Japan, and their response was basically ""what controversy?""   
That is to say, it's not like they *don't* get whiners from the East. Like with the recent ""controversy"" over a My Hero Academia villain... it was *Chinese* fans getting angry, claiming the character's name was a WW2 reference... So Horikoshi changes the character's name... and then they're *angry about the new name*, too.",0

4318,4319,"TRP was meant for Average Frustrated Chumps not Bottom Tier Omegas**Who is the Average Frustrated Chump?**

The average frustrated chump aka our beloved beta has had a semi normal childhood. They know how to talk to people and make friends. They have a friend group that goes outs and meets girls. The average frustrated chumps has gotten girlfriends in the past and knows how to flirt(albeit badly). 

Our AFC is a 5.

The purpose of TRP was to teach 5's how to improve their looks to a 7.5 and how to act like a player.       
 It also teaches men to take women off the pedestal. 

Go to the gym, fix your wardrobe , get an awesome haircut.

 Stop trying to be friends first.  Assume attraction. Kill approach anxiety. 

2-3 years of consistent effort and you can go from a 5 to 7. It works for guys with a decent starting point.

Another important note is that a 5 will see results faster. A wardrobe and hair cut can bring a 5 to 6. His friends will compliment his newbie gains. This postive feedback will motivate him to continue his journey.

**However TRP was never meant for Bottom Tier Omegas**

Omegas are guys who have no social life , no experience with women, are downright unattractive in multiple ways, and  are considers creeps by literally everyone who interacts with them. 


Our Omega is a 2. TRP welcomes all men with open arms and will try to help them. 

In theory TRP could work for them, but there no advice for guys who are starting from zero. 

How do you teach someone how socialize and flirt through a Reddit post? It's almost impossible.  


2-3 years of consistent effort and these guys will go from a 2 to 5. All that work to get mediocre women our AFC was running from . 

And these guys will see no fast results. Girls don't care if the obese guy has swag. Your newbie gains can't compensate for your social anxiety  . They get no positive feedback until they reach the minimum of 5. 


Any new trick or theory they learn from TRP can only be tested years after they see it. The AFC can test it out when he goes out or even on his GF/wife. Maybe an Omega can try it out some girl he's orbited but that's about it. It'll be months of improving himself and learning the basics before he can test TRP.

Even on the topic orbiting the advice should differ. If the Omega has literally one girl in his life, maybe he shouldn't ""next"" her. That's the only socializing with a girl he has. He should practice what hes learnt on her. Our normal beta can find another girl hence he can ""next"" her. 

You'd have to make an entirely new sub for guys who need to get from 2-5.  Then they can graduate to TRP.

**Here I explain the rise of the Blackpill**

The balding, 5'3,  Indian ~~janitor~~ programmer has found TRP. They've always been on Reddit. Reddit was built for these guys.  

This guy will be never be Chad. But TRP will give him hope. And he will be disappointed.  

The OG RP dude bros just didn't quite understand what they were dealing with when they tried to save Redditors . ECs would  tell them to talk to girls and these guys would ask how. ""What do you mean how? Just flirt like you usually do"". Poor asktrp ECs probably never realized they were talking to Omegas. 

Eventually the manlets, autists and  indians/asians realized that even if they did everything TRP said they wouldn't get the results of someone with a better starting point. 

Hence The BlackPill was born - Genetic Determinism the ideology. Some guys simply have lower ceilings.

Some guys will never reach 7.5 and get to date stacies and plate beckies.  Some guys peak at 5. 

""All that work just to be average? lol "" These bottom tier guys all denounced TRP and made their own subs. However one thing they  took from TRP was pushing women off pedestal. They did that perfectly.

This what ultimately lead to the death of TRP.  All the AFCs came improved and left, leaving the dregs of Reddit. The ECs struggled with the omegas who believed they had potential; who eventually graduated. And the omegas who felt they'd never make it  denounced The RedPill and took The BlackPill",1

2901,2902,"Dear Pratik,  
Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men
and humanising terrorists and what not. The cultural values you keep referring
to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially
in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape
accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed  
two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is
exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing
a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know
feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said?
As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's
family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage
with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a
girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively
because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a
heroic romance then god bless you. God save you.

4443,4444,"Women have zero interest in sex *compared to a man*.

Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general.

Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex.

If they did, society and culture would look completely different.  Even in ""modern"" super liberal attitude countries you see it.  Women just aren't into it.

Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date.  You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience.  Women wouldn't whine about ""cat calling"".  Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women.

If women pursued  sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on.

And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life.  So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't.  Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts.

Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors.  Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero.  if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that.  Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them.

Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do.

Women don't give a shit about sex.  Not really.  they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that?  Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole.

Whereas women don't think a hard cock is a hard cock, which is why they have 500000 requirements to fuck, whereas a man just requires a woman to be willing and available.",1

MMSLP  Got horny just by imagining doing all the things there. Shit, I need to lift now.

The rational male Year One  Oneitis, plates, game, hypergamy, frame so much wisdom there.  

NMMNG - I understood I have been a nice guy for life. I learned to listen and to be more assertive during conversations. Listen more.

The Game - it was an insightful book. I was expecting a guy bragging on how easy he picks up girls. I read an inner trip with lots of useful reflections.

Steel's Guide to Married Red Pill  It will be a long journey for a career beta like me.

MRP Beginner's Guide for the Career Beta  I want to read again in a few months and be proud of how far I have gone.

Currently reading: not really reading, just latest posts in MRP and askMRP, I have too much things to do to catch up with my goals  

Reading queue:

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius  I kind of like stoicism. Getting worried about mundane things is like when a small baby have a tantrum over a random toy.

The Mindful Attraction Plan (stalled)

Book of pook (stalled)

Audiobooks:

TWOTSM  I followed HornsOfApathys advice and I am listening to audiobooks while training. Book is inspiring, too deep/god focused, maybe I am still not ready, but I am enjoying the explanations.

**Myself:**

Confinement. Routine. Wake up. Kids tasks. Cook. Work tasks. Food. Train or not. Projects or laziness in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Hey, I built a wall. No, not an emotional wall you feelings-porn-seeker, a real one with bricks and mortar. For being a first time I feel really proud. I build things. I am a man now.

For the DoD challenge, I keep working out, diet is not soo bad and of course I shower and shave every day you disgusting faggots! Keeping house a bit better, but I need to do some tasks none of my children (including wife) feel responsible for. They will. Because I will guide them.

I have been busy with myself. Changes and habits take some time to settle, so I did not feel like writing weekly. It might sound like an excuse, but I did not want to repeat myself. Still, from time to time is good to write down to keep the pulse (and get some kick in the ass from wiser men).  

I own that I need to improve with the kids. I could be better and schedule better and be stricter and plan better and guide better but they are kids and are trapped here, so I let them slip a bit from schedule and be kids. Still, there is room to improvement and I will go for it. A bit stricter in the mornings and more playful in the afternoons, that will be me.

Time is scarce due to the fact that I am supposed to be working and dealing with kiddos at the same time, and this is not possible. So I work afternoons after wife comes back from the job.

I am still searching for my mission. By listening TWOTSM I had to stop lifting for a few minutes and list all the shit I like to do, I want to do, and there are a lot of things, but no real legacy yet. Nothing tells me go for it, they are still a bunch of long-term things I want to do. I will choose some things and see if it brings me to a better sense of mission.  

**Current goals:**

* Reach 1000 lbs club: deadlifting heavy is the best feeling I have in life. I cannot explain it but if I had to do a personal record or fuck, I would go for deadlifting (iron oneitis?). Max 1RM theoretic calculations put me in 800. I will try when it says 1100.
* Play guitar. And sing. I will be a rock star. Yeah I also dont believe it, but it is fucking fun.
* Be consistent with my working, training, household, etc. I need to put it as a goal because being the best me is part of my mission.

**Relationship:**

I am surprised on how unemotional I have become regarding my relationship most of the time. No, really, not angry anymore, no fear or whatever. I was over-sensitized lately and jumping at every bone. I somehow dont care about many things that would have had me angry and emotional regarding the relationship. I kind of see shit tests and am sorry, what?, you expect me to react to that?. Old me would DEER and whine and justify and make things rational and explain and prove and try and on and on but new(TM?) me is kind of whatever IDNGAF. And the best is that I mean it. My relationship is still really important to me, but the explosions/situations of the moment are not interesting me at all.  

Too much shit to do to be bothered I guess I am now at 80% of the time with this attitude, 20% resentment. This 80% is not rambo, it includes  initiating, relaxed attitude dude this confinement has been a blessing in disguise for me. The 20% are still my insecurities and fears and still being angry for not getting the treatment I deserve and fuck the noise, I just STFU and it disappears after some time. I am kind of relieved I am not in the emotional roller-coaster anymore.  

We are still not talking about us, but I am not sure I want to taaaaalk anymore. We share time together, play with the children, have some interesting non-relationship conversations, watch some serial together, pair of sexy times a week (I want more, and I dont get butthurt when rejected most of the time)... a standard blueish relationship. If she is fucking around or hiding things/lying is her fucking problem, fuck her (I still have oneitis, so I am trying to fake it until I make it). Not where I want to be, but far better than before. I take my time for myself and she is not the center of the universe, the center of the universe is again that marvelous land called Fraggle Rock or me, better me.  

**Lifting:**

\#60DoD  Weights are improving. I was lying to myself in the first OYS about my weights, this is where I though I was. Well, I was not close, I injured myself because I was too proud to lower the weights and do proper form, recovered and now my lifts are where I really am, proper form and at a minimum x5. I am fine with that and getting in a good shape.  

Doing Phraks Greyskull LP Variant and adding some shoulder and back exercises alternating days, plus some abs.  

Still a bit of fat, but I look better in pictures than two months ago. I had not decided in my last OYS if reducing body fat or going for increasing strength. I will go for the strength, I felt miserable when I tried to cut calories. And the mirror shows me a better body now, so even at the same BF% there is a huge difference.

**Diet & habits:**

I feel better and more energetic when I eat in a surplus. I will not go go-mad, but will keep calories high for now.  

I stopped cigarettes completely. They are disgusting now. Weed is reduced to evenings with wife, but I am also cutting that from last night (not even a goodbye joint, I stopped already). I dont drink, so I will go back to weed for recreational purposes, but I need at least a full clean month before considering that for now.  

I have enough rest, but I am not sleeping my 8 hours. I need to schedule myself better now that I am really doing things.  

**Financial:**

We share expenses. No change here. I started to do projects with the computer. Nothing that can create money yet, but the skills I need to build them will put me on the right track.

**Social:**

With the virus outbreak I am isolated at home with the kids. That is making social interaction scarce. Some video calls at work and with groups of friends, but they are not the real thing.",0

When you say something like this, a girl will by default feel like a loser if she's your something casual if she was raised even remotely decently. (Or even if like your girl, she was raised by the streets and is now wary of guys like you.)  

Maybe you say it because you want to be honest, or maybe you say it because it gets you off to emulate some FR you read on here. 

But realize that the game for a woman is commitment, and by outright shutting the possibility of her success down without supplanting it with a new fantasy (IE: How amazing being casual with you would be,) she ends up needing to do a lot of emotional labor to hamster what she's doing with you.

I have found civil rights leaders from all sorts of movements but especially anti-racist and anti-colonialist movements super inspiring. Womanists, the largely black PoC women who led the intersectional movement, guided my growth and understanding of how to act right, and all errors I make are my own. 

I found treating the women that grew up rooted in sexism with respect paid dividends. Women have always found ways to live around sexism, whether they acknowledged it or not. Even the most hide-bound culture has ways for people to let off steam. It may not be worth preserving, necessarily, but it is worth understanding.

You may find that you are the person best placed to write or speak about feminism in your home country, or intersectionality in your adopted country. But you dont have to do anything, and you are not alone, not ever. Even if there are few out and out feminists in your home country, there are surely more women who are sympathetic to it; native feminists in your adoptive country may not understand directly, but if theyre half decent and your friends theyll set themselves to understanding. 

Some groups I think you might have luck feeling at home with are 1) other women who have migrated from your home to your adopted country; 2) feminists from countries neighbouring or similar to your home country; 3) groups of immigrant feminists, without specific countries of origin, because some experiences are common.

843,844,What is the point of pretending like you really dont know youre pretty when you get asked out every day and get laid or hookup almost every day/week?Every Stacy I knew had this experience when I was in hs. Im also sick of Beckies and Stacies being allowed in here and on the ask subreddit. Do we really need their humble bragging experiences of being asked out every day and having guys beg to sleep with them?,1
4737,4738,"Do you think breasts are inherently sexual?Sorry if this sounds a bit scattered, I'm just writing a stream-of-consciousness about my thoughts on this right now. This question has been haunting me for many years. I remember this one time I was at the beach when I was young and I was watching the boys around me wearing just their swim trunks and how free it must feel not to have to wear a top, and I felt this sort of painful longing. I felt sad that girls just couldn't do that, because boobs are ""inappropriate"".

Now that I'm older, I have many more thoughts about this. I still feel the painful longing I felt when I was younger whenever I see men just being allowed to have their shirts off and not have to cover their nipples. And I just wonder, why is it that boobs are seen to be nearly as sexual, if not *just* as sexual, as genitalia? There is really no difference between male nipples and female nipples except for the female breast's function to breastfeed, which requires more fatty tissue.

My theory on this is that women's bodies are just so objectified and oversexualized in every way that even body parts that seem biologically and inherently sexual really *aren't*. Rather, everyone in (at least western) societies have become socialized to cater to the male gaze, which views women through a lens that hyper-sexualizes women for male benefits. I do not think that female breasts are inherently sexual; rather, our response to viewing breasts in a purely sexual way is a result of being trained over and over and over that breasts are for men's sexual viewing pleasure. We have sexualized women's breasts so much that women cannot even breastfeed their children in public, a normal biological need, without being hyper-sexualized and condemned.

Theoretically, I think it is possible for women's breasts to be seen as just as nonsexual as men's are. It will take many, many years of deconstructing the male gaze and removing men from the position of the ""default"" human being (thereby removing marginalization), but I think it can happen. For the most part, I believe we have a choice of which body parts we choose to sexualize or not sexualize (besides *maybe* genitalia). For instance, biologically, cis straight women overwhelmingly prefer men with larger shoulder to hip ratios, but you do not see men's shoulders being covered up and hypersexualized. I do not think that is because men's shoulders are actually ""less sexy"" than women's breasts; rather, I believe it is because most societies have been designed for men, with men being the ""viewers"" and women being the ones who are viewed. And so, men's preferences and decisions on what is ""sexy"" or not have taken precedence and are thought of as being universal, while women's desires and what body parts they view as sexy on men are mostly silenced or not recognized to be as sexy as any body part women possess, because women are, as we have been trained, inherently sexual, while men are not.

In general, sexualizing women's nipples while not sexualizing men's nipples creates an imbalance where women are taught to be inherently ashamed of the body they possess because it is automatically ""sexual"", while men are taught that their body is the normal, default body that is allowed to view women as objects for their sexual viewing pleasure.

Whoops, this was a lot longer than I meant it to be. But I'm curious, what are your thoughts on this?

**TLDR:** I believe women's breasts are over-sexualized because we have been socialized to view women through a male gaze which believes women's bodies to be inherently sexual. This, in turn, sexualizes body parts that are not actually sexual. I think it is theoretically possible to desexualize women's breasts in time, when men are no longer deemed to be the ""default"" human and society is not designed solely for men's benefits and desires.

**Edit:** I also want to add that I am bisexual and nonbinary (AFAB). While I find women's boobs to be sexually attractive, I do not think of boobs *only* in that way and I do not think of women as being inherently sexual objects because of their bodies. I would have no problem living in a world where women can walk around with their tops off, because boobs are beautiful in ways that are more than just sexually, and so are women as a whole. I think boobs are a body part like any other, and they definitely can be sexy, but they are not aggressively inherently sexual and inappropriate like we have been ingrained with. Society has an undeniable problem with looking at women as parts rather than as people.",0

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time. If she is chasing your validation she won't give a fuck about her faggy coworker. Flirting is fun and females love attention. If you're giving her too much attention it won't mean anything to her and she will seek it thru other sources. Dread game is goat.

4033,4034,"She'll never tell you what she really means.I come back to this sub after a 2 year hiatus of regular dwelling. I checked in from time to time, but I never stopped reading books, learning and improving myself.  
  
First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

4266,4267,"Cried in my Zoom Class todayWhy do people have to be so cruel and nasty? I suffer the reverse halo-effect. People always assume that I'm retarded & think I'm weird/ annoying.  I make people physically uncomfortable. 

My class had a debate on zoom today, and I struggled with public speaking (as usual). One girl had her microphone on & she laughed at me when I stuttered for a moment & forgot my argument. Everyone in my class thinks I'm massively retarded, and they will speak over me or completely ignore me. 

During the debate this one guy kept picking on me and being rude/ condescending. I noticed a stark difference in the way he spoke to me v.s the prettiest girls in class. It is pure suifuel, & makes me feel like complete shit

Our professor asked us how the debate went at the end of class. This one girl from my group (who really dislikes me) openly stated that ""certain people"" in our group are ""incredibly frustrating"" and she ""couldn't stand"" listening to them. Those were her words, almost verbatim. Everyone just laughed...but it was clear she was talking about me. There are only THREE ppl in our group. I don't know why she had to be so nasty and passive aggressive. I am nothing but nice to her. I guess ugly people are garbage though & worthy of no respect 

 I waited until the zoom session ended to speak with my teacher about my struggles with class participation/ public speaking. I immediately choked up and stated to cry before I could say 2 words. My teacher just sat there with this awkward smile on her face and asked if I wanted to ""come back in 2 minutes.""

We then had this INCREDIBLY awkward conversation. It felt like I was holding her hostage lol. Even my own teacher thinks I'm a creepy weirdo. I explained my autism & struggles with social anxiety, and she suddenly started talking about how many students find the course material"" unfamiliar"" and ""intimidating."" She couldn't understand why I was upset..... You should have seen how uncomfortable she was lol.

That was one of the most awkward moments of my life. She looked like she thought I was fake crying. I really wasn't though...I'm just that mentally unstable lol",0

(see https://reason.com/2020/05/15/aclu-betsy-devos-title-ix-rule-due-process/).

Male games who go outside love to talk about their favourite games, dont focus on what they hate and love to encourage people, no matter what gender, to play their fave games. Like the average person with a favourite tv show. Guys who speak about games online are just miserable mfers.

On the flip side, I've come across far more women virtue signalling ugly men online than I have in reality. A self pitying male irl doesn't really get more than an ""awww, I'm sure you'll find someone."" A self pitying male on Reddit will get ""awww no hun I find 3ft 700lbs guys super sexy. Sexier than Zac efron!!!!1""

Online gives room for people voice their true opinion but theres also bias towards the opinions of those who spend more time talking to strangers than they do socialising with friends.

But I wouldn't bother going to shortcels and mgtow for opinions. They're only interested in Stacies.

4369,4370,"A lesson I learned from a stranger on the busThis past winter, I was riding the bus consistently to a new job in a new city. I'm a nurse, and the transition was stressful, and the shifts were long and the mornings were dark, early, damp, and cold. There was a woman who would ride the same bus at the same time as me, and although we never exchanged a word, she has made a lasting impact on me, and I find myself thinking of her often. I wanted to share my experience with you ladies. 

This woman was an average woman, likely in her 50s, with a rather plain face, plain clothes, and sometimes rather disheveled. She often sat across from me, with muddy rain boots, and hair slightly askew from wind and rain. Every other person on the bus was either sleeping, or on their phone, scowling, irritable, and cold. 

But this woman wore a smile. Her expression was always soft, inviting, friendly, and she had a peaceful presence about her that was mesmerizing and downright fascinating. She was beautiful, warm, and kind. She never looked impatient, she never scowled down at a phone screen, she would not look away when I met her gaze but would smile sweetly at me, and I would smile back. We shared these rides together in silence, and I found myself smiling too. I would look out the window as the first traces of light came up through the treetops, and I would find stillness in an otherwise stressful commute. 

Then, as weeks passed, I noticed a shift in my own behavior. I noticed myself smiling at work, among coworkers who were stressed, anxious, and exhausted. I noticed that I could make the people around me laugh, and smile too, and maybe even complain less. My patients seemed to smile more as well,  despite their suffering and fear. I noticed that I would catch myself smiling while standing in line at the grocery store, or while doing the dishes, or weeding. I would smile in the car, when going on rides with my partner.

And as the world has changed through this pandemic, as people have begun social distancing, and fearing not only the virus but one another, smiles have seemed to disappear altogether, mask or no mask. 

Whether you cover your face or not, smile more. Smile for yourself, smile with your eyes. It will change your life, it might change someone else's. It is feminine, it is gentle, it is kind. It seems we need more of that these days than ever.",0

Others may post pictures for the sole purpose of getting people to ""like"" it and compliment them. No one with high self esteem would need that much attention from people. Both cases indicate someone with low self esteem in my opinion. I knew a handful of girls in highschool who had a lot of instagram followers and what not yet they had horrible self esteem for whatever reason. Not getting enough likes on a picture would cause them to delete it. Please keep in mind that just because YOU view someone as a normie or a becky or whatever does not mean that other people do or that the person you are referring to even thinks they are.",1

If I held that spider to get over my fear, and it bit me or jumped on to my face, I would be even more afraid than before cause I would have verified my fear is rational. If someone who is afraid of women was told just do it with no social skills, they will have a bad experience and further push them away from approaching. Theres a process that needs to happen well before actually trying to overcome the fear. It may seem silly to you to be afraid of women, but it is a genuine fear a lot of men have and I dont think that telling them its irrational is the best way to go about it because they will not want to talk about their fear anymore and not seek help or guidance.",0

If men are already the main danger to women and service is mandatory, then having only men do it actively REDUCES the safety of women in society, since now men are not only physically stronger and much fitter due to having spent several months if not years working on physical fitness, they're also trained in how to control, subdue, and even kill people.

>given we have two guys with equal looks the guy with better social skills is always gonna win

Sure I agree with you. But most of the times people aren't equally good-looking in which case the better-looking guy is always going to win because personality won't compensate for looks.

>being a shut-in introvert your entire childhood puts you at a massive disadvantage in dating

How? 80% of rejections happen in the first 5 seconds of an interaction. You can immediately see the way a girl responds to you in the first few seconds if she's gonna let you flirt with her or not. If she doesn't like the way you look she's just gonna give you one-word replies, put on a bitch-face and have negative body language. Good luck flirting with that.

Inb4 'you had the posture of a person that was a shut-in introvert 10 years ago so that's why she rejected you within 5 seconds'.

1047,1048,"I've got similar issues. I grew up with no siblings and parents who showed zero PDA, even in the home.

>I cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves.

I've learned that they're never going to give signs that they want physical moves. They will only give signs they *don't want* physical moves. If you are close to her and she leans back, she's not ready yet. If she doesn't, you can move to the next step. If she has some kind of accessories on her wrists or fingers, lightly touch her hand/wrist and ask about them. She'll probably be okay with that, so move to the next step. Lightly brush her hair and compliment her on it. If she doesn't move her head back, you can continue moving up. If she does give a *no* signal, go back one or two steps, then work your way from there again. That's basically how it goes.

Now what helps me easing into getting more touchy is creating excuses. If she's wearing heels, take her down a route with some stairs, and lock your arm into hers for ""support"". Go roller skating and take her hand. Teach her how to shoot pool or throw darts--anything that involves touching and moving parts of her body, under the guise that it's not *only* sexual touching. Kinda like innuendo in speech.

One thing I'm keen to try, is at the first meet going for a handshake and instead bring her hand up to kiss it. I live in Japan, and 98% of the female population here goes apeshit over Disney prince/princess crap, so I'm curious how it would play out. From there I could probably go straight to holding hands.",0

A lack of high earning men will cause women to focus on their careers instead of finding a husband.  I believe this study was discussed here in the past:

A man's wealth is directly correlated with how women rate him.  A similar effect the other way around is small to non existent.  Men select for looks and personality.  Women select, quite literally, for looks and money:

A loss of income is the single largest predictive factor for a wife wanting to divorce her husband.  The same is not true the other way around.  And interestingly, a wife's inability or refusal to ""cook and clean"" does not effect a husband's willingness to divorce her, either.  I'm not sure if this study goes into this, but my guess is personality issues, things like nagging and harassment, might be the biggest factor for husbands:

Multiple studies show that most women aspire to have easy careers, work part time, or otherwise be a stay at home mom supported by a husband.  I've seen estimates from ~65% and up.  This one is 84%:

######https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/

There is a study showing that most men (around 65%) would prefer to be stay at home dads / husbands, so there isn't much of a gender difference here.  Most people regardless of gender prefer to stay home over working a job.  Many would even call it a *privilege*.

Women just have significantly more power and control in the dating and marriage market, so they tend to get their way more often.  In fact there's a plethora of research showing that wives and girlfriends command significantly more power in relationships than men do.  I'll leave those out for the sake of brevity (and for veering outside the scope of the OP) but I can post them if requested.",1

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls. Don't tell her about them but let her see that the cashier at the store finds you attractive. Subconsciously it will fuck with her big time.

Meanwhile men have a laundry list of preferences, standards, and REQUIREMENTS for womens physical beauty. 

Some of their preferences are breast size/shape, nose size, WHR, hip width.

And the most common argument the short guys have is well you cant change height!! 1. You cant change the above things unless you are willing to risk your life, take time off from work and lose money, and drop >5k on implants or surgery, which guys shame you for anyways. 2. Why does it MATTER that you cant change your height? Ok? Should women immediately be sympathetic because you have an unfixable feature and start to have a preference for it? 

Its double standards. Im glad theres a feature for men to widespread be insecure about. Because women are picked apart and microscopically dissected for their features. Men dissect an oblivious woman walking by, with their friends as a social pastime. Its disgusting.

3570,3571,"I moderate a large subreddit. Some time ago, we decided to stop letting people use gendered slurs entirely. No bitch, dick, or pussy. No whore, no slut, no man-ups, no man-child, no fuckboy. The results were the following: 

* A lot of people got mad about the policy (and still do)
* Everyone got nicer
* All the comments got more constructive
* The amount of whining about the gender double-standard went way, way down and people focused on these specifics of the situation. 

I honestly didn't expect this to work. Never in my dizziest daydreams did I think this would have much of an impact. But it *did* have an impact. I've actually spent quite a bit of time thinking about why that might be. 

I think that when people use a gendered slur as shorthand and then you take it away from them, they won't rephrase it to the exact same level of vitriol because they don't necessarily mean *that thing they said*. When people stop being able to ask, ""Am I just being a bitch"" and have to ask the question another way, they typically don't go to the most derogatory counterexample. Rarely it is rephrased to ""am I just being angry and controlling for no reason"". They have to clarify what they think being a 'bitch' means, and that could be controlling, manipulative, assertive, mean-spirited, cruel, or crazy. I might also mean a better meaning like, ""Are my expectations unreasonable?"" or ""Am I asking too much to expect that my partner ___"". 

The way people respond to those two questions is dramatically different too. People often will echo ""Yes, you're a bitch"" back, but they will answer ""Am I being unreasonable"" with ""No, boundaries are important"". Gender bias plays out in this situation like you wouldn't believe. People who are disinclined to support a woman who might be being a ""bitch"" to their partner (even if the specifics of the situation are the exact same) will support respectful boundaries, clear communication, and taking responsibility in the next breath. Similarly, telling someone to man-up is actually really unclear advice. What does that mean? What does one *do* if they actually want to man-up? A large percentage of the time, that evolves into ""Sit down and have an honest conversation about your feelings"" which, I think you'll agree, is a weird definition of ""man-up"". 

What I find is that gendered slurs usually are a short-hand for a complex and largely unconsidered pile of baggage that everyone means and understands in their own way. You can still call someone an asshole, a piece of shit, a cheater, a loathsome creature, an emotional terrorist. You can still say terribly mean things about people without using gendered slurs. You actually don't say much when you tell someone to man-up, quit being a pussy, stop being a fuckboy. When you ask 35 people a day to reword that to make it something else, you realize that no one is really communicating with those words at all. They are just thought-terminating cliches for feelings people mostly never consider.",1

5911,5912,"@navya patil you are talking about whom then you are referring to men or
women. you are talking about human beings then who are human beings there are
two genders in human beings male and female like that in other species too. if
any person keep false allegations on a person who is innocent that person
becomes the enemy of the humanity.  
look. according to me there are two genders males and females that's it i
don't give a damn about third gender. i am anti lgbt person who will oppose
them because i feel they are huge threat to humanity all women and men will
suffer if they get corrupted.  
according to me feminist is about the rights of girls that it not about men at
all. all i care about humanity,nature,wildlife and animals that's it. always
fighting for equality for education is fine,jobs fine if you have potential to
take care of the pressure no problem go ahead, but if you don't want to change
initial after marriage that is not acceptable you should always be called of
your husband name or his initial which i don't agree if anyone oppose that  
asking for father share of property ok no problem. but if men can marry
multiple women doesn't mean women can marry i will always be against the idea
. fighting for rights in everything is not acceptable. equality in good things
is ok i have full support but not in bad things also. always don't imitate men
for everything. few things ok. always crying over men that women are not
getting justice saying this is wrong.  
if you have potential to take care of both career and family equally then no
problem go ahead. if you are not able to balance both then forget about job.
just take care of children because children can be raise properly by women
more than men. if you want to get divorce though your husband not done
anything wrong then forget about asking money from him. if you are earning
money good then you have no right to ask money from your husband if you are
getting divorced.  
i am not feminist at all i agree women should fight for equality for few
things not everything. if men can do why can't we do. now men are drinking and
smoking try to stop them and don't become like them. if men are bribing try to
stop them don't do the same thing. if men are going for casino try to stop

**TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.**

if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value.

men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that.

but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better.

I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women.

these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s.

so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked.

also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks.

so don't give a damn about other subs like gonewild, butterface, etc. while facial bone structure is really really important there are many cute-the-girl-next-door girls who would be seen ugly online while in real life they would be wanted.",1

If a girl seems interested when you text her, but then leaves you on read after a while, understand that its either this, or in all likelihood, you arent the only guy she is talking to. (Shocker, I know.) I dont typically entertain girls who send one word replies, and then leave me on read after a while, in fact, Im usually the one who leaves the girl on read at this point, but if she is generally engaging, might be worth playing the long game. The best advice I can give though, dont double text on the same day, thats a mistake I made for a long time, and it was impulsive. It also helps to have them on multiple platforms, my last girlfriend for example, I finally got a first date with her through the Instagram DMs, and the rest is history.",0

Week6: Finances

I have been aggressively tackling credit card debt since last year. Im forecasting to be free of credit card debt NLT the end of this year. My student loan, is a different monster, but not too unwieldly, and I expect to pay it off within the following year or so.  


I am using Dave Ramseys Snowball + Debt Avalanche Method on paying off debt.  


So, what can be done during these DoD and going forward?  
1. I have at least a year and half or more remaining (at my current take home pay + side income) for debt payoff.Stick with my plan. Any extra income goes into paying off debt. More importantly, do not accumulate more debt.  
2. Prep. Ive begun mentally planning for saving for a down payment for a house. According to DR, I should be paying off debt first, but Ive heard otherwise, from other reliable sources. Either way, Id like to be rid of credit card debt, first.  
3. Budget. As with a lot of my problems, making a plan and sticking to it is my weakness. The problem right now is not overspending, its not controlling and managing where and to what my money goes.  
4. Control. Self-control is key. My wife is on an allowance and I should also put myself on an allowance to be honest, in order to more effectively tackle my debt and save.  


Week 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily. Week 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat.  
Week 3: Hygiene, Hair, Etc. Developing healthier routines.  
Week 4: Style: Updating current style. Prepping for summer and fall.  
Week 5: Game: Actively gaming wife. Still have yet to purchase a book on game, but have been following PoNs advice on game. Need to game randos.  


**Read:**TRM, NMMNG, MAP  
**Reading:** Cant Hurt Me, 'Bigger, Leaner, Stronger,NMMNG (BF activities), Atomic Habits  


**Career/Work:**  
*From last week:Asking myself how my work/career can contribute to my mission. How can I position myself to come out ahead after the dust settles with this Covid-19 situation? What do I want to do? Where do I see myself in x years?*  


I have an idea of where and how I want to live. How can/should I plan my career around this?  
I want my career to supplement my lifestyle, not the other way around. I.E. I have to live in the city, because thats where my office is AND commuting team is more bearable.  
Id rather live in a location and house that I love, and have a job/business that compliments/works well with that.  


**This week:**

Ive been enjoying the time off doing necessary stuff around my apartment, getting ready for the upcoming summer. Prepping kids to sleep in their own room, study, and just going through the motions. It all feels like one big blur. I cant remember what the fuck I did last week. I havent been writing in my journal as I should. Im still a lazy faggot.  


I did fuck up my work out routine this past week, as it was my wifes birthday. I slept in, ate shit, and didnt work out as I shouldvebummer. I have very little discipline, still. My nutrition plan is okay at best, but I make too many exceptions in other areas. Ive realized that I dont have the self-control or discipline it takes, yet, to cut loose a little bit, then be back on the grind the next moment.  


So I really need to create environments, according to Atomic Habits, where I set myself up for success. Id love to hear from you guys on how you dealt with a lack of discipline or built more self-control.  
*Kids:*   
One area I am constantly failing in, is patience with my son. I love my boy, and I understand that if I dont unfuck myself I could inadvertently create a Nice Guy who hates his father. This upcoming off-period, I am going to actively focus on being patient and better with him.  


**Further thoughts:**  
Discipline. Self-Control. Priorities.  


**Pain is Weakness leaving the body. Onward.**",1
863,864,"So... Would you girls say that mentalcels are invalid, or at least not supposed to be here? I for example carry scars from my femcel days. Can't function normally and still involontary celibate because of it. I think that when i vent about it here, it is sometimes taken as an insult, or like i'm humblebragging.

And a part of me completely understands, although i wish it weren't like that. Because i know if i had had this sub back when i was ugly and bullied, i would have been angry at Beckies and Stacies posting here as well. Most likely.

 I am just asking a question, not trying to argue with anyone's feelings. I don't want to annoy anyone with my presence. I wonder if a sub for mentalcels would be better? Our struggles are different after all. I personally feel at home here, when i read femcels i see myself years ago, and i relate to the anger (i still have it in me). But i feel that i may ruin the feeling of being in a safe space for some girls. And i don't want that, obviously... I just don't know where else to talk.",1

4450,4451,"Yes. Maybe, and men only have themselves to blame. 

To answer your first question, research in the US shows older widows return from grief more easily than widowers, because women are more likely to hold the burden of keeping social networks alive. ([Source 1](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/56/1/S56/546685) [Source 2](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=widower+loneliness&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DBPk5Uv_P2e4J)). When their husbands pass, theyre far more likely to have their network to lean on and come comfort them. What do you think happens to the husbands whose wives arranged their social calendar for the last 30 years?

Toxic masculinity dissuades boys from working with their friends to process emotions. Whereas women and girls *define* friendships by how vulnerable they can be with each other. 

So, men grow up thinking a romantic relationship is the space where you can be open about your emotions. Oftentimes they dump all their lives emotional baggage on their partner, which is bad for the female partner who expects to *share* this work. But worse, how many years can a man go without that space where he can process how hes dealing with life stress? 

If a man never learns the tools to process everyday emotions, and never had a friendship where they felt open doing so, I have no doubt they can turn bitter and violently lash out at women.",0

1357,1358,"[Repost] Unattainbles - A Core Element of Masculinity**tl;dr  won't usually do this for you, but this one is easy**

Simply put: In order for a man to be happy and at peace, he must have a presently unattainable goal.


------


Let's jump right into it. Your personal deficiencies are going to be very different from the other guy (and your past self as you grow up and evolve). To expound on the second point, what I cared about at 17 was of the utmost importance to me at 17, but has no relevance to me now. Likewise, my expectation of achieving the goals I set for present-day me would be outrageous at that time.

That means in plain English that my mission in life at 17 was as follows:

* Graduate high school
* Hold on to the relationship with my girlfriend

My unattainable at 17 was:

* Get into my ""dream"" college  

When the unattainable is achieved, something new must take its place. **Failure to do this creates existential agony until an appropriate obstacle is in place to calm that nerve once again**. What do I do now when I achieve what felt like the unattainable? I invent a new unattainable. However, this lesson took some time to learn.

My college mission was as follows:

* Break up with high school girlfriend
* Make grades
* Rush the fraternity I wanted to be in

My unattainable at the time was as follows:


* 


Yep, nothing. This is where my journey stalled. I never bothered to think past my last unattainable into a new one! After all, I had already done the impossible. I was perfect and needed no further improvement in my mind.

I briefly got back together with the high school girlfriend long distance. It was, as my football coach put it, an ""other than positive experience"". See the problem?

----

This applies to men of literally any age. I use a teenage example because it will resonate with boys and men alike, but the message is the same: whether your limitations are sex, money, power, wealth (believe me, that is different than money), or fame (a thing many people hamster into attaining the other 4 aforementioned), you need to understand that without some seemingly unattainable goal to strive for you will never continue to be a man.


The core act of being a man involves becoming a different man worthy of surpassing self-defined milestones. The unattainable should be a combination of ""a thing you've never done before and have limited hope of achieving RIGHT NOW"" and ""things men you admire and respect have done before"". 

Fortunately for our dear readers, many are probably major losers right now. This unattainable can be as low as ""kiss a new girl"" or ""earn a promotion / earn $46,575 a year"". THIS IS A GOOD THING. Your self-actualization depends on actually achieving these goals, *just not in your current mindset, body, or frame.*

For the avoidance of confusion, your current mission should be:

1. Specific
2. Measurable
3. Attainable
4. Relevant 
5. Timely

Your current unattainable may or may not be any of these things - you have the freedom to decide. The only requirement is that the unattainable must be grand enough that you are currently unworthy. Hold yourself to this principle, and you will evolve rapidly into the man you want to be.",0

3310,3311,"What is your opinion on John Stoltenberg's view that masculinity and femininity are artificially created concepts that should be abandoned entirely? He also believes that masculinity as a concept is inherently toxic (I'll get into the details below, he did an interview where he explains why)In case you didn't know, he describes himself as a radical feminist. He did an interview with Vice.com where he goes into more detail on his views on this topic, but I think I can summarize them pretty well in this post. [Here's his full interview with Vice if you to know his view on this issue in greater detail](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/zmk3ej/all-masculinity-is-toxic&ved=2ahUKEwjbmcu_5fnoAhXDTN8KHQ12B80QFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1cB20RqEciXqCreKtu6mEY&ampcf=1). I recommend reading it.

Basically his argument is that traits and qualities associated with masculinity or femininity are just human qualities that any individual might have, man or woman. Men can be shy, quiet, emphatic, etc. and women can be violent, aggressive, prideful, etc. John think's it's unfair that some of these qualities are associated heavily with one gender or the other, and that qualities such as empathy and kindness are universal human qualities that should not be genderized or viewed as feminine. Likewise, women can be violent too, and as such violence should not be viewed as solely masculine. All these traits should just be viewed as human traits. I pretty much agree with this point of view.

However, he argues that the main thing that distinguishes masculinity and femininity (as social concepts/ideas/roles) is that masculinity promotes violence and aggression, while femininity does not. As such, he argues that masculinity as a social concept is inherently toxic, because masculinity promotes harmful behaviors that femininity doesn't promote. Even though he believes that toxic behaviors like violence and aggression are not inherent qualities of men or women, he believes that that traits and behaviors promoted by masculinity are generally more toxic than those promoted by femininity. Still, he thinks masculinity and femininity as concepts should be done away with.

(romans 1 - new international version) ...... ""for since the creation of the
world god’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been
clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are
without excuse.  
  
21 for although they knew god, they neither glorified him as god nor gave
thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were
darkened. 22 although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and
exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like a mortal
human being and birds and animals and reptiles.  
  
24 therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to
sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 they
exchanged the truth about god for a lie, and worshiped and served created
things rather than the creator—who is forever praised. amen.  
  
26 because of this, god gave them over to shameful lusts. even their women
exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 in the same way the
men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust
for one another. men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in
themselves the due penalty for their error. furthermore, just as they did not
think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god, so god gave them over to a
depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. although they know
god’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not
only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice
them."" .... and this one, you can put wherever you want ....... who said that,

issue, it's a human issue. too many men and women are hating the opposite
gender because there were so many reported rape cases and unreported false
rape accusations. this is highly toxic and avoids looking at the issue
objectively. kudos to the effort. it's not men against women, it is men and
women together to bring light to issues caused by other men and women.",0

Agreed. It's amusing how many men don't ask out pretty girls because ""there's no way she'll go out with me."" Maybe, maybe not. Take things as far as you can and let *her* be the one to stop you. Don't stop yourself dumb dumb. 

>We do this by judging girls and calling them sluts if they sleep around

This one gets me too. So many guys try to sleep with pretty girls, and then when they don't, they'll get pissed and call em hoes or sluts or whatever. If you want girls to hookup with you, then why are you shaming them for hooking up? 

>the frame of curiosity.

**Breaking Free Activity 7:** can people see my imperfections and still love me? How would I be different if I knew the people I care about would never leave/stop loving me? 

* On an intellectual level yes but it doesnt feel that way. What else is there to love other than how I give to them and if I have imperfections then I am giving less. The bit about people being attracted to another persons life energy resonated with me, I used to have that but I seem to have lost it to a large degree. The work Im doing here is bringing it back. 
* I would say what I thought, I would express myself authentically, I would not consider how they would react before speaking. I wouldnt pass everything through the will it piss them off filter, I would not try and prove how useful I am, I would just act in line with my authentic self rather than towards getting a specific action from them. 

**Breaking Free Activity 8:** Validating behavior to stop/increase. 

* Im not in a relationship so that eliminated a lot of my normal validation seeking behavior. I picked seeking validation from women on apps as this is something I was working on anyway. I am cutting that out. 
* When I was doing it more, I felt distracted and like I was always chasing something. I was living outside myself and I felt pulled in all different directions. This was because I was responding to something external without any internal sense of direction. My whole being was reacting to the whims of how some random women reacted towards me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 9:** Something I wanted to do for myself. 

Struggled with this one, I have a lot of hang-ups about what I want to do. Being selfish seems a terrible thing to be. There are a bunch of sex things but Im worried that is validation at this point, do I want to fuck a 19 year old for validation or because I just want to? Probably both. 

* Get a nice car
* Get tailored suite + shirts 
* Fuck a 19 year old
* Rally driving course 
* Beach resort holiday 
* Allow myself to be what I am
* Camping on beach for a month 

Need to revisit this activity at some point, this list is pretty lame. 

**Breaking Free Activity 10:** affirmations.

The ones that work for me are listed below. I say these before bed during my 10min med. 

* I am lovable just as I am
* My needs matter
* I do not break
* I am my own judge  
* I am consistently improving myself and my life
* I am deeply connected to all things in life
* I let fear pass through me
* I focus and apply myself towards my goals 
* I like and respect myself 

**Breaking Free Activity 11: Go on a retreat alone.** 

During lockdown this is not viable. Having said that, I regularly spend time alone, camping alone etc and this is some of the most stress free and enjoyable time for me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 12**: Do you believe its ok to have needs? Do you belief people want to help you meet your needs? Do you believe this world is a place of abundance? 

* No to all three questions. 
* I remember hiding myself away as a kid and feeling embarrassed of needing anything emotionally. At the same time, I dont want to become more needy. Im not sure how to balance these two, I need to understand how to be self-reliant and not needy but at the same time recognize and act on my needs. 
* Re people meeting your needs, Im not sure what I think, really at the end of the day it is an exchange of value. If they get what they want from you they will give in return. 
* I think fear is at the root of my scarcity. I close up to the world to protect myself and so the world is closed to me. When I was a kid, there was money scarcity, I was given messages that having nice things (like a nice car) was selfish, when I was a teen/early 20s there was women scarcity (and money scarcity!) and now I have a general scarcity attitude. I am starting to open up from this, seeing there are plenty of women, friends and opportunities in life. Im still not there on the money.",0

New to the gender pay gap report for 2020 is analysis on the impact of lost wages on lifetime earnings.

Lost earnings narrow to $80,000 for the controlled group, but this is still significant, especially if you consider how lost earnings due to the gender pay gap would grow with compound interest if invested each year for 40 years.""

3544,3545,"how mgotw and redpill made me fearful of women and how I got out.Howdy ladies and gentlemen.

First of all I want to say that I never was an outright member of both movement. I agreed with some concepts and while I never fully drank the koolaid, it profoundly affected me and after 2 long years of being consumed by this ideology, I can finally say that I got it all out of my system. I write this with the hope that it can help others dealing with the same stuff that I've dealt with.

# The beginning

It all started when I was about 17/18-ish. During this time I used to browse 9gag a bunch and in there I would sometime read about people being screwed over, relationship wise. At the time I just thought ""shit happens"", but those posts would come again every now and then.

My downfall really started on quora and reddit. A big difference between 9gag and these 2 Websites was that the posts didn't have character limits. Quora questions like ""how you found out that your xxx was cheating on you"" and subreddits like r/Relationships would lead to posts with lengthy explanations as to how people (usually men) would be cheated on in the worst way possible. I remember how I would spend entire afternoons scrolling and scrolling and this made me extremely anxious.

My current situation was as follows: Overweight, virgin, no friends and my self confidence was at an all time low. Just to make you understand how bad it was, I loathed  and was fearful of calling delivery services / making appointments and I almost had a heart attack while asking for a summer internship over the phone.

# The redpill and mgtow

This is when I started to discover the redpill. I watched channels like sandman and other mgtow related stuff and would start to lurk repill and mgtow subreddits. In the beginning it felt as if the pandora box was opened. They said that Women would cheat on you regardless of your value as a man and that they would milk you dry if you let them do it, and everywhere I looked, I would just find more stories that would confirm what I've read and heard from this redpill people.

Even though I was deep in the red pill, I still would have not considered myself to be an outright member of these group. You see, while I believed in hypergamy and the 20% / 80% stuff, I still couldn't buy the ""all women are like that"" mentality, both from a logical but also an emotional point. i.e. the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are men, but I never heard women saying anything about all men being child predators (as far as  i'm concerned). I also have a wonderful sister that is in a relationship and looking at them I would see the exact opposite of what the redpillers would say. She would often spend money on him, she took interest in what he did, etc. If my sister was like that then it wouldn't have been a far stretch to also believe that other women like my sister existed.

To be completely honest I wasn't angry at women, I was scared of them. I was scared that I could be cheated on, that if I got married, they would divorce me and take my stuff or that that she could have an affair and I would have raised a child that was not mine. To give you an example of how deep my paranoia went, I often played with the idea of having hidden cameras in my house, trackers in vehicles and taking paternity tests behind a potential partner's back just to be sure that I wouldn't not meet the same fate as the people who got fucked over.

# How I got out

Well, to be completely honest it was a multitude of things. First thing first, I deleted reddit and quora. This places were tainted to me and even nowadays I get somewhat nervous if I enter these websites. The next step was actually going my on way. Instead of listening to bitter and resentful people, I slowly  began to block their generalized opinion and actually started to build an opinion of my own. I started to hit the gym (lost 21 kg / 46 pounds) , learned to be impartial and to take any opinion with a grain of salt. More importantly, I started to be critical of my own beliefs. If I didn't have a sound logic to it, it had to go.

Now I'm 20 and I'm far more calm and retrospective person. I'm still a shy guy and still never had a girlfriend, but that's just what it is. I learned to not being so fearful of random people and more importantly pizza delivery services.

On Monday I will call a company to see if they will give me a another summer internship and to be honest, I'm already shitting my pants, but at least now I know that I have to face my fear instead of letting it dominate me.

cheers.

  
EDIT:

I called. It went good. Nothing official because of the current situation, but I'm confident I will get the place.

22M. I noticed that I suck at establishing physical connection with girls during dates and fail to show my romantic/sexual interests fast. So it ends up seeing like I either dont like them or I am just not confident to make moves. 

I (more or less) tick other boxes like eye contact, questions, confidence, jokes and teasing etc. But when it comes to physical escalation, my game SUCKS. 

Firstly, I am not a touchy person in general. Even with close friends or relatives, I prefer to go for handshakes rather than hugs.

How can I improve my physical escalation and make intentions more clear during first dates? I am
also careful trying not to kill the vibes if I go touchy and then she does not appreciate it. I dunno how to work on this.

**Physical**

I have to make some diet changes due to blood pressure rising again. Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast. I've acquired shoulder pain from having to substitute barbells for dumbbells in OHP. I had moved to dumbbells due to an unrepaired shoulder separation 35 years ago. Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy.

**Mindset**

After working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various ""victim"" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long.

**Relationship**

Wife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU. I had been doing ok with constant daytime banter and ""gaming"", but had to restart and rebuild after my incident. I had to consciously up the comfort, touch and praise. By Sunday it seemed like things were back to normal. And I'm taking my meditation time and practice with a renewed diligence.",0

It says:

*How do we not lose hope in finding love? How do you tell yourself that the right guy will come along when you don't really believe it? Why do you not believe that it could happen for you? Regardless of the insanity that we see out there today, love happens. People get married. People move in together. These things happen all the time. You don't have to be young, or beautiful, \[rich, famous\], in shape, enough to offer, or have a good credit score. If love happens for this one or for that one then it is possible for me. Whatever we have lived up to in our past, it does not indicate our future. You may want to revisit choices that you dismissed in the past.*

In the comments below the video, you can find an excerpt from the the despair of women over 25 (and certainly over 30):

*Im 46 years old and it has never happened for me.*

*Its really hard to believe love can happen for me when I have been waiting for so long. Its been 12 years since my divorce, and I am losing hope.*

*It has been 20 years since my divorce.  I've been with several dating agencies, and only had a couple of short - term relationships which have never lasted beyond a few weeks/months.  Just one that lasted about 15 months, but he turned out to be an alcoholic.  I've had a couple of dates just recently, but all he wanted was a friend ""with benefits"" .  I will be 70 this year so just want someone who will prove his worth before anything like that happens.  I'm not as confident about my body, as I was years ago.*

*Im a very affectionate caring loving women aged 35 , men tell me Im attractive all the time.  But I meet a guy we start to date , we get on great he says hes so crazy about me & finds me so attractive & caring and with in a few weeks( longest being 6 mths )the man says he doesnt want commitment & has no feelings for me . This has happen to me about 20 times over the past 15 years. So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it.*

*Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?*

I think that the lesson for women is quite simple.

Either they find a husband while still in their prime age, or else, they will soon end up in a desperate situation.

Of course, that does not change anything on the male side, which first and foremost may want to stay away from the gynocentric court system. So, if a woman is young and pretty, she may still be able convince a younger man, who at that point is still governed by his hormones, to ignore his red-pill lessons and sign up anyway, for a stint on the plantation. Older women are mostly toast, while the video tries to give them hope that they are not (but they do not seem to believe it, really).",0

&#x200B;

If youre like 95% of dudes, you either dont know or dont give a fuck about style. You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go.

You wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else.

For a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else.

And if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you.

You wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them.

You never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you.

Thats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style.

# What da Fuck is Style?

&#x200B;

**Its not about matching your belt with your shoes.**

&#x200B;

*Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.*

** Orson Welles**

&#x200B;

A High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him.

Why?

Because his style is a visual representation of who he is.

**It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.***

&#x200B;

*""Remind yourself. Nobody built like you, you design yourself.""*

**- Jay Z**

&#x200B;

# I'm too hot  - hot damn - Called a police and a fireman

&#x200B;

Your style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier  easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet.

Its a value add on on every level.

People will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it.

&#x200B;

*""It is both delusional and stupid to think that clothes don't really matter and we should all wear whatever we want. Most people don't take clothing seriously enough, but whether we should or not, clothes do talk to us and we make decisions based on people's appearances.""*

# Developing Your Style

&#x200B;

*Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.*

** Epictetus**

&#x200B;

Developing your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition  it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort.

The same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life.

And yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.*

Thats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think  fuck that dude looks good.

I cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style.

But there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process;

 

# Fit is King

It doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is  be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear  fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.***

You see it all the time  fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance.

None of this shit works.

So learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration  thats half the work done.

 

# Stick to the Classics

&#x200B;

*""I live for myself and I answer to nobody.""*

*** Steve McQueen***

You dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented  all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.*

[Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years.

If you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it  he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits.

Theres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish  all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen.

 

# Keep it Simple

*Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.*

Classic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics:

&#x200B;

***Colour.***

Your colour friends are  [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589)  black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown.

Thats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match.

&#x200B;

***Less is more***

&#x200B;

*All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret  the simpler the better.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

The 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of.

*You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.*

So learn to choose carefully  or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch.

# Steal from Your Icons

*One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

If you look at any famous creative people  musicians, artists, designers, film makers  none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.

Developing your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them. Then tweak it & develop it until it becomes your own. Its that simple.

# Show Me the Money

&#x200B;

*It is totally impossible to be well-dressed in cheap shoes.*

** Hardy Amies**

&#x200B;

Why spend 100 bucks on a [polo shirt](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/embroidered-cuban-collar-polo-shirt-mens-vega-in-ecru-cream/?category_id=1111&gaEeList=M%20-%20Tops) when you can get 8 for that price? Well, the answer is easy  for 100 bucks, you get quality in terms of design, materials and fit that will last. For 12 bucks, you get a [poorly fitting polo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Lavendar-XX-Large/dp/B07N4P9DS6/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=polo+shirt&qid=1585770945&sr=8-8) made from low grade materials that looks like it cost 12 bucks and - after a few washes - is worthless. One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you.

The difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1). These are two areas where you simply cannot skimp on. [Cheap shoes](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) kill any outfit stone dead. [Cheap jackets](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) are just as bad. Theres a reason why you pay more for leather, wool and cotton - its practically impossible to look good in man made synthetic materials like polyester, pleather and acrylic.

If you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear.

&#x200B;

**Shop online**

A retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need  good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why.

Youre also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain.

So shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe  youll never wear it.

&#x200B;

**Never Go Full Retail**

All designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack  wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites.

Other places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail.

Unfortunately, as you've probably realised, it's pretty much impossible to find genuine friends when you're trying. (Decent-looking people don't need to try, so never realise this LOL.) Best thing to do is try and improve your alone time, and dose yourself with bits of social contact (family, internet, etc.) for basic survival. 

If you're seriously desperate for some one-off social contact, talking about random shit in the Omegle spy question mode kept me above water for a long time. You just have to go through a lot of bots.

It's not about what you are, it's about those boxes others try to put you in and classify you as good or bad based on how well you conform to the set of rules of the norm that has been applied to you.  There isn't necessarily just one norm, there can be different norms enforced and approved by different groups.  If you don't conform to the jock norm, maybe you can conform to the punk norm and you fit in there.  We internalize the norms and use them to define ourselves and they also limit us and our expressions of who we are.  

In your example, you identified two different man norms, the first one is just a much softer norm.  Generally the more strict, oppressive, and coercive a sex/gender norm is the worse it is, and all norms are at least a little coercive.",0

It has many flaws. Read my comment properly",0
3419,3420,"Ooook, so, let's begin.
1. There is a difference betweet starving because of commies and capitalism. In capitalism, you have a real canche to get out of poverty, in commie, no.
2. Commies also start wars so, no strong point there. Taiwan? Tibet? Butan? Hong Kong?
3. Your ""propaganda"" is not real. China is solely at fault for Corona. Look at their culture. They eat dogs, cats, bats, koalas, snakes, etc and thet try to eat it as raw as possible because it is considered healthy. Well, that backfired, did it not with Covid? In this case: eating bats is not a good thing. Some cultures are better than others.
Still on propaganda: I can watch, listen and read pretty much everything in democracy, can even real Mein Kampf if I want, you can buy it but not in China.  Media must he aproved by the gov first, not cool.
The ""propaganda"" that you showed, it is in fact, reality. Sad to break your commie chinese love but reallity is reallity, just like TRP regarding woman. Get over the anger phase.
4. No, cult of personality is not raising someone as an example. Stop toying woth words, you start to sound like an SHW/Antifa. Cult of perso is when you are forcebly shoved in your throat a person. For example: Stalin, Hitler, Muso, Che, Fidel, the Kims of Korea, Hirohito in WW2, Mao, etc.
5. No, it is not bad, that's why we have universal free healthcare (at least in EU), free schools and colleges, police, firemans, housing program, car program.
People are not born and will not be able to be all equals, have same chances, this is by default. You might be good at math but I really suck at it, for real.
You might be bad at programming but I am a sharp tool in programming PLCs in Step7, TIA Portal and also designing electrical systems in Eplan. You and me are by default not equal. Equality in chanses, not really, again. Even with free healthcare, education and all, there can not be equallity. Stop this commie thinking please. Also, people do not like to be equals and the same. Not everyone wants a VW Passat, others want Seat Leon for example or Fiat.
Also, you want to be equal with Elon but Elon does bot want to be equal with you.
6 capitalism creates them naturally and by that I mean rich people just became rich because reasons. Commies just creates artificial rich people.
So you are a starter banker? If you are not in my close group of friends and not commie, nope, bye. The state wants you out of the elite plus you do not seems, subjectively, dedicated to the commie ideals.
Sorry man but you are really losing this discussion. Commie is bad for culture, humanity, science, etc. Whatever.
7. What other political parties are in China? Is there a liberal party? Conservatorist party? And I am talking in EU politic terms (USA is garbage with politics). Nope, only commies and if you do not vote commies, you are a bad, bad citizen, off to reeducation with you.
I am not in the USA sphere of thinking. We have opposition here that fights for it's causes. The democrat socialists were in power in Romania, they did terrible things and wanted to do more like pardoning people accused of corruption, fraud and money washing but the opposition managed to unite (liberals, technocrates, idk if i spelled it correctly, other socialist formation) and together with the people's protests, the social democrats felt. This is an example.
China? Nope, no opposition, no protests, nothing.
8 Yes, I am romanian and collectivisation left a huge wound and scar in our society and for me also. My grand grand father owned a lot of land that was productive, he was working it but when the commies vame to power, he was executed because he did not want to give hi's private property to the commies. After 24 years of commie downfall, my family managed to get back only 60% of our rightful lands.
No, collectivisation is not ok. It kills private innitiative, it keeps people poor, it keeps people in slavery, etc.
Stop thinking red. You are in TRP and you come with all this crap? Obesity is because people do not care what and how much they eat. Suicide rates in males is mostly because they are pussies and not being able to man up. Feminism, how it has affairs in collectivisation?
Yes, I oppose collectivisation so you can call me a bluepill beta male, I do not care. My wallet says other thing and the keys I have on my keyring also say other thing. Ask my lawyer also and he will say another thing regarding the rest of 40% of the missing property that will be gained back.
9. I will not comment on that, it just sounds so SJW retarded crap with social order. What do you even mean by that? Always explain yourself man when you are having a discussion with someone or an argument. Chill, I view this as a discussion and I would like to get more replies from you on this subject.
Regarding my point made for Godlike strict rules: no, I would not like such a system that tells me how to walk, what to wear, how to interract with people, what hairstyle shall I have.
The ""new man"" is bad because totalitarian regimes impose their view. In commie Romania, the commies envisioned that the new man (does not matter what sex you are) must be an engineer, architect, excellent at maths and exceptional scientists. There was no room for philosophers, artists, bankers, priests and other occupations related to those fields. Not good, a stable and functioning society needs everyone. From garbage collector, ticket seller, waitress, baker, banker, broker, aetist, philosofer, priest, stripper to engineers, mechanics, scientists, etc.
10. No, the roman republic =/= chinese republic. Do your homework please. USA, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, UK, Canada, Italy, etc are based on roman republics. China is just a dictatorship, a plain one.
11. No, there are no drones, spy camers, secret police, radar vans, etc in EU countries. In USA maybe, I do not know but in EU, nope. As I stated in this post previously, policits are totally different from USA and EU. Bernie is the only socialist in USA. The rest are conservators that are both in the left and right side which is impossible. Only Bernie can ve a lefty because socialism and communism in left. But again, I do not know much about USA politics. I view USA as being retarded. While the whole world uses metric system, they adopted their strange and confusing metrics in all aspects of life.
Wtf is a yard, gallon, mile, inch, fahrenheid (i am sure i spelled it incorrectly), lefties, righties in USA?
12 Well, if China was so rich like you said, why it did not made a huge national program for all people to have electric cars? Heavely reduce air pollution, ban kid labor, not affording more thay 1 kid in family, etc. Nope, even tho China is an economic giant, it's people are still poor.
Also, Germany's economy during A.H. was strong is fake. Nope, it was not an economic miracle. Hitler knew it and also he said it. That's one of many reasons he went to war, for hi's country not to economically fail in the next 5-10 years after '38. Please, just please, do not throw the ""but brah, da tankz"" because GE was not having that many tanks that others believed and also the tanks were crappy tanks. I would take a Sherman, Stuart, T34, SU, Firefly over any crappy Panther, Tiger, Toger 2, Elephant and also I would take a Spitfire and Hurricane over any german fighter until the jet ones.
13. Well, communism surely failed. It was present in so many countries during the Cold War and then it felt down.
South America, Africa and other capitalist failed countries do not represent an against capitalism point. It is important to see how they failed also.
I can say about Romania. It is a struggling capitalist country because 1. We did not know what capitalism is after 1989 so we are still learning what it is. 2. Our geopolitical position was against it. For cebturies we were invaded and razed by Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Russia, Austria. Can't really develop when your villages and small cities are razed, can you? 3. After 1989, people choosed neo commies and guess what neo commies did, they ruined the economy. Do you want details? I will give them if you want. In 2000, there was another chance. Between a nationalist, racist, commie hater, extremist and a commie hooligan, Romania choosed the commie. Vadim Tudor lost the elections because all ex commies allied against him and started a massive propaganda and spread fear (if he is elected, we all gonna die, executed, at gun point. He will lead us in chaos, dictatorship). The commies feared him because they knew that if Vadim would be elected, all ex commies would be shot, deported, jailed and monarchy would be reinstalled back in Romania under Michael the First.


Can you provide more sources claiming that US soldiers planted the virus in China besides UNZ?

As a resume: yes, commie is bad, no doubt in that and China created and exported Covid 19 by eating crazy stuff, more exctly in this situation: bats. I am not implying or advocating that China should be nuked, attacked with soldiers or anything but instead, China should apologise and take responsability for the situation and also stop being hyprocrites. Some cultures are just better than others my friend.


Edit: you claim to be red pilled but you are against it with commie loving ideas. If you look at TRP ideas, values and way of thinking, well, those things would not be allowed in a commie state for both genders.",0

I lost my brother to suicide when younger so I get the feeling. (a few cousins also)

I've dealt with some of my mates being on the edge, again, it was out of my control.

All I've learnt to do is listen and try let them get every thought out of their head. (only if you got a strong mind at the time)

These psychotic episode phases happen to a lot of men and in my experience they can last up to \~5 years. (after which most dudes become placid enough)

So given that he could be like this for a long time, you will need to learn to live with it and continue on your own path.

As for your own individual coping, some mates might give you good consolation but most probably won't.

Thing is, during that time, that month, i had a gut feeling something wasn't connecting... So big lesson is, your gut feeling is almost never wrong.

 One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. 

Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation, she chocked . 

I wasted, college fucking and my time , but that is alright. I cry not. Things are looking good for me past school, i have had offers coming in, now i am just picking the one's with high value.

every law should be made very carefully and loopholes must be fixed quickly.

being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in

from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure
hearted. so, taapsee use that tool intentionally. that is her strategy or plan
to get role from them.  
  
  
  
honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments

belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia

2539,2540,">1)In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals

I agree. There's one other category I would add to this, the ""feel good"" posts that are generally written in a poetic, metaphoric style without conveying any useful information besides the ""you should feel awesome and great"" vibe that so many generic, often liberal, self-help writers tended to write after PUA got into mainstream and they had to sell their stuff with sleazy tactics like appealing to the emotions and storytelling - instead of letting the work defend itself. Few recent examples I could name is The next generation, Demonstrating unique value, Animus possesion, The case against PUA and Dich cold approach posts.


>2)They want the male who has what others don't 

That's not true at all. They want the male who other women want. For example women don't want the one eyed midget with hunchback, they want the rockstar which other women want. Being unique is NOT equivalent to being an alpha. 

>3) and can thus disrupt the status quo

No woman wants a man who disrupts status quo. As demonstrated by 3,5 billion women living today, they all want the rockstar, the famous actor, the famous athlete and so on - regardless of the woman's culture or economic background the same principles apply. Disrupting the status quo is not enough, you also need to become ""famous for disrupting status quo"". Otherwise the ""status quo disruptor"" without the ""famous"" part is just a party pooper no woman wants to associate herself with b/c he lowers her status. 
 

>4) Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation

> you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males

That's not true at all. Here you're advocating for not hitting the gym and not lifting b/c it imitates the strategy of an athletic men that are successful with women thanks to being athletic. 


Imitating what other men did is not the endgame, it's a tool. You look at what the best sprinters in the world did before you, you analyse their training patterns, their workouts, diet etc and then you create your own, tailored to your own needs. 


If you want to learn how to write complicated intellectual posts you read complicated intellectual books. By reading enough of them and by understanding how and why authors wrote what they wrote you begin to develop your own understanding and by writing you develop your own style. Neither the understanding nor the style would be possible without the authors before you b/c you looked at what they wrote, adopted what you liked and added your own unique style to it. 

IOW, do get creative but don't waste time reinventing the wheel.


>5) When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance?


Never if you don't have to. If you want to proactively AMOG some other dude it's only b/c he has higher social value than you and you want to take him down or the dude is threat to you (meaning he's there to steal your girls). There is absolutely no need to AMOG if you're the alpha of the set, if you're the most attractive or the most desired. 

AMOGing for the sake of AMOGing (getting verbally or physically aggressive toward everyone all the time) is not attractive b/c it demonstrates lack of social intelligence and communicates you're an antisocial sperg. AMOGisn should be a tool not your personality.



>6) No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs.

Steve Jobs was the boss of the people who called him an asshole. IOW he paid them to do what he told them to do, however he told them is irrelevant b/c he's the boss and he's paying. The situation is different if you're not the boss, for example you are looking to get some capital from a venture or angel. Try being an asshole to VC and see how it works out. 

If you have the power you can behave like an asshole and be famous for it, be forgiven for it sometimes even liked for it. If you don't have the power, you're just an asshole.


> 7)A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident.

Nobody on TRP belives in that. This was true in 2005-ish PUA days and got corrected on TRP a long time ago.

>8) Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition.

This is not true. An alpha BECOMES an alpha when he ""defeats"" his competition. By definition her orbiters (men she's won't fuck) are not your competition, the other men she's fucking are. Since she already knows they are beta, you're not competing with them you're mentally masturbating about how cool you are and how the orbiters are not. This is pointless behaviour reminiscent of incels hating on guys who fuck.

If you want to meat your real competition do this (joke/no joke): next time a plate sends you ""i wanna fuck"" text, respond with ""dont have time"". Then stalk her and see who she's fucking besides you. 9/10 is some scrub badboy/bordeline junkie who is just chill as fuck and has good vibe women enjoy. And that's b/c while working on your looks is important part of the sexual strategy, it's not the only one that matters.

She systematically identifies and disproves myths such as the greater male variability hypothesis and the idea that women and men are psychologically different.

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

&#x200B;

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

You've had a fundamental shift in your thinking, which is perfectly healthy at 20. That being said, he is under no obligation to go along with it and probably won't. You might need to start considering if this is actually the right relationship for you.

Aside from that, husband benefits is an interesting topic. We usually only talk about wife benefits. I would say the following are singular to a husband:

For better or for worse: This pandemic has been really rough on me, on the heels of some other life altering stress. I've not handled it well. Vetting is over, though. We're married and my husband takes that seriously and has been my rock through my stress and tears and paranoia. I have been a *chore* of a wife at times, this year. I would never expect a boyfriend to put up with that.

For richer or for poorer: As your husband, his money is likely yours. Before marriage, anything he buys for you is a gift. Don't forget it and *never* ask for financial help. I actually have a rather long anecdote about my husband thinking I was about to ask for money when we were dating, when it was the furthest thing from my mind. It would have seriously dampened the relationship and he would have refused.

In sickness and in health: It's perfectly acceptable for him to bring you soup when you're sick or hang out with you and watch movie, but he isn't obligated to care for your physical well-being like he would were you married. When I nearly cut off my thumb last year, my husband took off work, rescheduled his call shift, picked me up as my emergency contact, drove me across the city to get stitched up under worker's comp, and stopped to get Chinese food on the way home for me. That is pretty above and beyond and while it would be nice of a boyfriend to do it, I'm not sure it's fair to expect it. The same goes for running out to get medicine or cleaning out the trashcan after you've thrown up.

The mundane: Sharing household chores and responsibilities and daily routines really muddies the water and it's why I caution cohabitation. My husband is in this for life, so cleaning my hair out if the drain is part of that, as are all the other gross parts of living with humans and the pets we share. I would never expect a boyfriend to take responsibility for trimming the dogs' nails, putting up the Christmas lights, chopping up the Christmas tree for firewood, or getting our oil changed. Those are husband tasks, as are the many little chores we've decided to split between ourselves.",0

This led to many Western fans in particular criticizing the series for its casual misogyny, though the sentiment was significantly less felt in Japan. Regardless, though this plot point is played for laughs, many felt that the confines of a fantasy isekai might not be the best place to handle such a serious topic.

I agree with these claims several time, and it's very likely that there is an ""empathy"" gap where women get support or understanding and men don't.

For example :  [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5xt2c/my_girlfriend_wont_let_me_finish_in_her_mouth/) is about a guy whose GF won't give him a blowjob (or won't let him finish in her mouth, the post is unclear) and almost everybody just tell him to deal with it and stop wanting it. While at the same time  [another posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g5vcda/nsfw_my_boyfriend_absolutely_will_not_go_down_on/) about a girl whose BF won't go down on her get responses telling her to dump the dude.

I've also seen two AITA posts about a parent wanting nothing to do with their born child because they didn't want it when the pregnancy happened but the pregnancy was carried anyway:

You guessed it, the woman had tons of NTA saying she's not forced to get involved in the child's life. And the man got almost unanimously YTA saying that if he has sex he should be ready to be a father.(I wanted to put the posts but unfortunately one of them have been deleted and the second post's link was in the comments of the first)

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The problem is not ""them being whores"". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT.


The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

Lifes too short to call women whores. Lifes too short to even care. Your attitude should be ""fuck it"" and you will be surprised where you end up - it will probably be somewhere close to what you originally wanted.",1

* Any of the above, but general disgust with current sexual dynamics searching for a way out

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The problem is not ""them being whores"". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT.


The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

Lifes too short to call women whores. Lifes too short to even care. Your attitude should be ""fuck it"" and you will be surprised where you end up - it will probably be somewhere close to what you originally wanted.",1

Everything has been such a blur family and friend and people from the community who my husband and father impacted. My father trained the rabbi who gave his service. My husbands students carried his coffin. Ive gotten so many letters and phone calls just sharing what my father and husband did for the people of our community. I never realized what sort of pillars in the community they were . 

My father was a rabbi for 40 years so the number of weddings, funeral, bris, mitzvahs is probably uncountable. The time he spent counseling is immeasurable. Theres probably no way to measure my fathers impact. 

My husband ran a book store and taught at the Yeshiva and was super active in the community. My husband was always there when someone needed him and gave deeply and frequently. 

Thats what I want my children to know their father and grandfather as. Caring and giving people who made the world better.

Im slowly getting used to a new normal without my husband. My whole routine is shifted without him. Im trying to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. Ive been trying to keep for crying in front of them. But I keep breaking down. Im not strong and this hard and terrifying and painful. I dont see another side to this.",0

Prove me wrong...",0
6090,6091,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

channel, leave alone penning down a comment. I personally abhor this
propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times.
It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital
platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get
certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and
Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that
the news channels alone can provide.",0

But yea most western women today have a myriad of mental health issues stemming from our contemporary experience. The amount of women going for a PhD I come in contact with who really are just doing it for the clout will astound you. Most women want a career because they've been told to want one.

I am at odds. I realised that I have been treating my boyfriend like my husband - what should I do about this?

 We've been together for 2 years (the first year was on and off and this year has been stable). Yesterday night we were talking on the phone and I joked saying I like the nick name Bubby because its hubby and baby mixed into one. We have been discussing marriage alot since being in Quarantine so I guess I felt comfortable making that joke. Then he said laughing that it was too soon and I shouldn't call him that. That shut me down - it made me realise I have been giving myself to someone as if he were my husband when he doesn't see himself that way or me like his wife. He is a good guy. He is loving and I would like to marry him some day. He said that however and I pretty much hung up and now I have this innate unease when I think about him. 

I know it is not his fault but I think I am more annoyed with myself for getting carried away - I am 20 and he is my first boyfriend so I can see why I fell into this pit of fantasy. When he said that it burst my bubble... I've lost my sexual attraction to him - me and him aren't really tied in any way so why should I give myself? We have treated sex casually in the relationship but I have been moving towards Chastity for a while now so because we are distanced due to this quarantine I have been turning him down for sexting and so on. I dont like sex being so casual anymore? But I was okay with it before? I cant help but see him as a user - even though that's not what is going on... I dont want to see him or have him touch me rn? I know I am being over dramatic. 

So...

What are husband benefits?

What are boyfriend benefits? 

Should I learn to compartmentalise the two? 

What are your experiences? 

How do I make it clear that wifey is something to be earned and that I am no longer going to be the way I was before?

One of my friends said it was kinda cringe that I had them on there because I wasn't a girl and it comes off as ""white knighty"". Which makes me feel weird about having them on there. I thought it was important to show solidarity with the feminist movement because I grew up with a sister and its been amazing to see how its affected her and the woman she's become because of it.

The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.

It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.

The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". 

Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. 

I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.

TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",1

3887,3888,"Is the happiness and fulfillment of bottom tier men dependent on the suffering and misery of women?Did I get that right?

So we have this ""sexless"" men problem. Of course these guess talk about sex but every-time we say get a prostitute they say the problem is love and intimacy . 

Something about sympathy because maslows hierarchy of needs aren't being met and a section of men are going to start offing themselves. 

But there's a reason these guys aren't getting a girlfriend. It's a free market hence very competitive. You are both the product and the sales man. These guys either have shitty products, are shit sales men or both.  Basically no woman wants to buy what they're selling. And some set their price too high (they only want hot chicks). 

And these failed sales men are very sad. They can't get girlfriends/wives. They'll stop working because they'll never have a family. Something something taxes. Then they'll shoot up a couple schools . Did I get that right? 

Once upon a time it wasn't a free market. Markets were very regulated and women couldn't choose who they wanted to marry. Being young wild and free was shamed. And pre-birthcontrol that lifestyle would have been much harder. 

Women married men they didn't feel anything for. They had sex with and raised kids for these men. They lived quite lives of servitude and were more or less miserable. Not all women . Just the women who had to marry the bottom tier men. 

After the sexual revolution women no longer had to date and marry bottom tier men. Online dating was the  dating markets version of globalization hence ""Chad( The Chinese)  is stealing our women( manufacturing jobs)"". So anyway these men stopped getting sex and we're back to current 2020. 

It seems there's no middle ground. Either the bottom tier men get wives and are happy and productive  while their wives are miserable.  Or the women date who they want and are free to be single while bottom tier men suffer from loneliness. 

Personally I wouldn't want my daughter being forced to date someone so he won't commit suicide or shoot up a school.

5310,5311,"Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, such as sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.

The meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.",0

In the past week alone, I went to make a purchase with my LTR. Because she didn't want to meet up one-on-one with a random guy from the internet. Know what happened? After she bought shit from him, he spammed her phone with messages asking if I was her BF, if she was interested, if she wanted to add him on social media, blah, blah, blah. And I was there and she said maybe two words to this man. I handled the transaction. And that was one of two times THIS WEEK something like that happened.

You're looking at this wrong. If you're with an attractive girl, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. Get used to it or start dating uggos. Stop fearing the competition--be above it. If you're with a hot girl, you should ALREADY be above most of the competition. It shouldn't matter. Treat yourself like you're #1.

>One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. 

Gentlemen.... understand this.  A woman who is cheating will lie and deny better than any man who gets accused of lying.  The tears come on.  The ""how can you not trust me"" lines come out.  They will act offended, upset, hurt, etc., that you could accuse them of something so horrible.  And the kicker... they say this with HIS cum still on her breath.  I lived this shit.  It's amazing how far women will carry the betrayal.  Lies.  Trickle truths.  Gaslighting.  Manipulation.

>Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation...

I had to do that once.  When she was in the ""nothing happened"" stage, she showed me edited screenshots, where she deleted PARTS of the conversation.  The conversation made it look like it was all him.  Years later, I found the REAL screenshots in her email. She saved the full conversation for herself before editing the conversation for me to see.  Cheaters will deny everything until faced with facts IN WRITING or IN VIDEO or IN PICTURES.  

>I am quite happy with this breakup, because man, i have been wanting out, i just needed a legitimate reason for leaving now i finally caught the bitch.

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved.

But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

3443,3444,"Why it's not ""morally"" wrong or hypocritical to sleep with many women yet expect the mother of your kids to not have slept with many menFirst things first, the red pill is amoral, so of course if you don't struggle with this issue then ignore this post. For people like myself who need to have an ethical explanation for what they do, here's why it is fair/not a double standard.

Men and women live different lives and are born with unique gifts and potentials, some overlapping, some not. Despite knowing this and capitalizing on their feminine power, many women (and their clueless simp supporters) will still try to shame men for being very choosy with their wives/common law partners/ mother of their children. 

A man building himself to his ideal man, creating an expanding frame and acquiring intellectual and physical resources will arouse and attract women as he gains momentum. Women may be ""attracted"" to the outward results of his success, but we all know they are ""aroused"" by his upward energy, his alphaness, his mission. Any woman who seduces him on that journey upward is temporarily stopping him. She has grabbed his attention temporarily, and when he busts a nut, he is satisfied where he is. Weak men stay here but an alpha man hops back on the horse and keeps moving upward. He has only been temporarily stopped.

When this man has spent many many years building himself, he may decide he is ready for a kid. This means he is very satisfied with where he is such that he is willing to now sacrifice mental physical and emotional energy into the next generation. He is literally sacrificing himself, his upward progress and his current wealth for this woman and child. This woman is getting a lot from this man- loyalty, tons of investment, and he is giving up a lot of other women who would love to be part of his now really established frame.

All he is asking back from this woman, is that she be worth giving all that up for. What makes her worth giving that up for? Certainty, or as close to it as he can come, that she will stay loyal to his frame. If she has a history of promiscuity, this means she is very willing to jump from frame to frame, giving herself to men in quick succession. Why would I commit to a woman for 18+ years if she can't stick to one frame? For a promiscuous man, the reverse isn't true. The difference is that for men to have sex, they dont need to enter a womans frame. They havent submitted to her and her reality, but the reverse happens for women. He was always simply building and expanding his frame, allowing women to enter temporarily. She on the other hand has been jumping from frame to frame.

So you see, as a man ascends and sleeps with many women along the way, enjoying them and potentially looking out for a LTR material (if hes at the phase), he is not doing damage to his ability to be loyal and invest heavily in a woman and child. This is because he has never submitted to any one woman's frame, he only built his own. The same cannot be said for a promiscuous woman.",1
5220,5221,"Original TRP post by u/taracus on this story:

http://archive.is/lv4aW

>Summary: OP (girlfriend) gets asked by an ""ancient ex"" to meet up in Amsterdam for a week while he is there for work (he lives in Italy and she in the UK). She books the ticket before mentioning anything to her BF because:
they were on sale for a ridiculously low price on the dates that he would be there, so I jumped at the opportunity.

>Boyfriend breaks up with her without loosing frame and even 'that' subreddit calls her out for being wrong.

>Body: So they've dated for 6 months and she thinks that going alone to Amsterdam to meet up with an ""ex from ancient history who is more like a best-friend"" is a good idea. She starts with the excuses even in the title.

>Her boyfriend shows exactly how a situation like this are to be handled, no harsh words, no complaining about not going simply holding frame:

>Pete seemed cool with it at first but after a few days asked me if there was any history between us. I was honest and told him there was. He didn't seem too bothered and eventually asked if I thought visiting an ex in another country was appropriate whilst in a relationship. I explained to him how Dave and my relationship wasn't like that and that we were strictly platonic. He didn't seem to really react, he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic, I suppose, would be the best way to describe it.

>Edit: ""he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic"" -> ""dont need to talk, just grin"" (c) Endorsed TRP-philosophy.

>First he calmly suspects that this is more than platonic and asks her and her hamster believes that going a week to Amsterdam with an ex to do drugs and partying is a sign of a ""platonic friendship"" and feels safe confessing that he is actually an ex. He then proceeds to ask if she think its appropriate (not telling her its not, just vetting to see if she is really LTR material).
She then pulls out the ""strong independent black woman"" card as a response:

>I then told him that I wouldn't be controlled and hated men that thought they owned me and could tell me what to do. I told him I was free to see who I wanted and that I found his lack of trust in me upsetting, disrespectful and, perhaps, a sign of future abusiveness. I now realise that this may have been a bad thing to say. Again, he didn't really react so I thought that was the end of it.

>Here most men would have caved, given her reasons not go, told her not to go or even worse, supported the idea of the trip because nobody wants to be an ""abusive boyfriend"". Her boyfriend on the other hand shows exactly how to hold frame he even explains it to her:

>Then, last night, he came around to my flat and broke up with me! I asked him why and tried to get him to explain himself and he told me that my going away was to see ""another man"" a deal-breaker, that he'd been in this type of situation before and wasn't going to go through it again. I asked him if this was an ultimatum - I hate ultimatums, they are tools of abusers - and he said ""No, its not an ultimatum. I've decided to break up with you. I have not presented you with any options. I just came to say goodbye."" Before I could say or do anything more, he kissed me on the forehead, said goodbye and walked away. He didn't seem angry, just...sad.

>No harsh words, no ultimatums, no anger, just HELD FRAME. He realise a women that cant show her relationship the respect it deserves dont deserve him and he simply lets her go.
Here comes some bonus:

>To make matters worse, I told Dave about what happened and he replied ""Oh well, guess that means we can have even more fun then! ;o)"" He didn't care about my relationship and my pain - he just wanted a hookup buddy and someone to get stoned with whilst he was in Amsterdam.
Suprise, her ex-boyfriend didnt invite her to Amsterdam to party to have a platonic friendship re-kindle. 

>Obviously both men in this story knew exactly what was up but she comes to the Internet asking for advice of what went wrong.

>I tried calling Pete today, about an hour ago, and he actually answered! He told me that I should look to be with someone who wasn't so abusive. He said, ""Please stop calling me - this is over. Have a nice trip to Amsterdam"" Then he BLOCKED me! How could he do that to someone he loves? Is he over reacting or was I? What should I do now? Was I wrong?

>""How could he do that to someone he loves?"" she asks herself without any self-reflection (until even the Internet told her that yes, you were wrong).

>Lessons learnt:
>Women believe in their hamsters, they are not lying when they say they ""didnt cheat"" or ""it just happened"", just because she believes her own lies dont mean you have to.
Hold frame, even if your girlfriend is planning on going on a fuck-trip to Amsterdam with an EX.

so the millions starving due to poverty due to the existence of capitalism and socioeconomic class everywhere in the world is okay, but communism causes starving is bad?

look you are romanian, surely you know what happened to post-soviet states after the ussr fell - how crime, poverty and hunger exploded over night? capitalism causes far more deaths than it helps. also, the only reason europe has a good lifestyle under capitalism is it exploits poorer countries for their resources.

also, under both soviet and chinese communism, their goal was to eliminate starvation and give everyone access to food

right and capitalism doesn't start wars over oil or resources for the benefit of a few? I'm sure syria and libya would beg to disagree

how is raising someone as an example for people to follow bad? This is literally what happened throughout all of human history through figures like odysseus/or skaldic bards.

so giving everyone equal opportunity to succeed is somehow bad? isn't this precisely what europe is doing now anyway?

>creating a rich elite that is devoted to the party only

capitalism creates a rich elite devoted to money only, that allows them to justify traitorous immigration laws, avoidance of tax, unbeneficial laws, etc.

all of the opposition in western countries is controlled, because any opposition that threatens the status quo is either shut down through concepts like 'hate speech' or the powers that be do everything to discredit it. how is that any different from what the communists do?

>collectivisation

and why exactly is collectivization bad? collectivization protects the individual from harmful influences, gives him a goal to live towards and protects him from the consumerist nihilism present in the modern world. in fact, collectivization would solve many western problems from the opioid epidemic, to obesity, to feminism to male suicide.

collectivization is holding people to a standard necessary for survival/prosperity. if you oppose it, you oppose standards, which means you want to stay mediocre making you essentially bluepill

No most democracies are not based on the roman republic model. the roman republic model is actualy close to the chinese ruling system, where a small cadre of men (the senate or in china's case the politburo) make decisions and then execute them.

western nations are a twisted form of athenian democracy.

And yes, germany was an economic miracle under AH

>Ok, I see why you bought women into discussion, you made a point. Well, communism exists in countries like Cuba, China, N Koreea, Vietnam, not sure about Venez and all of them are crap holes, except China that is doing better because they liberalised their economy.

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.  Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue.

^2  Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever).  Dont over plan.  

^3  Mild condescension is ok.  Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.  Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid.  Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.",1

4706,4707,"""Childish"" to women is a man doing too many things that don't directly benefit a woman.  If he isn't serving a woman or piling up resources a woman can land on when she's bucked off the cc, he's being childish.  Peter Pan.  It's especially objectionable to them if he's doing it with other guys, thereby preventing them from doing something that serves women.

When a man is doing something he detests that serves the interests of a woman (and her children), that's when he's being least childish in their eyes.  That's when he's a good man.  That's when he's a 'real man'.  Self-sacrifice in order to give her what she wants but doesn't need and shouldn't accept.

4979,4980,"Fwbs - Unsure if she's pulling back...confused on what to do?I'm unsure if she's consciously pulling back, she's lost interest, or she's just comfortable....but something has changed. 

I've been seeing my female colleague Fwbs for the last 6/7 months. She initiated the whole thing and we called each other our 'distractions'. 

Sex started out as once a week, which gradually increased overtime. In Feb, she told me we may have to stop as she's starting to feel attached. I think this was to gage my reaction and interest level.  Up until then, I held my emotions close to my chest and always let her bring up the flirtiness and 'emotions' first - she would often message saying she would like a cuddle or whatever and then apologise for ""needines"" saying as ""there's no place for it"".  I always reciprocated to the same level and energy. 

Then in March, I started to compliment her more and tell her how much she turned me on etc. At the start she told me she was very needy and insecure - and believe it or not, but these compliments and reassurances did wonders for our 'relationship' - we were having sex nearly everyday. We ended up staying a night in a hotel through work - the day after, she was telling me how much she liked it and that it made her feel like she wanted more. She then wrote me a long message about how attracted she was physically/sexually and started it off by saying ""some things are best left unsaid"" - I asked her but she refused to tell me. At this point, it was her doing most of the chasing - I was just sitting back and letting things happen. 

Then lockdown happened. We have a bit of freedom so can see each other occasionally. For the first few weeks, she would come over a couple times a week, however, I would always have to ask her (I've always done it, I think she feels too vulnerable in making plans for sex) as she would never invite herself round. She was still being flirty by message, saying she wished she had more time etc. to come round. 

Then, 3 weeks ago, I asked her round and she said she couldnt but ""would honestly love to see me. Maybe tomorrow?"". I said ""yes, providing you can get here by xx as my roommate will be in"". She replied ""I will see. You can always meet me for one of your walks on the weekend"". I said ""my roommate normally comes with me so we'll have to see"". She then had a slight outburst and said ""you told me you normally walk alone, good to know I won't have to go out my way"". I replied ""he does on the weekend but not in the week"". Anyway, she said that was ""nice we do that"" and then messaging continued in a normal chit chatty vibe.  I will admit, I did tell her I walked alone everynight a few days before and I only said my roommate comes with me on the weekend to lash out in response to her saying no - she's always so flakey and I felt like she asked me about 'going for a walk' as I didn't reciprocate her saying ""she would love to see me"".  

From that point however, she has taken a lot of emotion and flirtiness out of her messages. We've met 3 times since, once for sex and I can still feel her physical attraction is strong. But her messages have been quite dry. I will also say that she does continue to message me first everyday (always, always messages me first) until we say goodnight, but it's mainly chit chat and about work stuff. She seems to deflect any flirtiness and doesn't initiate any emotions anymore. 

I like her a lot and want more but it's difficult as we work in a very small team, and neither of us wants to be rejected. 

I just find it odd that up until the whole walking conversation, she told me a few days prior that she was missing me, and that seeing me once a week wasn't nearly enough. Then a few days after the convo, we met up and she said to me ""little every so often is nice though, at least it's something"". I mean, seriously? 

Another interesting point, is that nearly a week prior to the walking convo, we had sex and she messaged afterwards. It seemed like she was 'teeing' me up to be emotional towards her first but I didn't. Nothing obvious but my gut told me by her messages that what she was doing. And when I didn't, it's like she tried to play it cool after. 

I want to ask her if she's okay but it's been a while and I wanted to see if she would come around and be more open but she hasn't. I also don't want to ask her as it will make her feel vulnerable and she will likely deny it anyway. I'm also cautious that perhaps I've overpursued her and she's losing interest and backing off slowly. 

Is it best to just play it cool, give her space and let her come to me more, or just tell her ""I think I upset you?"". I wonder if she's slowing things down to keep her emotions in check - perhaps she realised we were getting carried away? I just don't want to blow it by coming across as needy and seeking validation when there's nothing concrete to present back to her...",0

It wastes further time for you and you can creep others. So not good. Well I haven't been there but If she has rejected him 2 times it doesn't sound like she been comfortable. If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to.

My brother got into a massive argument with my parents accusing them of never giving a shit him and never listening to him about his mental health. 

Hes a real stubborn type, never will listen to anything new, left wing, blue pill kinda guy, in college, never had a job or a girlfriend. Sits inside all day and beats off and plays video games. 

I come downstairs because of all the yelling, and see him banging his head against the wall just screaming telling my parents to leave him the fuck alone, my dad trying to grab him to stop him from banging his head, while my mom tells my dad to just let him run his course, and that if he truly wants to kill himself we wouldnt be able to stop him 

He storms out, steals my bike, so I try to go follow him, but cant catch up. I get my parents to call the cops, so they can find him before he tries anything. They find him over the edge of a bridge, and get him down. Hes in the hospital right now. 

I was never close with him, or any of my family. What do I do moving forward? Hes so stubborn, so if he doesnt end up killing himself, idk how Ill get him to turn his life around, which I think is the root of his problems. 

Hes very convicted, and I think because of his depression and low serotonin, he reacts to any attempt to help him change with extreme hostility.

going on with that scene as it was a man who has said no. but the actions of
an alcoholic and drug addict as shown in the movie who doesn't seems to be in
his full senses and is invited by a woman for sex when shows a little
frustration (he doesn't even touches her after her denial and eventually
leaves) would be arguable ...

My boobs grew like two cups sizes and I *hate* them. None of my light, flowy blouses fit. None of my bras. I've got a handful of shirts I'm surviving in and like three bras that actually fit...

What's worse, is most of my clothes thst do fit don't fit them right. I'm top heavy. And I can't wear any tight or supportive bras while I'm breastfeeding. And I actually breastfeed via exclusive pumping, so being able to access both to put on a pumping bra is a necessity.

And my husband finally has some time to help me with my intense nine month old and all the stores I would normally go to are closed. We are students, so I don't have a ton of money to spend. Amazon is a favorite.

So, all that being said, any words of wisdom or links to pumping friendly giant boob clothing? I'm finding that alot of cute, fitted dresses would fit my bust but be loose everywhere else. It's hard enough being a mom to an intense, high needs nine month old with medical issues, adding in that none of my clothes fit right and she needs to be outside everyday, it's all taking such a big toll!

More important is the disconnect between value and appearance, which you talk about. When we realize that dressing well communicates that we give a fuck, are worth it, and have the self-awareness to do all this - well, then we don't want to be seen in our shitty sweatpants, even when we're just home with our families. (instead, I upgraded to tapered track-style cotton pants, with a fitted t-shirt in a solid color for 'pajamas').

3591,3592,"Thanky you for your reponse. Yes I reject the idea of toxic mascullinity. What you are describing I would attribute to Gynocentrism and also male disposability/ the gender empathy gap as the videos show. See the video below for toxic feminitiy - and YES it does lead to death and violence. I dont think toxic femininity should be gendered. Funnily enough, the few feminist who have agreed that toxic feminity exists again do not call it this, they blame it on the patriacrhy and at times call it internalised mysogony. If feminism continues to use such deregatory and bigoted terms such as toxic msaculinity, mansplaining, manterupting, etc then Karen, toxic feminity etc will inevitably also result, and we dont want either of these, yet currently we have it one way. Id rather not see the rise of the term femsplaining and FEMIslplaining (where feminists explain to men their lived experiences)

Thank you for your support of the issue. As I said though, there is clear violent opposition to it by (some) feminsists and also society at large, also, as I gave clear examples of

The is it 2 because some take men is irrelvant. It is still vastly different whether 2 vs 2000 or not

(some, but sadly mainstream and the ones that actually matter) feminists, sadly are not ahead as you state, they have precisely created those gendered laws and issues in the first place:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkhq13TVRGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkhq13TVRGc)

This is why it is very good that western feminists are not tackling issues in India or Saudia etc. (they wont anyway as it wil cause more probems for them, apart from say it is bad, but that is another debate) Anyway:

""There  are many ways that sexism harms women in india, there are also many  ways that the same sexism benifits women. There are also many ways in  which sexism specifically harms men, and in many ways that that same  sexism benifits them. To fix the issues in places like india, we need an  egilatrian approach, or we dont need a name for it just a global  approach that solves issues of both genders and not one way.... For  example in Saudia Arabia, it is not fair to allow women the right to  work but still keep the rule that womens personal income is solely for  her, and that a man is legally obliged to provide for her as well as the  social pressure to do so also. Also women cannot not keep the rule  where their money is solely theirs and not their husbands, and then  still expect larger inheritances. That kind of change is what (most)  feminists would do if they got involved (western ones wont anyway apart  from to talk about it), as they would only focus on womens issues such  as right to work, yet ignore obligation to be guaranteed finanicially  looked after. I am not speculating, similar things happened right from  1st wave feminism (and \[some\] feminists did this on purpose e.g. took  property that they acquired the legal right to but the MEN still had the  responsiblity of the tax for, and some men went to jail for not being  able to afford their wifes property, which they would still keep and  would not sell)""",0

2947,2948,"Actually this movie is different because..in other Bollywood romantic movies
hero fights with 100 villains for heroine..or heroine's father is the villain
who hires a gang who will beat hero and then hero will fight and prove his
love...kabir singh is at least different in this case...and Kabir singh is
rude and short tempered..that's his fault and director portrayed the impact in
movie..and the suffering is also portrayed..this movie does not influence boys
to do whatever Kabir singh does...if anybody gets inspired..then he will be
also inspired to kill people by only playing PUBG
And one more thing it is at least better than those shitty Bollywood movies in
which hero fights villains without any weapons(like he is superman).at least
something is different from the previous Bollywood romantic movie trend..
please support that.and you are talking about the behaviour of a real human
being is not portrayed? Who stays confused in his life? I think you have not
seen the movie till the last minute..Kabir Singh who was rude from the first
he also cries at a time when everything was going out of his hand..so it shows

from the movie.

6176,6177,"movies are either engaging or they are not. that’s what makes them work or
not. as for toxic masculinity - 1. shahid has made a very bad choice & suffers
endlessly till he gives up in the extreme end & makes a change.
transformational characters have a way of connecting with audiences, come what
may. 2. let’s look at patriarchy narrative - all love stories true or untrue
have that. there’s also reverse discrimination against men in society at times
- biggest example all supposed criminals guilty of crime yet to be proved are
published with photos n names if you are a male. go look for traffic challans
- less than 5% number is female - ain’t that surprising ? all power to women -
watch bhavani bhavai, mirch masala, rudaali n many more. 3. let’s look at
patriarchy & other stupid evils as in movies - all karva chauth scenes ever,
lavish weddings n songs, success at any cost, all super fit heroes & heroines,
the list is endless. these are subliminal & vicious more damaging than
anything. 4. flawed characters are just that - characters in a story arc. we
have flawed protagonists in darr, baazigar, anjaam, devdas, dev d, raging
bull, taxi driver, wolf of wall street, a clockwork orange, so many more. it’s
just a movie. 5. do haunted houses shown means we never buy them or that
ghosts exist ? there’s free will & free choice. 6. what’s bigger cheating -
saying that you are catering to family & make movies like race3, thugs of
hindustan, zero, kalank, tubelight & cheat audience of non engaging bullshit.
or dada kondke, mithun movies which know their audience - engaged or
entertained them, though not to everyone’ s taste. but they were not cheating
their audience. 7. an actor becomes a muslim to marry 2nd time, so many actors
have extramarital affairs, so many actresses break homes & marry a married
person. nepotism, corruption is always ok when it’s personal but not in public
domain. should we be boycotting all these to set an example ? 8. i felt
disappointed when laila majnu, sonchidiya flopped & bodyguard, raja hindustani
etc. made money. in terms of technicalities & acting skills kabir singh is
good, trying a narrative which is engaging at times & cringy at others. this
will work overall for sure. why look for political correctness all the time ?

kind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist
who's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey
rather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his
perspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right,
wronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the
same basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the
movie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That
it's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny.  
  
  
Throughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost
feeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by
his self-inflicted agony. Vijay/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this
torment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues
till the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any
kind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn
by finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't
find anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way
glorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and
repulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his
lifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as
a person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering
misogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message
instead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You
literally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting
characters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while
trying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact
a very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed
man, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch-
black. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a
positive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the
rock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at
his lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered
a personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the
choice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for
eternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus
the film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of
its runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life.  
  
For all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said
earlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and
technical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience.  
  
  
I wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with
an open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially
since this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to
distort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when
they are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like
Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society.

I'm a guy in my early twenties, I'm going to university, and I've been trying to change recently, so I also started reading up on feminism. Now, I've always been generally left-wing, but when I read a feminist critique for example, I sometimes become quite dismissive. What I mean but that is that I think things like:

""That's ridiculous/not true""

""Oh, so that's a problem too?""

""Seems like everything is an issue""

But when I think about the points, I was so eager to dismiss, some more, I'm more open to them and usually understand where they're coming from. However, that first impulse is really weird. It's sort of like I'm realising that I've been benefitting from some of the problems women face in society, simply because of how society is set up, and my brain doesn't want to admit that because it's easier for me to ignore everything and act like I've done nothing wrong and that everything is fine and dandy?

Also are you withholding sex because you feel like it will give you more power or an upper hand the the relationship?

###Social

I deleted the dating apps, too much temptation for quick validation when I'm bored at work.

I have built a schedule for my time.

I'll be spending 3 dates a week discovering and working on my covert contracts, maintaining boundaries, Game, Kino, initiation, OI, passing shit and comfort tests from 3+ ""different"" women who all know I'm seeing other women, and developing and maintaining the beginnings of my Frame. 

###Mental

I couldn't figure out a way to make the leap to internal abundance (non-external based) when it comes to my value to women while sitting in my house being in my own head.

Plating was absolutely about seeking external validation at the start and still is to a certain extent, ""proof of concept"" for myself, and I made an extremely risky move that I'm still fighting my way through internally... I could become addicted to the external validation (I'm still working to understand, minimize, and regulate my *desire to be desired* vs having the proper mental model of ""assumed desire"" - *of course they desire me - because I have high value as a Red Pilled man who owns his shit - this one is lucky I'm deciding to gift her with my time and attention*, it is extremely easy to be on the wrong side of that line, or lie to yourself about which side of it you're on) 

I won't blame anyone but myself if shit hits the fan because of my choices. 

I've made some progress already, but not the full on critical leaps that are necessary to never need this kind of external proof again. 

I had the internal realization that women's value of me isn't a worthy measurement of my value, not even this small part of my value, nor is it an accurate one. This is why it is so important to be my own judge in all things.

My mental state has quickly arrived at the fact that plating women can't be a mission, not even a side mission, its basically a distraction at best - a ""hobby of interest"" to pass time enjoyably and help one relax after a day spent living a fulfilling life. 

Women (single women especially) are all desperate to connect to a man who doesn't enervate them, and offers escape from their shitty, lonely existence. AWALT. J10 and u/HornsOfApathy put it well, and as I've been going on dates with these women over the last month while mostly Larping Alfa, the truth of that is crystal clear. The better I embodied that energizing HVM who could offer ""The Great Escape"", the better my dates went. Having an attitude and outlook absolutely overflowing with positivity and life energy (""Abundance"") was extremely attractive to them, whether in a high or low energy environment. 

I'm not that guy yet, but I'm not exactly Larping him either. He's in me, got buried alive for a while, and I just have to keep helping him grow to become an automatic part of who I am. 

J10 talked about a hot tub soak. One of my plates has a nice deep tub in her room connected to a standing shower (hers is the master in the house), so after we fucked this last time, I spontaneously had the desire to try it out. As a reward for her, I let her join me for the bubble hot soak. I had her sitting in my lap in the tub, both of us laid back, just relaxing and talking and joking about nothing important. She commented that she ""didn't think it would be this nice"" just to take a bath together. The time I spent at her place was less than 3 hours total, yet that *escape* was there, and was tied to having great sex with me. She was asking before I left if I could stay over, and when she could see me again. The next time she started the bath herself and asked me in.

This is like a different kind of dynamite, and I need to treat it with the same care.

I hadn't reread HOA's and J10's words prior to reflecting on this week in at least 4 months, and everything I've been doing with this chick and the other 2 has been almost 100% on instinct, very little thinking, so something somewhere must be clicking... the experiences I've had reminded me of their words. Good to reread them and remember what I'm working towards as a starting point for an eventual LTR if one of them vets properly, although not likely.

Fuck me... just reread the other parts of HOA's ""Great Escape"" and a staple of what I've been telling my plates from the very beginning is that I don't judge them, I only judge myself.

""No Judgement, No Expectations."" 

This is basically my catchphrase at this point whenever they tell me some shit they're nervous about sharing because its personal or they give me the cues that they're scared I'm going to ""run away"" because they have faults or whatever. Teaching them that their shit doesn't bother me or affect why I'm spending time with them, I'll just listen and thats it. 

I better go reread the Fundamentals of Frame posts because these plates are about to do a trust-fall straight through my ""Frame"" and its not going to be pretty if I'm not prepared to hold them in my Frame and they end up hitting the ground. I need to not be a cardboard cutout basically. Its well past time to be a man in more than words.",0

To capitalize on your innate gift all you have to do is find a talent that fulfills a great need. Whether you know it or not all businesses and inventions heal or fix a need. The bigger the need you service the wealthier you will be as a man.  Usually if you know of someone close to you who had a pain or a problem this will motivate your dreams. If you are currently working in a dead-end job it is because you are lending your talents to ensure your employers dreams are more successful than yours.

In this situation, we have identified a victim of years long abuse, one where the perp has manipulated society at large and even spoke at the women's march. And now that the truth has come to light, feminism and the media are silent. And it's because it provides evidence of the fallacy of feminism and is an example of all the criticisms of the MRM/Anti Fem movement. And that can't be abided.

3289,3290,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

4836,4837,"How I succeeded in datingAfter reading a lot of hoopla on inner game, flirting and other BS that there is out there, I came to an undeniable conclusion that most of these were full of shit. Sure, you could learn something of value from there, but most of it BS. So, I started using my common sense and got success.

I started working out. Not just because I wanted to date hot girls, but because I wanted to improve my health. This after having a fatal hospitalisation due to liver swelling. I improved my diet, which was now balanced and vegetarian. I did eat boiled eggs for breakfast though. And, I started working out. Hired a trainer and started finally. There were many points in time where I simply wanted to run away from gym and sleep in my cozy bed. It was painful, but worth it in the end. Now, for a year I have not been sick. Not even a cold.

Secondly, I started visiting a good barber. I can't emphasise how important is having a good hair cut. After getting my haircut, I kept going to the same since it is important to go to the same barber for maintaining a good hairstyle. I have specs so I bought a stylish pair of eyewear.

Thirdly, I improved my fashion sense. I started taking my female friends for shopping my clothes. If you want to attract females, better ask them what suits you. Besides, they have a much better fashion sense than males.

Meanwhile, while executing all this, I started socialising. Like just going out there. Started chatting up any girls that I liked. Initially, I had nerves. I was frantic, nervous. But gradually I started gaining confidence. I read somewhere that when girls reject you, think of it as their loss instead of yours. Initially, I will be honest, I got depressed upon rejection. It shattered my confidence, but I kept at it. I had to. And eventually, this benefited me. I became desensitised to rejection. Whenever I got rejected, I got a bit sad but moved on. 

Then after some time, I finally got success. Hence my confidence increased. But a big part of it was me getting fit. I cannot emphasise the importance of what being fit did to my confidence. No longer had a pot belly. No longer was I skinny. So I would say this, going to gym and being fit will boost your confidence enormously. You do not need to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Just be fit. Muscular. Don't go overboard with it, lol.

Another thing that has kept me happy in the relationships is:-

* I do not dip my pen in crazy ink.
* No games. No push pull. Be genuinely busy. Develop constructive hobbies. Develop interests. Be an interesting person for the sake of living fullfiling life. Not to get chicks.
* Never pursued a girl that was playing games. I have my self respect intact. No girl is worth losing it. I have a rule about dating. If after first date, the girl does not herself ask for another date or start a conversation, I consider it to be the end of it. Never drive single handedly. After some time if a girl is not reciprocating, or is confused. I tell them to make up their mind.
* Be forth coming once you start dating about what you want. No pussyfooting about what you want. Do not be friends if you are attracted. You will end up suffering.
* Do not be manipulative. Do not put a nice guy act. Girls can see through it within seconds. They might end up using you and then dumping you before you get anything.
* Do not stalk. Do not be pathetic. No means no. Develop a thick skin and learn to move on.

Have had it happen a couple times where shes more eager to be in my life and shes always revolving things around my career/career ambitions.

Just cause everyone is asking. Im in the field of law still finishing up my studying though. I like the comments so far. But Ill throw in a more specific example of when this has happened. Ill mention the career field and they suddenly ask what car I drive, type of house I want etc. Another thing is like when Im confident or vague they start saying like yah I can tell why youre in the field. What annoys me is that they are extra inclined to be in my life and suddenly everything I do is cause of my career lol. Its not a bad I guess. But its just off putting cause its just my career. Im really not the type to care about what field anyone is in cause Im not very judgmental. There is a plus side I guess.

6290,6291,"Red Pill Rage makes you look petty.**Introduction**

I recently had a young man send me a text saying how he is mad at the world, how women are a waste of time, F this F that. He lost his cool. As someone who is older than him and as someone he looks up to, I feel like I am personally responsible for not handling this. So I sat him down for a talk, to explain what he is going through. Red Pill Rage.

**Body**

This is a phase that many men go through after realizing how this world operates. We were once blue pilled simps who were shown the light (or found it/were driven to it). We are now in recovery mode to become who we were biologically born to be. This is a life long process, its slow, but if you are consistent, it will be steady up and up. It's the school of life. You will study, pass, and fail. Its normal.

Someone going through red pill rage will exhibit symptoms including but not limited to:

* Anger and disdain for women
* Anger and disdain for the people who raised him
* Depression and lack of motivation to proceed in the world
* Confusion as to what to do next.

The sidebar covers pretty much all the fundamentals that we must go out and practice through execution, but it is not a play by play. It is not a step by step instruction manual on what to do, and this is what frustrates people going through rage even more. And the younger and less based the person is, the worse and chaotic his rage will be. Let me explain why.

The blue pilled betas can actually teach us something. Their life's goal is to succeed in this world. Have a ""stable"" career, have ""retirement"" savings, have a ""normal"" family, raise ""normal"" kids, etc. They want that blue pilled life dream, even if they have to work their ass off for it. They are WILLING (even if brainwashed) into giving up their lives to build this ""stable"" world around them. Sure there are always exceptions to this rule, but at least the more traditional men, will be chasing a stable career in medicine or engineering or something. This makes them at least well based in their own life. Even if they go through a divorce and realize how blue pilled they are, red pill rage will last a shorter amount of time for them, because they already have a financial and educational foundation. They have a resume, they just have to start their social/sexual life over, which, thanks to the sidebar, is as simple as going out into the real world and fucking up repeatedly until you get the hang of it (not really but you get the gist).

A young man in his late teens or early college years who finds the red pill, and realizes why his young sexual life is absolute garbage, will have severe rage. This is because he has no existing foundation. He hasn't had a marriage/relationship that is long enough to give him some experience. He doesn't have the finances to be able to just move to a new city and start over. He doesn't have a ""successful"" resume. He goes into full panic mode, and eventually, just gives up. He knows he needs to get his shit together, but on top of his obligations to get his financial and practical life together, he is now bombarded with information on how to fix his still not fully developed sexual life.

Again, there are plenty of exceptions to the rules. I have seen young men who found the red pill and immediately saw the mountain they must climb and proceeded to hatch multiple plans on how to do so. Others...fell into depression cursing the world they live in and becoming more reliant on spoon fed step by step instructions on how to proceed. This dependence on a play by play must be broken.

So here I will leave some recommendations as to what to do if you find yourself in this situation. This is not a step by step instruction booklet. These are tips that will explain what you are feeling, why, and where to go.

1. You are mad at women for being the way they are. Okay, and? Screw them. Focus on yourself and your individual happiness and satisfaction (in moderation) as well as making sure you have a solid foundation financially and educationally.
2. ""Everything we do is just to get laid, what is the point?!"" This is where you need to change your mindset. Getting laid is a PERK of having a solid foundation as a MAN. Be a man first, slay pussy later. You need to understand that you do not revolve around women, they revolve around you. You must become a magnet, not be attracted to one. A magnet has scientific properties that make it attract all sorts of metals. IRL this is: Money, fame, good looks, reputation, success, status, masculine alpha behavior/mentality, an IDGAF mentality for sure. Magnets do not fucking care what you are, if you're within range, you will be attracted.
3. You feel like you know more than the men around you so now you are acting petty and posting on your instagram story about how ""women suck and man up and etc"". Stop. Just stop. You are just like everyone else, we are just like you. We are all in the same boat, you are not special, and just because you know something someone else doesn't, doesn't mean you are better. Also, stop putting red pill stuff you read online on your instabooks, you will alienate anyone who sees it. Just get off social media period, stop texting women and being their little bitch, go to #1 on this list, go make your base. No not a pillow fort. A base, somewhere you live, somewhere you can go to when shit hits the fan and start over. 

**Conclusion**

Remember at least one thing from all of this: This is not an over night change. This will take years. Just like the gym wont turn you into the rock over night, reading trp content and practicing it wont make you an alpha over night. I know I am far from where I want to be, but I want to try, and I will try. So go cool off from the rage, accept the world as it is, and learn to use it to your advantage.",1

The method of purposefully making someone sad doesnt benefit the person thats being hurt, it only benefits the one doing the hurting and thats selfish


It may not mean to hurt the person, but purposefully making someone else sad does hurt them and it taints their entire day

You can still be a loving and supportive partner while being unavailable, you dont need to be cold or hurtful or closed off emotionally, and I dont agree that consistently showing someone you care about them is babying them, I think its the foundation to a secure and healthy relationship.

Compare that to the games journalists who can't give us ONE NAME and who are on social media continually acting in exactly the ways an anti-conservative clique would in fact act.    If there wasn't a single black super hero in Hollywood and famous actors and directors were on Twitter constantly talking about how much they hate black people, then maybe you'd have a successful analogy.

Thank you for all of the support. I didnt think Id get it. Ive posted on reddit so much for therapeutic reasons and met with a lot of hostility. I decided to just grow up and realise I was being an IDIOT. Ive had female friends, Ive got with girls in the past, I dont deserve this idiocy and neither do women or those around me. I am gonna change, but not to get laid or anything. Actually, I suspected that I wouldnt ever get laid and I literally didnt care - because I wanna love women not hate them, have a healthy mindset to benefit my happiness and those around me. However it turns out Im actually fairly cute - so fixing my mindset and being happy, I might actually attract a girl, if I am lucky. But if it dont: its okay. Im not entitled to anything and if I was never to meet another woman again in my life, I still dont want this hate and sadness in my heart. Thanks for all the replies and the many who private messaged me, which all of them were women bar one - which is just a great show of how kinda women can be and how diverse and different they are. 

Ive got friends, I was working out and continue to do so, I have hobbies but I wanna develop more, try out any sport I can once I get to college, go to college to better myself, all the while working on myself. I feel as if the past year of depression and suicidal thoughts are coming to an end - I have hope again. Thanks everyone",0

A question I was wondering about, and I hope this doesnt come across as rude: does any of it have to do with weight? I had a friend with very large breasts who was considering a reduction, but was also on the heavy side. She lost 3 cup sizes when she lost about 10kg, and looks so much better in proportion now. Because she also did a lot of strength training during her weight loss journey, she no longer has any back or shoulder pain.

emotional people. When a kid in his teens sees one of these so called
""romantic bollywood films"", it is bound to play with his mind.  
  
In this scenario, i certainly won't blame the directors or producers, because
I'm sure they may have great scripts, but the audience in India is such that
they dont want to see that. They don't support it, they dont like it. They
want to see that typical ""mirchi masala"" movie and they dont want to think
beyond that. In such a situation, the cinema industry has no option but to
comply with them.  
  
I think its high time we open up our narrow thinking. I saw Joker yesterday,
and oh boy was that a masterpiece. I find it hard to believe that we dont have
such brilliant ideas, but bringing it to the big screens is the biggest
problem. I can do nothing but hope that one day, bollywood moves on and gives
a chance to better projects. Kudos!",0

You went there and basically said Try to convince me and thats not really how you get people to want to invest their time in you. Also, as was said before, you didnt adhere to the rules. So dont be too surprised.

Also, why did you ask on that sub specifically? If you search for feminism in the searchbar, youll see more moderate and open subs before r/gendercritical (one of the first ones is r/askfeminists ffs, another, r/feminisms is also centered around debate, although not the kind you were looking for, but they wouldve probably taken your question a bit nicer anyway). Those have different policies on asking questions.

And lastly, again: Why *that* sub? Why are you asking the radical part of a group to define the group for you? And lets not even get into the fact that this group is (to say it nicely) disliked by many other feminists for excluding trans people (thats who these feminists mean with the term terf). So asking *them* specifically for a definition just seems like you went out of your way to ask the group that least wants to talk to you.",0

Then she said his age was 25, while she was just 13. Unanimously, every single guy in her immediately vicinity started screaming for her to ""not even think about it"" and that he ""did not want to meet up with her"". They all knew he was a pervert from the beginning, because they all are aware guys are all disgusting freaks. This is something men won't ever admit to, but they know is true - the only thing they care about is taking advantage of others. 

The fact that every single guy came out against her meeting up with this man shows just how much they have a coordinated language that only they, the fucking psychopaths, understand. 
It's not that they DIDN'T care about this girl, but instead knew what the outcome would be before it happened. They absolutely grasp just how repulsive men are, but can't admit it because they would have to call out each other - which they NEVER would do.",0

5963,5964,"Something that helped me gain confidence.So, I know a lot of guys(including me) lacked confidence. I lacked confidence almost my entire life, I was not awkward but I still felt like I needed more confidence. One thing that helped me gain A LOT of confidence is this:
One night I was extremely bored and thought I might download Tinder, so I did that and I upgraded to gold version. I changed my locations often to many different countries, I also downloaded some apps where you can talk to strangers online. I downloaded an app where you connect with snapchat and you can match with girls and talk to snapchat.
How did this help me?
Well I got some matches and started chatting with some girls from Poland, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, anyway the countries doesnt matter. I felt an immediate ego boost, to see that women from all around the world would want to talk to me. What matters is this, you are attractive, some girls will find you attractive, some wont. What you need to remember is that you are attractive! Anyways when I did this I noticed that I was talking to 10 or more girls that I probably wont ever meet in real life. I wasnt worried that I might say something wrong to drive them away from me, because they are so far away from me that I wont see them in real life. I just had fun and had interesting conversations. The thing is when I started talking to girls with whom I could actually meet up with I wasnt asking myself questions like Did I text her early, did I text her late, did I say something wrong? I just went with the flow and talked to them, I KNEW that I was attractive, I knew that women wanted to have conversations with me. What I got from my experience is that some women will like you and some wont and guess what, thats fine!! If you keep doing this, talking to girls from all around the world, I promise you will improve your confidence and conversation skills!

So to summarize: download many online chatting and dating apps, meet women from all around the world, talk to them, you will see that when you talk to women from far away and when you talk to those women that you can actually meet up that there isnt a difference, you will gain confidence, you will improve your conversation skills, you will improve your text game!

Anyways just wanted to share what helped me, if you want to know which apps I used just PM me and I will tell you! Remember guys, you are attractive!!",0

410,411,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

I *wish* that my *only* problem with ugliness was the lack of success with women. I found many copes like vidya, movies, and dog to cope with loneliness. It's painful to be alone but it's possible to go on. 

But bullying absolutely destroys my mentality and will to live. It happens almost weekly. I've developed social anxiety, and depression. I cannot go outside feeling safe. I have missed all my lectures in the past 3 months and when I did go outside, I was met with more bullying. I cannot do my favorite sport, I can't even go shopping because I will be met with smirks and looks of disgust. This is the life of ugly man. 

*Who are the bullies?* It's mostly women - educated medical students that will soon become doctors. *What do they say?* Mostly ""eew"", ""hell no"", ""he is ugly""....

For instance, last Wednesday we had an exam. I was standing in line with earphones when I hear an ""eew"" and then 4 girls in front turned around and looked at my face with spite. How am I supposed to be confident? How can I become a doctor when I cannot look in people's eyes from bullying? FML.

5540,5541,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.

3657,3658,"Can't say I'm too surprised as it seems the same sort of phenomena seem in the past with academics on parental leave following the birth of a child, but also not sure about what to do with this.  Any thoughts?

As with many things, I'd expect a lot of proposed plans to be likely to fail to address the full range of incentives they might otherwise create.  e.g. if men are assumed not to be spending time while on leave or in quarantine doing the work of parents but rather doing research, any policy intended to address this issue would seem likely to strengthen incentives for men not to parent.

As the moment there's also a narrative of women's research contributions tending to be ignored, whereas in this case it seems to more openly acknowledge that the research simply isn't getting done due to competing time commitments for things like parenting.  I have a feeling that that will soon be forgotten again.

One trend that I'm also wondering about is household cleanliness and how quarantine might impact that.  Are people actually keeping their homes significantly more clean than in the past due to concerns over the pandemic, or might some levels of cleanliness be relaxed due to not having to worry about entertaining guests during this time?  (Am thinking here of women doing disproportionate housework, but perhaps also due in part to arguments that I've heard that women are held to higher standards for this - but perhaps from visitors rather than from their partners).",0

In monogamous societies there is less room for different marital behaviors between sexes because nobody can have more than one spouse.

I think the thing that comes closest to ""hypergamy"" is human societies with polygamy, where a woman may prefer to be a wealthy man's fourth wife over a poor man's first wife. Or in premarital sex culture, where a woman on tinder may prefer to be a player's hundredth lay than a virgin's first lay. Those are the main places where obvious gender asymmetries show up.",1

>North Dakota state Rep. Ruth Buffalo (D), for instance, [told](https://archive.li/o/0RdcR/https://www.twincities.com/2020/04/15/land-olakes-makes-over-packaging-does-away-with-indian-maiden-logo/) the Pioneer Press in St. Paul, Minn., that the Land OLakes image of Mia went hand-in-hand with human and sex trafficking of our women and girls  by depicting Native women as sex objects. Others similarly welcomed the companys removal of the butter maiden as long overdue.  
>  
>How did Mia go from being a demur Native American woman on a lakeshore to a sex object tied to the trafficking of native women?

 While the author, by his own admission, ""participated in protests against mascots and logos using American Indian images in the early 1990s, including outside the Metrodome in Minneapolis when Washingtons team played the Buffalo Bills in the 1992 Super Bowl"" he realized just how hypocritical the censorship being pushed is.

>Mias vanishing has prompted a social media meme: They Got Rid of The Indian and Kept the Land. That isnt too far from the truth. Mia, the stereotype that wasnt, leaves behind a landscape voided of identity and history. For those of us who are American Indian, its a history that is all too familiar.",0
3003,3004,"In everything in game, besides holding frame, even in which in rare times it must be broken for comfort reasons, you must utilize it as push pull. Eye contact is to create tension, to project energy, mindset, focus. In pick up we use what we call laser eye contact. 

1. Forehead relaxed

2. Eyes low like someone shined a light in it, or you just woke up

3. Barely able to tell that your eyes are open, but enough  to know you definitely are alive

4. Focused on a singular point. A point within that point. Like staring at the eye of a needle. Then trying to find the middle of the eye of that needle. That's what makes it laser

5. You project what you're thinking in your mind through your eyes. If you feel it genuinely, your eyes will assume it

5a. Relaxed, yet loose and solid. Like how you lightly pull a rubberband apart and when you snap it it returns to position. It didn't have to do anything to do that. It simply was.

Strong eye contact implies many things. Dominance. Confidence. Ability to be present in the moment and be relaxed. Lack of fear. But it can also project the desire to be violent. A predator never takes its eyes off its prey. You however know she is not prey. 

You hold eye contact just long enough to communicate the right things, then break it. Like you break for natural pauses in conversation. Push pull. Good feelings, then take it away. The tension comes from them wondering and wanting the good feelings back. 

There isn't a magic formula for when to pull back. You have to feel your way into it and be empathetic.",0

At first I questioned that Daniels doesn't say anything or ""yes,"" as he knows prez isn't racist, but it actually makes sense Daniels doesn't give a statement there. (He also hates the guy asking him, as he's generally a dick, and Daniels has also talked to prez informally and can see the guy isn't smart with his words, and needs a lawyer)

Lifetime:

* Four in ten men (41% or 3.7 million) and three in ten women (31% or 2.9 million) experienced physical violence.

Past 12 months:

* For men the proportion experiencing physical violence was 5.4% in 2016. 

* For women, the proportion was 3.5% in 2016.

In all cases it was more common for the assailant to be male.

Please note that this is physical assault only and does not take into account stalking, sexual assault etc. where the disparity goes the other way. 

For boys it is unclear, but the same survey found that around one in six women (16% or 1.5 million) and just over one in ten men (11% or 991,600) experienced abuse before the age of 15.

4319,4320,"TRP was meant for Average Frustrated Chumps not Bottom Tier Omegas**Who is the Average Frustrated Chump?**

The average frustrated chump aka our beloved beta has had a semi normal childhood. They know how to talk to people and make friends. They have a friend group that goes outs and meets girls. The average frustrated chumps has gotten girlfriends in the past and knows how to flirt(albeit badly). 

Our AFC is a 5.

The purpose of TRP was to teach 5's how to improve their looks to a 7.5 and how to act like a player.       
 It also teaches men to take women off the pedestal. 

Go to the gym, fix your wardrobe , get an awesome haircut.

 Stop trying to be friends first.  Assume attraction. Kill approach anxiety. 

2-3 years of consistent effort and you can go from a 5 to 7. It works for guys with a decent starting point.

Another important note is that a 5 will see results faster. A wardrobe and hair cut can bring a 5 to 6. His friends will compliment his newbie gains. This postive feedback will motivate him to continue his journey.

**However TRP was never meant for Bottom Tier Omegas**

Omegas are guys who have no social life , no experience with women, are downright unattractive in multiple ways, and  are considers creeps by literally everyone who interacts with them. 


Our Omega is a 2. TRP welcomes all men with open arms and will try to help them. 

In theory TRP could work for them, but there no advice for guys who are starting from zero. 

How do you teach someone how socialize and flirt through a Reddit post? It's almost impossible.  


2-3 years of consistent effort and these guys will go from a 2 to 5. All that work to get mediocre women our AFC was running from . 

And these guys will see no fast results. Girls don't care if the obese guy has swag. Your newbie gains can't compensate for your social anxiety  . They get no positive feedback until they reach the minimum of 5. 


Any new trick or theory they learn from TRP can only be tested years after they see it. The AFC can test it out when he goes out or even on his GF/wife. Maybe an Omega can try it out some girl he's orbited but that's about it. It'll be months of improving himself and learning the basics before he can test TRP.

Even on the topic orbiting the advice should differ. If the Omega has literally one girl in his life, maybe he shouldn't ""next"" her. That's the only socializing with a girl he has. He should practice what hes learnt on her. Our normal beta can find another girl hence he can ""next"" her. 

You'd have to make an entirely new sub for guys who need to get from 2-5.  Then they can graduate to TRP.

**Here I explain the rise of the Blackpill**

The balding, 5'3,  Indian ~~janitor~~ programmer has found TRP. They've always been on Reddit. Reddit was built for these guys.  

This guy will be never be Chad. But TRP will give him hope. And he will be disappointed.  

The OG RP dude bros just didn't quite understand what they were dealing with when they tried to save Redditors . ECs would  tell them to talk to girls and these guys would ask how. ""What do you mean how? Just flirt like you usually do"". Poor asktrp ECs probably never realized they were talking to Omegas. 

Eventually the manlets, autists and  indians/asians realized that even if they did everything TRP said they wouldn't get the results of someone with a better starting point. 

Hence The BlackPill was born - Genetic Determinism the ideology. Some guys simply have lower ceilings.

Some guys will never reach 7.5 and get to date stacies and plate beckies.  Some guys peak at 5. 

""All that work just to be average? lol "" These bottom tier guys all denounced TRP and made their own subs. However one thing they  took from TRP was pushing women off pedestal. They did that perfectly.

This what ultimately lead to the death of TRP.  All the AFCs came improved and left, leaving the dregs of Reddit. The ECs struggled with the omegas who believed they had potential; who eventually graduated. And the omegas who felt they'd never make it  denounced The RedPill and took The BlackPill",1

not. as for toxic masculinity - 1. shahid has made a very bad choice & suffers
endlessly till he gives up in the extreme end & makes a change.
transformational characters have a way of connecting with audiences, come what
may. 2. let’s look at patriarchy narrative - all love stories true or untrue
have that. there’s also reverse discrimination against men in society at times
- biggest example all supposed criminals guilty of crime yet to be proved are
published with photos n names if you are a male. go look for traffic challans
- less than 5% number is female - ain’t that surprising ? all power to women -
watch bhavani bhavai, mirch masala, rudaali n many more. 3. let’s look at
patriarchy & other stupid evils as in movies - all karva chauth scenes ever,
lavish weddings n songs, success at any cost, all super fit heroes & heroines,
the list is endless. these are subliminal & vicious more damaging than
anything. 4. flawed characters are just that - characters in a story arc. we
have flawed protagonists in darr, baazigar, anjaam, devdas, dev d, raging
bull, taxi driver, wolf of wall street, a clockwork orange, so many more. it’s
just a movie. 5. do haunted houses shown means we never buy them or that
ghosts exist ? there’s free will & free choice. 6. what’s bigger cheating -
saying that you are catering to family & make movies like race3, thugs of
hindustan, zero, kalank, tubelight & cheat audience of non engaging bullshit.
or dada kondke, mithun movies which know their audience - engaged or
entertained them, though not to everyone’ s taste. but they were not cheating
their audience. 7. an actor becomes a muslim to marry 2nd time, so many actors
have extramarital affairs, so many actresses break homes & marry a married
person. nepotism, corruption is always okay when it’s personal but not in
public domain. should we be boycotting all these to set an example ? 8. i felt
disappointed when laila majnu, sonchidiya flopped & bodyguard, raja hindustani
etc. made money. in terms of technicalities & acting skills kabir singh is
good, trying a narrative which is engaging at times & cringy at others. this
will work overall for sure. why look for political correctness all the time ?

Despite this, it continues to find a fanbase, as evidenced by its consistently high ranking on sites like Crunchyroll. **Here's a look at how one of today's worst anime has become one of its most popular.**

So the arguments seems to literally be ""I disagree with some of the supposed messages of this anime, so obviously it being popular makes no sense"".

>The controversial elements might actually be a boon for the show's popularity. Some viewers may seek out Shield Hero because of its taboo, almost risque reputation, while others might even sympathize with the protagonist. **This would justify the show's label as an ""incel fantasy,""** but it would also explain why **rampant criticism has failed to break the show's viewership.**

Weird how someone who might empathize with a character being wrongly maligned and mistreated by powerful social elements might not react positively to criticism revolving around how it's apparently *morally wrong* to ever portray a woman abusing societal expectations for personal gain.

There's a few limp-wrist complaints about generic anime tropes thrown in, but its pretty easy to tell the driving reason this dude hates Rising of the Shield Hero is because it was declared guilty of wrongthink for having an evil female character do something an evil female character would do, but those damn incel anime fans kept enjoying it anyway.",0

3281,3282,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

>These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly.

I used the wrong word for draconian. I didn't mean harsh per se...I meant one sided. What I meant was we're just going to say, all these programs are just going to be help women. Full stop. They do not apply to men. Just put all the cards on the table. 

The problem is that's not politically viable, I think. It just breaks a basic sense of fairness that I do think is dominant still. As well...I think it just makes the costs too evident. It's not some vague goal...it becomes...yeah...your son has to sacrifice to get the numbers right. Sorry, he has to give up on his dreams. I'm sure you'll make him understand that it's for the greater good. 

I think that's why it's not sustainable. That's the other side of the pendulum.

4106,4107,"The Power Of Teasing - Building Major Sexual Desire In WomenWomen are not use to men rejecting or teasing them.  The hotter she is, the less likely a man has teased or rejected her.  As a matter of fact, if he has, this is the guy she finds the most intriguing.

""Why are you playing games with women""

This is a game that women play with men all the time.  When a man does it back to her, it disarms her.

I wrote a post called  [**How To Be Charismatic With Confidence Coming Out Of Your Pores**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/how-to-be-charismatic-with-confidence-coming-out-of-your-pores/) and it's with the elements I mention in that post and what I'm about to share with you is gonna give you an unfair advantage over your male competition when it comes to women.

So how do you tease a woman?  First and foremost, stop being thirsty to fuck.  Second, this is not teasing that goes nowhere.  The more you tease her, the more intrigued she becomes and the more she will keep you out of the friend zone.

Don't give a woman everything she wants.  When you give her everything she wants, she will start to get bored.  Keep your conversations short.  When the both of you hang out, she will enjoy your time so much more.  So if you only hang out with her for just 10-15 minutes at a time, the more she starts having feelings for you, the longer she's gonna want to spend time with you.

Her: ""What?  You have to leave?  You just got here!"" in a whiny voice.

You: ""Yeah.  I gotta go.  I have to leave for work tomorrow""

Her: ""Wanna spend the night?  I can wash what you're  wearing so you can have something clean for work tomorrow""

This is an example, don't expect this to happen exactly like this.  But you get the idea.  When a woman starts making accommodations for you to spend more time with her, she is doing what men want women to do when they ask her on a date.

Remember that women make time and switch things around for men they're attracted to.  The more desire you build up in her, the less resistance she'll have.  If she's suppose to hang out with her girls, she'll do it earlier or later to make time for you.

If you learn how to focus on building the desire in her, you won't have to worry about sleeping with her... she'll do her best to make sure that it's gonna happen.",1

In the last weeks, you have probably stumbled upon some articles titled something like SELF-QUARANTINE : YOUR SURVIVAL GUIDE or HOW TO SURVIVE SELF-QUARANTINE and articles like these just elicit fear and anxiety among its readers. So Ive decided to take another approach, to change your perspective and encourage you to actually enjoy the remaining days of your self-quarantine.

First and to ease your mind, allow me to point out that once you look beyond the fear and anxiety, you will understand that there is an expiration date. You dont know when, but you know there is one. That alone will give you the strength to endure. This is the power of impermanence.

I know as youre going through it, it might not seem that way as theres a natural human inclination to think that whatever is going on is the way its always going to be. Obviously, thats not the case. This will be over again. It might be a few weeks, it might be a few months but it is going to end.

Allow me also to point out that you currently have one incredible asset in your possession that most people usually dont have in their lives which is time.  
Time is maybe the one asset in life you cant replace and we spend it usually running around going paycheck to paycheck hustling and bustling We have a period now where we dont have a choice but to have some time. Were stuck at home and that is actually an incredible opportunity.

I am going to list a lot of action steps that I consider very important so you can choose the ones youre interested in and focus on them.

The idea is to get you doing those things and do as much relaxation or entertainment as you want. That will be your reward! Whats important is that you enjoy your reward.

Lets get right to it...

&#x200B;

#### Be kind

Take 15 minutes from your day to call your grandparents or anyone you know who is especially at risk of complications from the virus.  
Check in on elderly neighbors you know (while keeping your distance). If they need supplies and feel unsafe going to the store, offer to go for them; or just give them a call to see how they are doing. And if you order something to your house, like pizza, generously tip the delivery guy.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Physically)

This is not a health pandemic. So please please please stay healthy!  
Dont get fat, keep eating well : get your fruits and vegetables. Take Vitamin D by getting some sunlight.  
This is a great moment to establish healthy routines by changing our diet and incorporating better nutrients into it.

Its also a great time to catch up on your sleep and let your body figure out your own personal circadian rhythm.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Mentally)

You can safely go outside while avoiding close contact with other people and touching surfaces that may be infected, and sometimes, this is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Soaking up sunshine and breathing fresh air will help rejuvenate you and make you feel better.  
You can also practice your walking past a stranger awkward smile you know the one

Weve all tried time and time again to get into a meditation routine, but there always seems to be something (like life, yknow!) that gets in the way. Well, now that many of us are staying home during the day we have the perfect chance to follow through on making this a new habit.

Another habit you can practice is self-care. It is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind healthy and happy. And self-care is imperative to stress management.  
And yes, for the guys reading this, its okay to practice some form of self-care. Its not exclusive to girls.

&#x200B;

#### Stay fit

No gym? No problem! We are creatures of habit and as such we get used to our daily routines and rituals. This is a great time to try and challenge yourself in other ways.  
Try a new fitness app. Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do squats in your room whatever you have to do. The important thing is that you keep moving, get your blood pumping and sweat as much as you can. This will benefit your mind and body equally.

&#x200B;

#### Read and study

One of the most amazing resources we have as human beings is the fact that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We dont have to relearn everything from scratch we dont have to figure everything out, almost everything you want to learn has been written down somewhere, its been put into a course by somebody or into a very good self-improvement blog (wink wink) so take advantage of this time to read a good book or study a subject that youve been wanting to study.

&#x200B;

#### Stay connected

Remember the phone? A long time ago it was used for a lot more than just texting and Instagram. Pick it up and call a parent, friend, or co worker. FaceTime with your friends. Improve your relationship with your family.  
Its important to keep working on your social skills, dont get rusty in that area and dont go into this depressive isolated place. This is actually in some ways an opportunity to bridge new social connections or to deepen the social connections you already have.

&#x200B;

#### Start your passion project

Not everyone is lucky enough to call their career or job their passion, but everyone has a passion. Maybe you want to start a home bakery or maybe you want to start your entrepreneurial adventure, theres really no better time than when youre sitting around doing nothing to get that in place and get that started.

You dont have to complete whatever project you start in the amount of time we are on lockdown, but you can definitely get the ball rolling and really create some momentum that would allow you to finish it soon.

&#x200B;

#### Learn a new skill

The business world is rapidly changing and new skills are needed constantly, but it can be nearly impossible to learn something new while youre just trying to keep your head above water at work. So take that online coding class, practice your video editing skills, or start learning a foreign language now. Imagine the surprise on your co-workers faces when you return from this hiatus speaking German!

There are lots of ways to teach yourself, with blogs, apps and online courses at your fingertips. If you learn a useful skill while away from the office, you will return to what may be a difficult job market with a leg up on your competition.",0

2524,2525,"How To AMOG Beta MalesIt shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.

I had access to her mail, so i easily got into her Facebook... 

Checkin wassup, found, some hooking up in 2017(in college) with several guys that year. And it was said to be our best year together. 

Thing is, during that time, that month, i had a gut feeling something wasn't connecting... So big lesson is, your gut feeling is almost never wrong.

 One thing i admire about the bitch is, she would defend her innocence with her life. I never seen someone defend her herself so much like that. This has blindsided me a lot of times when i suspected something. 

Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation, she chocked . 

I wasted, college fucking and my time , but that is alright. I cry not. Things are looking good for me past school, i have had offers coming in, now i am just picking the one's with high value.

6395,6396,"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 12, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

For ex: A girl expects me to be in touch with her constantly. We can't be meeting all the time. She expects that we are in touch with each other constantly either through call or text. So, I'd say I'm busy or I'd say normally I don't text so much but rather I'd like to meet in person instead. Somehow, she ignores this and keeps texting me. Now if I do respond to her everytime she texts me, I'd be texting all day long and eventually I'll come across as low value. On the other hand if I don't reply or take a long time to reply, it'll come across as disinterest or arrogance and she may auto-reject or go find someone who can cater to her needs. If I like the girl, I'll be losing her either way. How do I balance this?

3182,3183,"Self improvement resources for being a better/warmer conversationalist and for regulating emotionsI couldnt find this specifically through the search functions. Anyone here has book recommendations or practical applications on how to improve conversation skills in RPW context (I feel like conversing as a businesswoman is very different) and on how to regulate emotions?

Struggling with these two aspects a lot - its the last two things on my list to work on for my current self improvement journey. 

For conversation, I struggle with putting on a social mask, so to speak. Social niceties and sounding open/warm drain me a lot, because my character tends to be more calm, straightforward and logical, even serious. When Im not mentally prepared to make small talk, sometimes I get nervous and dont know how to reply, unless there is a point to the conversation (eg. we are meeting to discuss X, for example) or it is a genuinely interesting discussion without the social niceties filter.

I worry sometimes that I may be good for stimulating discussions, but may not be warm/affirmative enough. How can I present myself as warm in a conversation, without having to act bubbly? (I do feel warm and open to listening, Im just not sure that Im coming off that way!). I also have a very low threshold for bullshit, and many times conversations seem to involve white lies, feigned interest, bullshitting, which make it tiring. Is this a perspective problem that I have or is this something everyone just does out of practice?

This area in life has confused me so much. I would rather I have a more natural strategy too because I dont think I can keep up an act for the rest of my life. My MBTI is INTJ because it may explain some things.

My goal = be a better *female* friend to my female friends (not just a *masculine* friend), and a soft place to land for my future partner



Also struggling with regulating my emotions, I tend to change moods very quickly and dwell on the past/future a lot, and although there are no major mental health concerns, I would like to feel more stable/in tune and in control of my emotions. Stronger. I cant go to therapy at the moment because I pumped my money into fitness/feminine goals. Can anyone recommend some books?

Any other self improvement suggestions for soft skills also very much welcome. Hope everyone is safe and healthy in this climate!",0

It seems like a lot of men in the millennial and gen z age range are really struggling with the sexual marketplace and finding a partner. Judging from my own observations and the discussion I read on the internet (not just on reddit, but across different social media platforms and forums). Women just consider them invisible. Large portions of them aren't having any sex at all, a lot less than previous generations, which means they won't get the chance to have kids unless that changes.

In contrast, it seems like the vast majority of gen x men and boomer men found life partners relatively easily. It seems extremely rare to find a 40+ year old man who hasn't been married, had kids nor had at least one long term partner (unless they are a Chad, but at least they are getting regular sex).

Men are told a lot on here that most men end up finding a partner and having kids, but do you think this will be true of millennial men and gen z men? What do you reckon?",0

3279,3280,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

My friend is married with two very young children. He is a textbook extrovert. He had an active bachelor life, never a problem getting women. He wasn't RP, he just did MANY RP things without realizing it. He has an almost magical ability to get people to follow him and subscribe to his ideas. He lies very easily and convincingly. He has the dark triad down pat. Since childhood, he has created a number of memes (Dawkins definition, not internet definition) within our friends group that stuck for months. On top of that, he rakes in a comfortable six-figure salary in the finance field.

But the curious thing about this man, who I consider a brother, is that he's never wanted to be a leader. The thought turns him off. And he has always gone for women he could be submissive with. ""Alpha in the streets, beta in the sheets,"" doesn't quite describe it. More like beta in the house as soon as he steps through the door.

His wife comes from money. Big family, not divorced. She is, for the purpose of this discussion, otherwise a typical woman. A little more neurotic than most, but typical nonetheless. She took a high turnover job that she was doing when they met. She stopped doing that job because it was ""stressful"" (and really it is, but c'mon, could you imagine quitting), and stayed home to take care of the kids. But her quitting predates the pregnancy.

____

Lat year my friend had a tragedy in his family, the kind that will weaken any man. Most women will allow you to be weak for 1, maybe 2 days. But in him this persisted. And eventually he displayed the **ultimate form of weakness**: he considered suicide. Even worse, he told her. 

So she did what women do and dragged him to a couples therapist where most of the time was spent with her berating and ""venting"" about him. And, he tells me, they would always come back from therapy seemingly worse than when they began. This is a stereotype that I think we've heard about  a lot. I was very disheartened to see it play out so clearly, so close to home. And I'm not even kidding, you could have scripted it. Really saddening stuff.

So of course she did what any woman does when she sees her man hit rock bottom for a prolonged period of time. She supported him throughout in a very nurturing way and built him back up. 

Ha. Come on. 

No, she kicked him out. He is now simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

___

So what I'm seeing is possession on both sides. She is the one making all the decisions and she has simply switched off to him. There is no getting through to her. She has somehow turned his thoughts of self harm against him and made it about her. You know what I'm talking about. When a girl gets to that point, becomes that brick wall. She becomes a stranger. It's a terrifying thing to go through if you've never seen it before. That's her animus possession.

And he, he is reduced to begging. He wants to ""fight"" for her. He is purely following his emotions. He is talking too much. He is a shadow of who he was, taking a one-two punch of his family tragedy early, and now this new tragedy. His anima is in charge.

___

Underlying this is a jarring reality: I have looked up to this man my whole life. I have mimicked and copied some of the things he does as an example, with some really good success. This is a guy who has made the right moves since day 1. While I was fucking around with my head in the clouds, making mistake after mistake, he always -almost naturally- knew the right thing to do.

Now I am worried about him. I am worried about losing my brother. And he has already been seeing therapists all year, both on his own and the couple. I think I might be the only one on his side, because I know that despite all his genius he has never been here before and doesn't know what to do. And that's why he is making the wrong moves. If I didn't now what I know, my reaction would also be to distance myself because no one likes a downer. But I know everyone else is doing that. 

After the shoe does drop, I'm going to try to guide him correctly. But I've only ever rescued myself from the anima before. It took months, almost a year. I just need him to not fucking kill himself.",1

3408,3409,"Look man Im not gonna lie to you, but I never thought I was gonna lose my virginity. I lost it at 21, kind of late compare to my peers. Honestly, I was pressured by friends to lose it. However, I held my ground and just told them if I lose it Ill lose it. What Im saying is dont put losing your virginity on a pedestal, when I first had sex it was awkward asf. When I first lost it, I was like was that it? So right now Im glad youre seeking help. What the others have said is take walk or start lifting. 

Im so glad I started lifting not only it help your health it also boosted your confidence. However, since all the gyms are closed right now Ill suggest just taking walks then start transitioning into running. Also, like another redditor had said to start worrying about your looks as well. Girls actually see that, if you cared about how you dress/groom yourself. It shows that how you actually present yourself as a person. I highly suggest going to therapy to get your mental health back on track as well.  At the end of the day, is the fact youre trying to better yourself. Since the gyms are closed, I hope you join one once this all blows over. I know you may feel intimidated at first, but honestly people dont care about what you look like or do. Since they are there to workout and move on with their day. Because at the end of the day youre there to better yourself. If they say something about you they can go fuck themselves. I met a lot of friends from the gym. 

Also, one last thing is during this time find a hobby and start branching and find people with similar interests. Then build a connection with them and you never know that you might find that someone and it blossom into something more. I suggest trying to find three hobbies that helps you be creative, money, and being healthy. I as would like to suggest a book to read as well. Its called The subtle of art of not giving a fuck by mark Manson. Truly a really good book on developing a better mindset. You got this I believe in you. This whole subreddit got your back.

I notice a lot of young women who call themselves ""alpha widowed"" tend to bring up later that they have mental health issues too.

Some reasons good men might not catch your eye...

-You might have ""intimacy fears"" that stop you from genuinely connecting with people in a healthy way. 

-You might have low self esteem issues that cause you to accept the love you think you deserve (unfulfilling) rather than the love you desire (fulfilling).

-You might have an ""attachment style"" that creates bad dynamics. 

-You grew up in an unhealthy environment and haven't resolved issues from childhood. Often we can confuse what feels familiar with what is attractive. Until you address your issues so that your body registers that familiarity as a red flag, this can make balanced and healthy people unappetizing. 

If any of this sounds familiar, therapy can be a huge help.

If none of this sounds relevant, perhaps your criteria are too stringent on things that don't matter and perhaps lax on ones that do. ""Marry Him"" by Lori Gotttlieb is a solid book if you're worried you're in this camp.",0

In any case, the previous commenter makes a good case for vetting. I think Athol Kay (former RP blogger for men) wrote that a man's goal when picking a wife should be having the happiest family life possible, not marrying into problems and trying to rescue a woman. I'd say this applies to women as well.

Obviously, vetting isn't perfect...people change, you may not really know what a person is really like until a crisis hits post-marriage (job loss, serious illness, pandemic, heh). But marrying without vetting is potentially setting yourself up for trouble and a lot of painful work... especially if you have kids!",0

3284,3285,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

4064,4065,"I Have Been Doing Cold Approach For 2 Years Now: This Is How I Went From Kissless Handholdless Virgin To 15 Lays In 1 Month&#x200B;

About 3 years ago, I was a 29 year old Asian guy with only a couple months to go before I turned 30, working at a Big 3 Accounting Firm, and I was realizing that I was unhappy and miserable, working long hours at all times of the day and night and spending all my free time playing Overwatch, and Dota 2

And despite earning good money, I had a house and some savings, I just knew my life was NOWHERE near where I wanted it to be or thought it SHOULD be, despite all the years of hard work because I was FOREVER ALONE. I was still a virgin at age 29. A kissless handholdless virgin I just wanted to take the time to finally get this off my chest since I have nothing better to do during the quarantine.

I soon decided, with the help of an epiphany while reading an article on RedPill titled HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD that this was not the life for me and that I would need to start approaching girls and learning game to have any hope of losing my virginity before 30

I didn't want to become a 100+ lay gigachad like the article outlined:

* I just wanted to experience what other guys experienced in college that I missed out on.
* I just wanted to have someone I could share my hopes and struggles with, someone I could come home to and hug if I had a bad day.
* I just wanted to have some fun before I get married and start a family

Was that really too much to ask?

So I quickly began to learn about game and seduction and browsed Reddit and other forums almost daily to get hyped up and learn how to do cold approach. I soon discovered, however, that I had bitten off far more than I could chew

I met up with a white guy I met online who seemed equally as motivated as me to go out and approach and we went out to several bars and clubs together. Every time we went out, he would always go home with a new girl, mostly Asian girls Im not proud of it, but I was extremely jealous since none of these girls gave me any kind of IOIs or other signs of attraction when I approached, and stopped going out with him. Now, I realize it's because he went to the gym a lot and always had a nice haircut, but back then, It was kind of ridiculous how Id approach girl after girl and get one word answers and a GO AWAY vibe the entire conversation and he would come in a few minutes later and THE SAME GIRL would be smiling and asking him questions about himself, it felt like he didnt even need to do any work to get laid

At this point, I was watching pickup videos from or reading articles on how to get girls on an almost daily basis, trying to study and learn all the latest game techniques. It felt like I hit a brick wall. This was SOOO much harder than I thought it would be. The HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article specifically said that women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one but that didnt seem to be the case. I was a 55 Asian guy competing with 60+ white guys at every club I went to and it felt like no matter what I said, no girls were even willing to have an actual conversation with me. This is after 100+ approaches so I knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort.

So reluctantly, after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality, I invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since I figured I was already watching so many of their videos, and its only fair that I pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing.

For those of you thinking about going to a PUA Bootcamp, be very careful you don't waste all your money like I did. This particular company did not give a single FUCK about me other than my money. My instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach, which I already knew how to do, and every time I asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive, he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off. I asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers, always giving some woo woo answer about how I needed to have outcome independence and have more fun. It was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance, even though they teach that looks don't matter.

I finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches. It was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and I just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts. At this point, I was so desperate that I tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date Over the next couple of years, I became obsessed with getting good with girls, which certainly kept me going, but it also caused some problems

I went out with so many wingmen, hoping to find that gold nugget, that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall, but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5'10"", no exceptions. I read an article on Reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot. Girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when I asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together. That's when it hit me that I didn't know as much as I thought I did and that there was a lot more to learn.

The bad news is, all this rejection was not good for my mental health. I started to wonder if maybe a short Asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate I was seriously considering moving to Thailand or The Philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife

But finally, I found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and I immersed myself in his training He was 57 and Asian, so a short Asian like me.

The first thing he told me was that my hairstyle, fashion, and body language were all shit and unless I fix them first, nothing else would work. Now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice I read like the HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article which convinced me that looks dont matter but I decided to give it a shot. I got a blazer and chinos from Zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch. I didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable IMMEDIATELY. Suddenly, they would hang in and listen to every word I had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave. One girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when I asked her to grab a drink with me! I was SOOO HAPPY, it felt like everything changed.

Next, he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt. This was really hard for me because I spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer, always hunched over. I even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after I started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients. Again, I noticed immediate results. I actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob! No lay thought because of last minute resistance

The one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety. I had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all. He had me watch episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white. This did not come easy but I worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable. This turned out to be the tipping point and I finally started getting laid regularly when I go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before. Overall, I'm very happy to have fucked 15 girls. I know that's not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it's a big improvement over ZERO.

Thats kind of the level Im at right now. The girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but Ive gotten a 7 before, mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing. The quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily, I already had a plate I was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan, so Im not wanting for sex, just spending my days reading and learning as much as I can about working out and nutrition since I got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up. Hope everyone reading this is safe and got some value from my post. Just needed to get this off my chest before work starts up again.",1

6186,6187,"homosexuality : is it natural ?[困]  
  
not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .  
  
the question that should be asked is,  
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?  
  
cause when god created this universe & everything in this universe to obey him
& his law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
the planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .  
  
i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. they all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.  
  
the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30
minutes ,the planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.  
  
man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.  
  
now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?  
  
it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of god & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, his whole life style will be a deviation.  
  
the bible clearly says ,he changed the ""truth"" of god into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of god & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in africa walking
around with broken wrists .  
  
since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.  
  
scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,we have seen that ""thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.  
  
so scripture says "" behold i the sovereign lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.  
  
there is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, god is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created.",1

Im suicidal because im a disgusting dirty and gross whore. Im only aroused sexually by beautiful men. No matter where I talk about this I get banned or silenced because its that pathetic and gross. My last post got removed by a moderator and I was told I didnt seem suicidal enough. Im a cutter and i one time have to have 100 stitches at the hospital in my left arm. For anyone who doesnt think im suicidal enough or serious i have razors i can take pictures of to prove that i am. You are welcome to message me about it.

For context here's a bit about why ive been getting banned:

I've been reading a lot on reddit about dating & attraction lately. A lot of men keep telling me that most women are able to be aroused by ugly men so long as those men say & do the right things. I am not this way though. I just like beauty. My question is: is this how most women are?

Ive been trying to talk about this on various subreddits and getting banned.

The first subreddit I tried talking about my love of beauty on was [r/cuckoldpsychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/cuckoldpsychology/) and got banned.

Then I tried posting about it on [r/purplepilldebate](https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/) and also got banned.

When asked why I was banned they cited a comment of mine where I'm talking about good looks being a key component to attraction. I got banned for it then muted when trying to talk about it with mods. Do mods hate female sexuality??? Here's my conversation with the mods, as well as the comment that I made: [https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f](https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f)

So that brings me to my question: **are most women like me and they get aroused by beauty?**

I always just considered this a part of my sexuality? Is it wrong or dirty?

# &

Do women hate other women for their sexuality? I ask because I got banned from [r/askwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/) for asking about my sexuality & *if it was normal for women to love beauty*. I was told that it was not an appropriate question. When I asked if it was appropriate to talk about sex I was muted.

I've been arguing for a while that if men and women really are more similar than different, that women are just as capable of violence and abusive behaviors as men, including rape.

I use this rhetoric a lot when talking to feminists specifically.

*""Why is this the only issue where you think men are different?""*

The problem ultimately comes down to them only ever caring about gender stereotypes when they negatively effect women, while at the same time amplifying negative stereotypes about men (I guess to make women look better?).

The result is that they end up perpetuating the same antiquated, Victorian style gender norms that they claim to be against.",0

6097,6098,"i think people in the comment section are missing the point here. it’s not
about showing a character like arjun reddy, but about the subtext behind the
story. the subtext tries to make a “hero” without identifying the abuse he is
doing. let’s look at an example here. sardar khan in gangs of wasseypur forces
himself on nagma, and nagma falls in love too with him. same foreground, but
let’s look at the subtext. sardar khan has been portrayed as this dark twisted
character by the director. he’s still a likable character but the director
never shies away from discussing his dark behavior as it is. the subtext is
aware of his wrong doings and that’s why it’s okay. now, no one is asking
filmmakers to be overt feminists like kashyap is. i mean nagma does use sardar
for sex, and does start a family with him, for her character has been shown to
be attracted to this abusive guy in the society filled with similar folks. she
decides to marry him and get some leverage in the society. it’s her decision
that the audience can study. rather, kashyap later goes in develop her as this
badass woman who gets sardar killed when she gets wronged. a sudden
development of a strong female character without breaking realism. arjun reddy
is distasteful in 2017-19 era. films like these were a norm till the last
decade. it’s just sad to see people gravitating towards such regressive
thoughts. this conversation also takes me back to javed akhtar’s fantastic
argument breaker. he says don’t get into why the film is bad. but ask people,
if there was no abuse in his actions against women as such, then what was it
that made millions of men get titilated by it. javed used this argument for
pragya thakur’s nomination. he said people are saying pragya doesn’t have
those cases proven against her. to that javed said you ask those people, if
she didn’t do those things, then why is liked. it’s because you think she did
that against the muslims she is famous. or else why is she a hit. a kind of a
twisted analogy, but try to understand it. arjun reddy type films should have
become obsolete, but ....well.",1

3287,3288,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Too often I hear from friends and acquaintances that their partner doesn't make them happy.  That's not their job, that's yours and you can control how you feel.

Congrats on this btw.  I honestly think most people never figure this out - they let others or circumstances dictate how they feel.",0

they see in movies and blaming Bollywood is wrong.Movies and shows have a
great impact on society around the world.When 'The Exorcist' released in
1973,it had such a cultural impact.There is a documentary made on it.People
flocked in theaters to watch that film only because it got word of mouth
publicity for being the scariest movie of it's [time.It](http://time.it/) was
banned in several places but people still took buses to watch the movie in the
next town.The show 'Game Of Thrones', 'Breaking Bad' and 'Dexter' had a lot of
impact on people.They have fan clubs for superhero movies.A lot of people were
committing murders after watching 'Dexter' series.'Gone Girl' inspired a lot
of people to commit similar crimes.'Titanic' had that same effect on people
who were gushing over 'Jack & Rose' romance.K-Pop and K-drama has forced a lot
of women around the world to believe in fairytale romance and they are all
travelling to Korea to find a Korean bf/husband.Japanese manga and anime has a
huge cultural impact on people around the [world.So](http://world.so/),I
personally believe that you are being a little too harsh on Indians for loving
Bollywood.Most Indians are middle class or lower middle class people who are
struggling in their daily life.Sometimes reality is very harsh so they watch
these over the top movies to escape their reality.I do agree that these
cliched romance movies are very misleading and men and women both fall for

He will think he's doing it right so he'll keep doing it which will lead to sexual frustration. Most men like a little life? from their partner. If you're not enjoying it, they're most likely not enjoying it. 

Generally? Also, a cold beer (or his favorite beverage) and 15 minutes of silence when he comes home from work. It sounds antiquated but my guy loves this part. He works about an hour commute from home so he's stressed from work and then a crazy long drive.

Conversely, I would not sacrifice too much of myself for a boyfriend. I'd never quit a job for a boyfriend, or quit school.

4561,4562,"**OYS #4** 

Country still has no lockdown.

Stats: age mid 30, married to wife (mid 30), 3 kids (2, 5, 7). Height 5'9"". Weight: 76 kg (167 lbs). Strong lift 5x5, B 55 kg,+5 OHP 45 kg, DL 70 kg, SQ 90 kg, ROW 50 kg.

Still reading some of the sidebar, The Book of Pook, The seduction method. WISNIFG.

**Physical/training**

Finally got the form issue sorted with BP, hope to see more chest growth coming weeks. Compiled pictures of muscle development and see continuous progress since mid feb when I started. 

Got private boxing training from a friend which was great. Hoping to do this every week.

**Marriage/How not to do MRP**

Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good.

After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down  (crying and  asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed.

Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my  worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good.

Failings:

\- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit

\- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol)

\-  Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that)

\- No real OI when facing denial/indifference.

Success (I think)

\- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats.

\- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly)

\- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval)

\- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account"").

**Mental**

Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes.

**Sex**

After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz.   

**Family**

Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great.

**Social**

Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends.

**Week goals**

\- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success)

\- No losing calm at all (2 week success)

\- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend)

**Shit owning / Goals**

\- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue)

\- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week)

\- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot.

~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here.

~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though.

\- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame.

~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.)

\- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there)

**Mission**

*Not only star in the exciting film of life but direct it as well and make people want to co-cast.*

\- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle.

\- Be financially independent before 60",1

518,519,"I am an homosexual person and proud to be on my homosexuality !  
According to indian constitution we have three genders and homosexuality is
legal in India so if someone is saying NO to homosexuality or transgenders
this means they are not obeying the indian constitution.  
  
I was NCC cadet and when we are in NCC we get a news that army officers or
soldiers sometimes they sexually abuse to girlish or an innocent I am the
witness I saw this and heard during the NCC period.  
Next I have made physical relationship with men who were or still they are
working with defence forces. So no one can come forward and say that in
defence we have no homosexual. There are but they are in closet.  
Second there are many news where soldiers abused or physically harassed girls
so no one can say that if homosexual will join defence so they will tease the
or harass the straight soldiers.  
  
Homosexual people are normal they are not prostitute who need Sex all the
time.  
  
Please don’t respect transgender and homosexual people if you don’t want  
But at least respect your constitution who legalised them

840,841,"You might try reading something like Feynmans The Character of Physical Law.  I thought it gave a good introduction to various concepts without just reciting a bunch of formulas.  Have you learned any calculus?  I found I understood some things better when I looked at back after learning calculus.  Beginner physics courses often bypass needing calculus by just giving derived or integrated equations that apply in particular simplified situations, while some get a better understanding by knowing how the given equations were derived.  


Some people also do better when they start thinking about how those concepts apply in day to day life, and are able to get some sense of scale.  This is particularly an issue in America where you might be using USC in day to day life but SI in the classroom.  Mathematically, I can work out that a 10 kg block with an applied force of 100 N should have an acceleration of 10 ms^(-2).  Then think about something you can relate that to, 10 ms^(-2) is about how fast a dense object will fall, 10 KG is a small/medium size dog, or maybe a bag of onions sold at the grocery store, 100 N is about the weight of that dog or onions.  Highway speeds are around 28 m/s, residential areas might have a speed limit of 11 m/s, a typical walking pace is around 1.4 m/s.  Then if you get a question involving a trolley that has a speed of 2 m/s and applied force of 700 N, you can think of that 700 N being about as hard as you would be able to push something and the 2 m/s as a brisk walk to get an intuitive idea what the result should be before you put pencil to paper.  This also helps as a kind of check in that if you make a mistake in your calculation and get a result of something like the trolley weighing 2000 Kg you might notice it doesnt fit with your intuition from above.  

Then again, sometimes it comes naturally over time as you start recognizing patterns in the questions, or you start getting more complex questions and have to apply those formulas in more complex ways.  Sometimes I found my skills grow when I would forget a particular formula while doing a test and work it out from more fundamental ones.  For example, I might not have always remembered the quadratic formula but I remembered enough from reading how it was derived to apply the same process to a test question.",0

3813,3814,"**OYS 17**: Mid 30s, 6 186lb, \~12%BF (Navy method), Separated, one kid 3yrs (f)

**Week Goals**

* One meditation session 20min  did three.
* 10 min meditation per day  4/7
* Actively reject guilt associated with ex  getting rid of this. Boundaries are what will progress me forwards.
* Stick to boundaries  9/10 did well here.
* Mobility taking some time off then will reset.
* Four morning walks  4/4 I think these are good for getting going in the morning.

**Reading:** NMMNG, MMSLP, Pook, MAP, Side Bar, Unchained male, models, The Eagle and the Dragon, WOTSM, WISNIFG, The dating playbook for men, The subtle art of not giving a fuck, The Rational Male, Awareness, Meditation Book (40%), NMMNG (35%), Stop walking on eggshells (50%). Sidebar.

**Mission:**

* Win each day.

Be a man I respect. A man of strength, courage and wisdom.

**Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.*

* Have used slightly higher does of sleeping tablets this week when stress was high.
* Run to burn off energy/stress.
* Weights three times.
* Seem to be putting on some muscle, not sure if its t-cream or increased calories.
* Had to take a break from all strengthening exercises for knee, ongoing pain since I pushed too hard which is disappointing as I thought it was getting better. Ill give it a few more days off then reset.

**Separation:**

* Ex reacted as I predicted to a letter from my lawyer. Im in a difficult position, she has just stopped allowing overnights for bullshit reasons. If I push it I wont see my daughter at all until I get an urgent court application (assuming I do at this time). If I dont push it she feels like she has won and will be encouraged to do this in the future. I have talked to lawyers (two to triangulate what Im being told)  Im finding the whole thing extremely frustrating. I dropped daughter off the other day and ex brought it all up in front of her. I said dont talk about it in front of daughter and she kept going at me while I got in car and drove off.
* So what am I doing  firstly I stopped. I was getting caught up in ego, then I considered a proper time perspective, in 2 years this will all be locked down legally and Ill have most of what I want. So, while it is frustrating and I want to do something the right play is to wait it out (mediation) then have an urgent application ready to go. I will not stop the money during this time although I legally could, it would look like Im retaliating. Previously I had in my mission (and it came back this week because I felt like writing it) Be a man I respect that man would see the frustration and let it pass over him, he would not react to petty ego games to get a short term ego win at the expense of what he really wants in the medium term. He would not forget to think about 2 years from now because something is happening 2 minutes from now. So that is what Im doing, its frustrating but I am going to do what needs to be done to get the best long term outcome.

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

* I feel better than I have in as long as I can remember. Ex is being annoying but I am in a strong position because I have done the work to get myself here. Life is only going to get better because Im going to keep doing the work to make it better. Im doing things that I want to do and am starting to craft a vision rather than just letting life happen to me.
* Still struggling with the tension of doing what I want and feeling good in the moment and doing what I should do which would progress me towards my goals but does not feel good and goes against some internal resistance.
* Following [u/Tyred\_Biggums](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyred_Biggums/) comment last week I have been thinking about Shame/needy partners and selfishness. Im not sure what I want to do for me, I did the NMMNG activity on this and have a few items. Most of these dont raise any issues e.g. I want to do a rally driving course and probably will. But there are a few that get to other issues. One is own a nice car, buying myself a nice car seems selfish because you could spend that money on the greater good. Im not sure 100% where this comes from but my parents have a part. I imagine my dad being disappointed in my decision. Im clearly still not living in my own frame if Im worried about things like that in the first place. Also, looking at shame and picking needy women I think they are two separate issues that feed into each other. I pick needy women because it makes me feel safe, they need me and so I dont have to worry. I feel shame because I feel like having any needs is wrong and will result in love being taken away, I am defective just by having needs. This feels so typical nice guy that I kept looking for something else but that is what it is. I try to have no needs, I dont inconvenience, I am always trying to do the right thing, when you combine that with picking a needy women and a fear of being alone you get my relationships and my codependency issues.
* Im not sure why I am so worried about being lonely/alone. Sometimes I find MRP very nihilistic and feel empty, Im still not sure what to replace that with. I go camping on my own quite a bit and feel happy and fine when Im doing that but with others I still chase something from that connection that I cant ever get. I need to spend more time thinking about this. Or maybe I dont, maybe I just want to have a nice car a fuck a pair of 19 year olds Im not sure yet.

**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*

* Im concerned my ex is coaching our daughter to say she doesnt want to stay at my house. There have been a few things she has said that leads me to believe this.
* Im worried about exs mental state and the effect that is having on our daughter e.g. her picking up on the anxiety. She has had some tantrums lately, I just try and be there not making a big deal about it all and making sure she knows I love her.
* My plan is to be a stable and safe place where she is always welcome and loved. Im listening to more Janet Lansbury podcasts while I wait for the book to arrive. This is giving me a lot of material to work with.

**Shit to Own:**

* Used porn again to feel better  not sure if I should focus on cutting this now. Its not a huge problem and Im focusing on other things. Long term I will need to at least run periods without it.
* Still think about the relationship sometimes and indulge myself here. Second guessing my decision, thinking how maybe I could make it work etc.
* Scared of being alone.
* Not sure where to go next with my development. I have had that feeling a lot and will just keep pushing and see where I end up.",1

6169,6170,"You are 20 and your SO is 24, which means he was about 22 when you met and started dating. It is rare that men are dating for marriage at that age. It is unlikely that he is dating you with marriage in mind. 

I was a couple of years older than you when I met my husband, who was in his late 20s at the time. We were both dating for marriage and moved in together after only 6 months and were engaged in less than a year and married less than a year after that. 

Very, very little has changed from the time we started living together and now as far as how we act. There is very little distinction between girlfriend and wife. For most women, the only distinction is allowing the government into your relationship through legal marriage. For some women, it may also mean engaging in physical activity outside of hand holding and side hugs. 

Here, I think the real issue is that your SO is not old enough to truly be prepared for marriage. At your age, relationships tend to take much longer before marriage.  Among my husbands friends, those who met their partners in their early 20s took nearly a decade to propose. In contrast, those who met in their partners in their late 20s and early 30s were ready to commit to marriage in 6-12 months.",0

6431,6432,"Guy at my LTRs job is trying fuck herMy LTR of 18 months called me this morning saying she feels guilty. A guy she works with has been flirting with her. She said, she felt bad because she didnt completely negate his sexual behavior and briefly entertained the idea at the time. She has brought him up to me before and she considered him to be one of the few people at work that she could be friendly with, since the place is loaded with overweight, snarky Karens. I asked her if she did anything with him and she said no, which I do believe right now. 

Shes been working at this place for about 3 months and she told me about the guy from the beginning. I sensed it would come to this at some point. I laughed it off and told her oh that must be your work husband. She also told me hes kinda fat and that Im much better looking. If hes working as a nurse, I also know Im more financially stable than him. The guy does know about me and yet he continues to pursue my girl. 

This man has an LTR and a child which he lives with. He told her that his girlfriend would be cool with it if they had a thing on the side and that his gf is also bisexual. I dont know how she responded to him because I didnt take it too seriously when she brought it up. When she told me about it, I said I appreciate your honesty and Im not gonna hold it against you. Is this guy texting you? She said; no he doesnt have my number. Then I said, Ive seen the type of guys that hit on you and Im not worried about any of them lol. She laughed and got slightly offended. My LTR is definitely the type to crave male attention from what I can see and Im sure she was flattered by the fact that this guy pushed up on her. 

My question is, am I going to have to demote this girl to a plate eventually? Is this a major red flag? Whats the likelihood she ends up fucking this dude? Do I have to go down to her job and fight this dude? 

Ive been way too available to this woman for the past 4-5 months. Taking every phone call on her break and spending all my free time with her.

3590,3591,"> it is a cold hard fact, 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women

Check what those numbers represent before comparing them, because last time I saw this discussion it was comparing the  the number of *exclusively male* shelters with the number of shelters that *accept* women. Your sources listed are all YouTube videos - ignore those, and check *their* sources. And if they don't give their sources then, well, disregard everything they say. Don't have time now, but maybe I'll give it a look tomorrow.

> For some dare I say almost all feminists, this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women.

Prime strawman there. I can just as validly say that *all* people who care about men's or equal rights want women to be subservient maid slaves. Equally valid, in that it's not at all valid.

> either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it 

Many of them, if not most, do. They'd tell you this is all largely a facet of Toxic Masculinity, in which society dictates that men shouldn't seek help in the first place (or else they're weak little bitches), and to your other points, that if a domestic violence case is called in, they arrest the man regardless of the situation because man r strog.

Of course, when feminists say this is part of Toxic Masculinity, the brains on the men's rights side tend to turn off and instead focus on attacking feminism as a concept rather than, you know, actually trying to fix the issue.

6086,6087,"the character kabir was shown as a macho man who is a big bad guy, jisko
dekhke sabki fat ti hai  
he drinks, smokes takes drugs and is rich af, but hes also a wasted talent  
he almost kills his patients, slaps his bandi, attempts to rape his fuckbuddy
showing a knife, i guess that about sums up the character, a classic bad guy
that most girls drool over  
secretly many men are like him i'm no saint either,  
i feel pity for whoever idolises or aspires to be like him, specially college
boys will be going gaga over him, trust me kids do not believe whatever they
show in movies  
it looks good in movies, but in reality focus on your career and do what your
parents say they are always right

4036,4037,"She'll never tell you what she really means.I come back to this sub after a 2 year hiatus of regular dwelling. I checked in from time to time, but I never stopped reading books, learning and improving myself.  
  
First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

3288,3289,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

2717,2718,"The Riot TR boards post referenced in this reddit post makes it clear that the issue with the lolskin software is that it enables player to use Riot skins that you normally pay for, for free.

This practice is called ""skin hacking"" or ""skin porting"" and is unanimously rejected by the modern custom skin community. At least, it is the case for VoXskins, the community I'm a part of.

The problem didn't ever stem from the ability to use custom, fan-made skins. Custom skins are something that Rioters actually find pretty cool, and modders are usually very involved players. There's always been a gray area and a tolerance towards us, and it is clear that custom skins haven't ever been a legitimate ban reason.

Any person that was banned because they used custom skins were banned because they installed their mods through a software that was bundled with other unfair features. This was the case with MKLoL / MKJogo, which added an unfair advantage through jungle timers (didn't exist in game at all back then). This is also the case with LoLskin: it isn't an unfair advantage but that software hurts Riot's business strongly by jeopardizing their main source of income. The widespread use of LoLskin is what pushed Riot to decide to make it bannable.

Nowadays, custom skins can be installed using clean software that was developed by members of the custom skins community, that aren't bundled with any features that could pose a problem with Riot's business or give an unfair advantage. The community closely pays attention to what is distributed so that we remain in the best terms with Riot possible.

TL;DR lolskin is bannable because it gave you free skins client-side, not because of custom skins",0

>Feminists dont agree on every point regarding gender disparities. Pasquerella, for example, is not troubled by the lopsided overrepresentation of women in nursing, she said, because there is no evidence men face stigma or discrimination in that field.

I find that hard to believe. I mean, it's anecdotal to be sure, but I have friends and relatives that have gone through nursing programs, and this wasn't their experience at all. It was actually akin to the worst stories that you hear about women in other courses. 

> A paper she co-authored for publication this year -- Choice of Majors: Are Women Really Different From Men? -- reports that girls respond to a variety of influences and are more likely than boys to change majors when they get poor grades in STEM classes. Ironically, female-only programs may diminish their interest and confidence.

Truth is, this is a culture that I think really stands out of if you look at it, and there might be something there there, in certain STEM courses. ""C's get degrees"". ""What do you call a doctor that barely passed their tests. Doctor"" and so on. 

I actually think there's something to be explored here, and that this might be where there's a very real socialization gap. The problem is it's not sexy to talk about. Girls and Women tend to place a higher intrinsic value on grades. And then changing it....again, not something we're comfortable talking about. 

My position is clear...I believe that these barriers exist far less in different environments. It's why I encourage things like commuter schools and online learning. If discrimination is a problem...IMO these are the things we can best do to directly address it. But that stuff is probably off the table.

But I think this sort of results-driven hammering? I don't think it's sustainable, for that very reason. It's too self-contradictory. Unless we're going to straight up say OK, things are going to be draconian until we get to statistical equality, deal with it....but even then, honestly, that's just going to create fights over who gets to be the target of said draconian measures.

411,412,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1

4594,4595,"I dated a very successful woman and it was enjoyable. I also have male friends that would/have reacted the same way as you have described.

What worked for my relationship with the successful woman, is there was a sense of balance. Although she made more money than me. She'd ""allow"" (for lack of a better word) me to pay for things. I once had planned a trip for her birthday. I had bought tickets to a show and surprised her, but I hadn't purchased the plane tickets yet. We talked about it and decided she would pay for airfare and I would pay for the events, lodging, and majority of food. The trip was lovely.

Throughout the relationship we had made a deal. Whoever has the idea, pays. For example if she wants to go to breakfast, she pays. If I mention us going to a movie, I pay. Things like that. 

Although it isn't all about money. She also ""let"" me be dominant in the bedroom. It is important that men feel like we can be men. When a woman tries to stifle that or if we feel unable to provide. We end up lost.

There are many ways other than financial to provide for someone. The men you dated may have been intimidated/insecure of your success. But did you allow them to be men in other situations?

It's often small things. Letting us drive places, build things, take over in the bedroom, make decisions on what we do, etc. Even if you paid for majority of the things, we (men) need to feel some sense of control somewhere in the relationship. If you drive everywhere, if we always take your car, if you pay all the bills, buy all the food. It makes us feel unnecessary.",0

2\. when swara was fucking vibrating herself then you hypocrites were fucking
applauding and the same scene where kabir singh puts ice in his pants that is
toxic masculinity to you  
  
  
3\. now reverese the fucking scene where he slapped her ! if preti slapped him
, you guys would have been applauding ki sahee kiya ! just because a man
slapped a woman so that apprently makes him a bad human being ! even if she
cheats on her partner. you know woman ! this is the fucking problem , when we
say ! "" ladkiya kadam sey kadam chal rai hai mardo k "" its you guys who brings
in this this fucked up biased feminine shit that makes woman categorised in
the weaker section of the society. if you dont are the weaker gender anymore -
"" why do you fucking need a coach in metros"" "" why is there a relaxation of
cut offs for girls in colleges"" "" why is that you guys need seats in buses""
coz you people want woman to be weak so that you guys can enjoy the luxory of
the rights a woman has in this society.  
  
  
4\. when preeti tells kabir to kiss him in college - you guys dint have a
probelm there and or you guys dint fucking reprimanded her character why not ?
i ll tell you why - coz this time "" a man was saying no"" so i guess it dint
pass your peanut sized brain that ya even that should be reprimanded.  
  
  
5\. and the scene where he a""allegedly"" tried to rape that woman over a knife
point - first of all it was mutual she called him she was cheating on her
fiance - nobody wants to fucking highlight that right coz as a woman you can
do whatever the fuck you want to right ?!

slaps a man its always assumed that the man must have done something wrong and
if a man slaps a woman then oh my god how can he do tht !!! grow up fuck face
! and all you feminists out there - stop trying to make a woman feel that they
are weak ! if you have balls to say woman are the same as men ! stop fucking
being a bunch of hypocritical fucks and try to prove deliberetly that they are
weak ! its become a joke these days ! fucking feminists !

There should be a ""Tactics"" flair for these posts, versus ""Theory"" posts.

I never had trouble, generally speaking, with confidence. But all the little behavioral cues that society ingrained into me as ""right"" and ""correct"" had to be shed before I first really  felt the power of TRP. Even little Beta shit like saying ""sorry"" when I bump someone at the store. It all had to be shed, but it also had to be replaced with something.

And for me, anyway, it was finding and implementing the right *tactics* in place of all the bullshit that I was filled up with. So it's great to say ""do not give a fuck"" but how does that actually look in context.

What I find, much like V. reports, is that women will resort to overt communication if you're just nailing the tactics:

3412,3413,"The RedPill on Propaganda in democratic countries from an immigrant from an ex-Communist country using anti-Chinese Propaganda as an exposeeMany in the West claim ""our Press is free and fair and is not controlled by the government and therefore we have NO propaganda!"". I am here to show you how wrong this is. Coming from an ex-communist country, my propaganda detector is well honed. The Propaganda machine in the West is far more insidious than that of a ""totalitarian"" nation. While a ""totalitarian"" nation may blatantly repress dissenting speech and thus make the dissenters look like martyrs, the West - under the guise of free and fair press and under the guise of democracy can shape and influence public opinion and few will be the wiser as there is no blatant repression of speech and thus no obvious tyranny to resist. Furthermore, repressing overt nationalism further aids the propaganda machine, as any anti-country news will be viewed as ""objective"" because it is not overtly nationalistic. But ironically this conception plays into peoples need to identify with a tribe, and people do so subconciously while being able to feel good about themselves that they are non-nationalistic and a fighter for ""democracy"" and ""freedom"".

Why do I write this? Today I have received a blatant anti-chinese propaganda newspaper on my doorstep, from a previously unknown newspaper that is encouraged by the municipal government.

Since we on the redpill are concerned with truth, we should not only be seeking truth in terms of women, but also truths of the world and how the powers that be are attempting to influence our perceptions indirectly. As an unassimilated immigrant it is much easier to see and fight back against attempted mind control, not only because I have seen this in my own country but because I am already distrustful of the culture as a whole.

Attached I present you the first page of this propaganda piece. Not only does the paper present an anti-china stance, it is also an expos on how language is on how language is manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.

It almost feels like we are on war footing, with the level of anti-chinese propaganda occuring and it progressively ramping up. It seems to me that the Western governments do not want this crises to go to waste and are looking to bring down the greatest threat to the Western rule since the fall of the USSR if not since ever.

China is poised on the brink of becoming the new world leader and to wrest control of the world from the United States - if it weathers this storm, I think it will become unstoppable manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.

The Western method of propaganda and influence of the population works in much the same ways that TRP suggests one influences women, through insinuation, implication and plausible deniability - never through direct statement. This is why the Soviet propaganda machine was inferior to that of the US, it operated on absolutes rather than insinuations (at least internally - it was much more effective externally). I recognize this method of propaganda, because this is how the KGB ran its own Propaganda campaigns in Western countries, creating fake papers and journal articles to influence western governments to believe in the possibility of nuclear winter and thus make the idea of nuclear disarmament more plausible.

I write this as a warning to all of you living your daily lives, just as you are wary of women and the bluepill regarding them, be aware that much of the same techniques are used to control and influence your thoughts regarding the political situation in the country. Also, think whether this control is actually in your benefit, because if it was, would there be a need for propaganda campaigns?",0

SOME DO HAVE FEELINGS (if that's good or bad I still don't know myself)...

I think this is a common cause of being ""too nice"" of a person and not getting the results you wanted/expected. Therefore comes the frustration.

I, as a young man of 23 years old, am in the same situation. I had a breakup because apparently I was ""too nice"" for her and wanted to commit into a marriage and have children. By showing that I had emotions and that I deeply cared about her, I think I scared her away??!! (things just started going sour after I opened up to her).

After this breakup, I got involved into TRP community and started buying into all their crap... Barely got to the point of hating all women because of their suppose ""hypergamy"" and all the mind games ""they play"" on us men... But after a while, I realized it's all BS. 

It just depends on the people you meet in your life and the way they think/see things.

Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

Isekai is so steeped in the same cliches, over and over, that it felt *ground breaking* to have the protagonist NOT be beloved by every single character he meets and have to endure a *bad reputation*. I'm not condemning it for not being deep, it's a satisfying popcorn story with some good hooks. I only read the manga and couldn't get far into the anime but when I read it, yeah that shit was engaging. 

That  protagonist gets falsely accused of rape is so controversial because *people can't stand the thought of men being victims or women being villains* is what really blows my mind. Total Duluth Model of kool-aid drinking. 

> The source material was one of the first web light novels to be translated into English, opening a new world of potential readers, and eventually viewers, to an underdog, no-name web novel author. 

I could be wrong but I thought this was standard in Japan? There's no gatekeeping with editors or literary agents so the internet is basically flooded with original fanfics with people voting on what they like. This makes it very easy for authors to copy one another, which is why ever since Sword Art Online blew up isekai has not only become popular but each isekai story is super derivative and formulaic when you compare them to each other. Sure there are a few exceptions but for the most part you can tell exactly what the author had already read/watched when they made their own isekai. The market has become so flooded online that people have started getting *really* creative with their story titles because something as Moonlight Breakfast doesn't quite grab the reader's attention as much as Who In Their Right Mind Would Make Toast With Their Butt. So what happens is officials take a look at what LNs online are popular, the LN gets a real book deal and published in meat space while an anime is adapted asap to cash in on its popularity. The market has also become so flooded that over the past few years they've started to pull away from ""teenage male protagonist"" stories so authors started developing new gimmicks such as reincarnation.",0

1817,1818,"I'm confused by this post. For starters - Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot""? She's an attractive skinny white blond woman who spends her internet time trying to get people to shit on shooting survivors. I guess ""hot"" means looking like idiot mean girl Tomi Lahren?

All of these people style themselves based on high school mean girls and Ann Coulter.

  They're all minions of disgusting right wing mouth breathers who secretly wish we lived in ""Handmaid's Tale"" Gilead, rape was legal, and it would probably be legal to murder ugly women or women and little girls who protested rape with impunity.

She **does** deserve it. No offense OP - but the woman you're posting is right on target, if what she's saying is true.  Fuck Kaitlin Bennett. I enjoy when misogynistic women reap what they sow. You think they're allies? They're not. They're not worth spilling tears for either. And I'm saying this as someone that finds the left as creepy, looksist, and secretly often as misogynistic as the right, so long the selected target is white (maybe Asian), cisgender - shit, even a lot of their attacks on men frequently strike me as fucked up and underwritten by ulterior motives totally divorced from any real, sustainable concept of justice, logic, or interpersonal accountability. Caitlin Jenner - who spent her pre-transition life as a right-wing jock with no interest in problems for women or sexual minorities and apparently has the same politics now, theoretically at her own detriment (but not literally of course - she's rich) - being lauded as a heroine is proof of that, frankly.

I'm just sort of at a loss as to how Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot"" but I don't give a shit if misogynistic women reap what they sow. Fuck right, they deserve it. They're agents of the men who want to put their favorite hookers in cabinet positions (Berlusconi), make rape legal, illegalize any medication or health procedure women need to participate in society as equals/control their own reproduction, and create a right wing theocracy. 

No sympathy.

Also - whoever this LivPosting is, she's not actually a hot chick or any ""hotter"" than Bennett; she strikes me as an average looking woman calling out a blond bimbo wannabe for supporting an ideology that leaves ""not hot"" chicks out in the cold, so...I dunno, what is the point of this post again? 

This woman isn't justifying looksism, she's pointing out the consequences of hypocrisy and being felled when you charge for misogyny and misogynistic ideology while female. Do you not see that? Are you offended because of your politics (in which case, I guess I should apologize for speaking so frankly) and the apparent anti-woman mindset of this Liv Posting? 

Are you really caping for hateful anti-feminists like Kaitlin Bennett, who are even less sympathetic to femcels and ugly women than even shitty corporate ""liberal"" feminists who are as focused on virtue signalling for a paycheck as anything else (like our wonderful friends at Mel Magazine, who have such contempt for the women here they'd lift their posts without asking) and have no empathy for real women if they have a self-serving goal in mind? 

The whole point of these posts is that Kaitlin Bennett supports a misogynistic society where looksism and sexism used against women is embraced. She's a (horrible, hateful, stupid, famewhore) woman without a country.

I'm sorry if you're conservative and that's why you're irked here.


Right and left - be it vocal, performative antifeminism voiced by babes of Fox primetime, Tomi Lahren, Meghan McCain, and Bennett; or highly visible corporatized ""feminist"" values presented by shitty faux-""woke"" startups that are revealed to treat their employees like garbage/shitty ""content"" spewing blogs like Mel, at al are mostly predicated on two things, two gods they worship in kind - self-serving engagement numbers, and money. So they support quashing labor laws and fair wages and fair medical leave and HRs that actually treat sexual harassment seriously and, in Bennett's case, try to jumpstart a career by inciting people to wish murder on high schoolers that watched their friends die, wearing AKs as accessories. On top of whatever right wing woman-hating horseshit she's promoting while hustling for a speaking engagement on the neocon airwaves.

Those antifeminists are the ultimate pickmes and only support feminism (for themselves, primarily, and perhaps women exactly like them) to justify...anti-feminism. To justify pushing the overturning of Roe v Wade. To justify ""my choice is a feminist choice because I have a vagina! (There's no such thing as marital rape! Let's murder gay people and burn witches again! Rah rah rah! Let me show you my tits!)""-style feminism, from their seats of influence, their soap boxes and promotional events. 

They're all united with one idea in mind - so long as I get mine (get my abortion, my featured piece, my seed funding, can roast other women alive for deserving to be harassed/raped, can use a shitty hashtag phonily presenting any incident where a woman is victimized, polarizing men and woman in the aftermath or something like a high profile revelation of a sex crime) - fuck everyone else. Fuck facts. I want the spotlight.

After hearing a million of these stories, I'm convinced that college-age women actually believe they've been raped, in situations where it's clearly not the case.  Brett Solokow, a lawyer representing women in college rape tribunals, has made similar observations.  It's basically delusional hysteria.  

>AVFM: How common do you think it is that those who falsely accuse are punished for their crime/misconduct?

>Sokolow: Rarely. In fact, we often try to get them help. The fact is that most people who allege campus sexual misconduct when it did not occur do in fact believe that it did

EDIT

Women in general have no clue about their state of sexual arousal.  

https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html

This is almost certainly biological, and possibly related to the fact that humans are the only primates that do not go into heat.  Although women have a much lower libido than men, they are at a libido highpoint at this age and have a very tenuous connection to their sexuality.  Add alcohol and it becomes like a multiple personality disorder.  It's like the movie ""Fight Club"" for women.",1

6516,6517,"First of all - with all of our kids I was a mess for a year. I had issues with hormones and PPD coupled with not sleeping?  I was an absolute wreck.  My husband took nights on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) so I could actually sleep.  Do you absolutely have to keep pumping? Can you supplement with formula? 

You really need some self care.  There is nothing that says you never get a break just because you are a mom of a baby. In fact you really, really need a break.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  I realize theres a quarantine on and I dont know where you are - but even if you can go get a coffee and sit in the car with a book for 30 minutes.  

The thing is you have a ton of things going on here: you have an infant you is still at an age that is fully dependent on you.  You probably arent sleeping amazing. You are isolated because of a quarantine (along with the stress of that). You are essentially doing this alone (with some help from your husband).  

The infant is a full time job that never ends.  The house and being a homemaker is a full time job.  There isnt much time for leisure and building up your empty stores (you cannot pour from an empty cup).  Figure out what you need.  One day a week of sleeping in?  3 evenings where you can take a bath? Going out to get coffee? Calling a friend?  I cant answer the question for you.  But what you ARE doing isnt working.  Be specific and then tell your husband I really need sleep and I need one full night of sleep a week.  How can we make that happen? Or whatever it is that you need.  YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM FOR NEEDING THIS nor are you a bad wife.  You, my dear, are human.  

If after replenishing your stores you still dont like things that you used to enjoy - please talk to your doctor about it.  You could have Post Partum Depression.  

A couple of books I really like : Replenish by Lisa Byrne 

Say Goodbye to Survival Mode by Crystal Paine

The transition into motherhood is a hard one.  I feel like as a society its supposed to be this 6 week - all the weight is gone, baby is sleeping all night.  Its okay that you arent okay right now.

Edit-cant believe I forgot this! My advice to all new moms (especially if you are struggling!) is to get outside as much as you can.  I realize it may be hard.  But if you can put baby in a stroller or a carrier and got for a short walk that can make a world of difference.  Even just sitting on the porch or a park bench can be very refreshing instead of being stuck inside all day.",0

2627,2628,"I'm a bit desperate to find an IDE / Editor tool set that actually worksIt's been now a couple of weeks since I've started learning Haskell.
**My impressions so far:**
It's beautiful.

The syntax is clear and unlike other languages like scala you're not constantly wondering: ""Is this actually functionally pure?"", because the language itself won't allow you to write impure code. 

Anyways, now I wanted to start a larger project and learn about game development with the ""SDL2"" library. 

At a first glance game development in haskell sounds like a great idea as it allows you to write nice, stable and composable functions. 

I finally learned enough about stack, cabal and the project structure to get the libraries installed. I wished there was more beginner friendly documentation, but I managed.

**The part I did not manage to get through, is the the environment / toolset part.** And it's not because I need more knowledge, but I'm finding a LOT of bugs that break something.

**Intelli-J default plugin**
* Best experience so far. Easiest to install, but it does not have a debugger as far as I know.

**Intelli-J haskforce**
* Crashes at start. I tried to compile the latest bug-free version but the gradlew script also crashes.

**HIE**
* Crashes. Haven't gotten it to work.

**GHCIDE**
* This one works pretty well, however there are some undocumented errors that happen with certain default files. For example I have to delete ""Setup.hs"" for it to actually work.

There is veeeery little documentation on how to create a ""hie.yaml"" file to exclude these files.

**Phoityne-vscode debugger for VSCODE**
* Crashes as well trying to debug a .hs file that definitely compiles and runs. It complains about some characters when jumping over to the next function.

I'm pretty desperate because so far I have spent much more time trying to build the toolset than to actually code anything.

So, if you allow me the question, what is the current best editor / IDE / toolset combo as of 2020? Something complete and easy to install.

I really don't want to leave haskell, because it's the most popular ""pure"" functional programming option and it's got a lot of documentation and quite a healthy community. I just need something that works :)

3257,3258,"Some of the top viewed stuff on pornhub at one time was supposedly a step brother boning his sleeping stepsister. Thats, rape, incest, and a whoke bunch of wrong all in one. 

Personally I get indulging a kink but this on top of a lot of the sexist practices of the industry... I can totally understand the view that its very problematic. Not everyone sees the difference between porn and reality. 

On top of that...  this is speculative really, but you know how in movies you get a bunch of disclaimers at the end? Nobody was harmed. This was a work of fiction. Nothing was harmed during the making of this etc etc. we dont get as many of those garuntees of safety, respect, and (for lack of a better word) wholesomeness in porn. Especially on tube sites where most of that is cut out anyway. For all we know what were watching is a sex slave and their abuser.

Thats just my personal take on it mind you. Porn and smut is a grey area. But I agree with others on OP. Engaging in safe consensual activity is very different from supporting questionable things the porn industry may do.",0

1193,1194,"The biggest Asshole move a guy did to young femcel. Feel free to share your story.This all happened about 5 years ago...

Somewhere in Southeast Asia...

We were all in high school age...

It started with my cousin, the light skin Chad-lite. 

His friend, the normie 6'0"" basketball player. 

And, the young femcel who was about 14-15 years old. She was brown skinned with severe acne problems. Her dry hair is always at chin length and never grew. 

All of us knew each other because we lived in the same area and played together. Then I moved to Toronto.

One day, cousin called me and CACKLED about what happened. He told me that Basketball player, femcel and him went to the outdoor flea market together after school. The femcel suddenly disappeared. They didn't waste a second to wait for her.

""Bro, let's go!"" his basketball friend told him. 

So the him and his friend left her there and went home without telling her. 

I asked him. ""Bro, why!?""

He said. ""Who the fuck am I to wait for her!? She's not even pretty!""

Well, that was mean. 

Fast forward, the basketball player asked her out, for God knows why. She agreed. He never brought her anywhere in public. Never held her hand. Never showed her affection. 

You wanna know why?

My cousin told me that. ""He dated her because he wanna \*have sex\*.""

Out of every place he could've done, he broke up with her in the CROWDED market after HE TOOK HER VIRGINITY. She ended up breaking down into tears in public in front of at least 100 people. My cousin was cackling, telling me all this.

I feel so bad for her. 

My cousin still not understand a reason on HOW I BECOME A HEARTLESS PERSON.

codes. the draconian laws of ipc section 493, ipc section 495, ipc section 313
and ipc section 509 are misused by many women in india to file false rape and
false sexual harrasment accusations.  
  
police detains men just based on accusations with no evidence and only
releases until proven innocent.  
  
police does not detain women until they are proven guilty, and continue with
them without any evidence.  
  
plus the golddigger women who want to divorce after a short period of time and
steal 50% of ex-husband's property and money through an alimony.  
  
honeytrapping and extorting money from men in a threat of filing a false
complaint

if such things continue to exist in such a ""democracy"" then democracy has to

problems. a stupid system of no good use.  
  
and what happens is those who actually get raped don't get any justice and
those who were never raped misuse the laws.  
  
democrazy is a shitty system , both india and usass are infected with it, and
the supreme court judges in those respective countries purposely create biased
bills to fit their masonic agenda.

Or that black female wakanda scientist in infinity war who was portrayed to be smarter than both Tony Stark and Bruce Banner combined. It was portrayed that way because in reality, men are usually more intelligent than women.

One reason we know that women are weak and stupid is because fantasy and comic books portray the opposite.",1
6118,6119,"​@elva136 see, it is just my personal opinion , but it would be better if you
do not use the over-used words such as 'feminist', 'male entitlement', and
'toxic' when you argue against this movie(or the mentality that has become
this movie).  
  
  
the reason is that there is so much of bullshit that is attached with the
definition of these words, most of it coming from the privileged but dumb
american left and most of the issues that are raised using those words are
concerning only the educated financially independent upper middle class white
women. in india, where there are communities and citizens that have only
slowly started to understand that women are also human beings and not just
properties, we are eons and eons behind the west in the basic understanding of
human rights. so when you appropriate such academic words to the indian
context, there would be a huge distortion in the message you want to convey,
not to mention the meaning lost due to cultural differences. where in the west
their first world issue is to have the right to be topless in public, in india
the public have yet to acknowledge the basic right of a woman to choose what
she wants to wear.  
  
  
furthermore, these words have been parrotted within and without context so
often, that it could mean just about anything but basic right of a woman for
respect, dignity and freedom in the society, especially in a country like
india, where there are women that belong to a wide variety of economic
classes, not to mention segregations based on caste.  
  
  
what i have also observed is that the conservatives of india have also started
to appropriate the words and arguments of the western conservatives, like
'libtards', to nullify such criticisms as against kabir singh. which they
would do easily, because what they are basically nullifying is the dumb
arguments of american left appropriated by the indian liberals. the american
left liberals are nowhere near as rational or educated as indian liberals,
leftists and centrists, while the american conservatives are far more
progressive when compared to the indian conservatives( who are just a bunch of
undemocratic dumb savages).  
  
  
instead of directly using those words in the arguments, arguing using the
rationale behind those words, while keeping in mind the reality of how deep
such discriminations are etched in the fabric of our indian society, would do
more more good, i guess. not for the sake of winning the argument, nor in the
hope that these dumb idiots would understand it somehow. but for the rational
people who still has a flicker of humanity in them, to read such arguments and
spread the message.",1

6094,6095,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

2168,2169,"My improved posture has completely changed how men and women treat me in one dayI recently wanted to stop talking to women to focus on improving myself, and to detox, and very quickly, one of my self improvements was chest up, chin up and shoulders back. The look straighten my body from head to toe, and gave my vibe/look like one of those super confident attractive guys look that you rarely see. I have to admit, the results have been life changing.

This all happened last 48 hours

First off, a lot of women stare, and for much longer. The first women was on a date with a guy at a bar, and in-between small talk with the guy  I had to go to the bathroom. Well, there are mirrors that I can see him and his date as I walk away either direction, and all I saw was this guy's date have the most memorizing stare I've seen on a girl. Right in front of him. Nothing held back. Beautiful girl btw, but I'm not a terrible person, so I would never encourage guy hopping while on a date. The look gave that ""this guy is so interesting"". They haven't been dating long it turns out.

On the same night, a more heavy set girl and her friend stand behind me at the bar. I look behind me, and I see two genuinely nice smiles. I'm not into bigger women, personally, but I still found it really nice.

Next day at work, a female customer did a tripple take at me. One coworker checked me out from head to toe with a smile, and a 2nd coworker is straight up looking to rebound her break up by putting a lot of really cute effort into being close to me, and having me notice her. She does these really attractive/confident stare with a smile. Did a little small talk, but the sexual tension was so intense. I might actually be down for what she's looking for. I actually really liked her sway when she  walked passed me for no reason and then looked back at me to see if I noticed her. Her flirt was up to 11.

 last night, at the bars and club, another heavy girl flat out put my friend down because she thought he was ugly and I was attractive, and said she was down to fuck. That one pissed me off. So I shut her down by letting her know she's shitty. I leave to a new bar, and IMMEDIATELY, a wicked cutie hits on me which I assume is a one nighter she's looking for. I fucked that one up because I was so caught off guard, and ended up saying things that sounded like I was rejecting her. (Oops). I wasn't thinking before I spoke, so I ended up saying things that made her feel hurt.

Finally, my male friend straight up told me I was clearly a really good looking guy. This one felt so nice, because he's a really good dude, and straight men don't normally tell me that. (Bless you)

The rate of attention I got wasn't anywhere close to this before I decided to actually look confident. I also feel more powerful. I'm 6'4, and now look properly strong. Mentally and physically, girls and guy notice my vibe, and want to be around it.

So now it's day three, and about to go to work. And make the bar after. Based on all the attention with my new posture, I look forward to how people will treat me.

Update: at the bar right now. Haven't been looking around much, but have caught two 8s stealing glaces. One of them double takes and held the stare for a long time. Not sure how else to explain this shit.",0
1481,1482,"Rejection does not make you any less of a man.I have approach anxiety right and I am in the process of accepting, learning and loving myself. I have always had an issue about my looks and that has really stifled me in taking action because I know, Ill get rejected. Hear me out, for a 30yr old hard-case newbie, rejection hurts a ton. 

So yesterday, I went to a shopping mall, did some shopping and went out to another store to make an account payment. Whilst there, I was spoke to the girl who was assisting and at some point we had a moment of banter and I was like okay, maybe I should ask her out. 

Once I did the payment, I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime and I got a no. From there I said, its ok, I understand. Weirdly enough, I felt good and I was okay with her choice. Her rejecting me didnt make me any less of a man. 

My mental critic tried to spin it off to say she rejected you because of your horrible crooked teeth (Im getting braces next month) and your horrible face but all I knew was, I was getting somewhere and being rejected doesnt make me any less of a man. 

Ill try to face my approach anxiety and continue to grow. Im really proud of what I did.

Just as an example, there's the example that men are more likely to have physically demanding jobs and to be injured while doing so.

Long answer, I moved countries so I do not know if my experience is relevant.   I understand that my struggles and perspective are different from other people's and usually try to keep out of general discussions. This is not because I disagree with the principle but sometimes with the solutions. While feminism is a global movement, solutions need to take into account the specificity of local culture and history.    


If you are feeling alienated by feminists in your own country, then I think  your local intersectional feminist groups may help.  


I took the liberty of reading a bit more into your post.  If you are personally struggling with the ""sense of shame that comes with showing the wounds from an extremely misogynistic society when a majority of places are much safer"" then may be a support group would more be beneficial than activist groups?",0

You  are going to grow up so, so resilient in ways that these kids will not.  It hurts and I know it's barely any comfort, but honestly, you are  going to be /so/ prepared for the knock-backs in life. You're having to  claw your way into recognition and being taken seriously - what happens  to these pretty people when that starts to fade?

One  of the biggest lessons I've had to teach myself (more due to abusive  father/controlling dynamics, but same theory applies) is to be  warm-blooded, not cold-blooded.

Cold-blooded  people need constant validation from those around them - they seek it  to warm themselves, they're always yearning for what others can give  them. Warm-blooded people find validation and comfort within themselves,  they understand their value and radiate with it, they don't need  outside comforts or input.

Focus  on your own personal goals and you can still have a great life. I live  alone in an apartment right next to work and it's a dream come true, I  work in a field I'm passionate about and have so much spare time to  pursue my hobbies. I'm taken seriously because I've had to force myself  to be, and people know I definitely got where I am based on  achievements.",0

6088,6089,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

3388,3389,"Your body count is quite low. The truth, it's about your physical attractiveness. Guys that seemingly do not have issues with getting women do not need to study seduction or any strategy, why is that? It's because there are a lot of women who enjoy what they are looking at, just like you enjoy what you are looking at when you date someone. 

I don't know why it is that men think just because you have a good job, average in physical appearance and understand some strategy that they should be able to hook up with a woman. It doesn't work like this.. 

Would you date a women who was a 2 in looks but had a great job? Why would a woman want to do that then?...  

You likely have adequate exposure already, it's just that women don't seem to be drawn to you. No psychological strategy is going to work here. If you can humbly admit, that you are probably not the dream guy she has in mind when she thinks of being approached by a male, then you have a shot here. 

You know what women want. The want a good looking guy. Do whatever you need to do to be a good looking guy. Women can put up with a shitty personality, but they will not put up with a an 'okay' looking dude... She only does this when she needs stability and has less options, by then, you have a woman who has goals for the relationship. The I need kids trap and the husband trap.",1

6563,6564,"1. Whatever vibration you put out, you will attract 

A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners.  Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 

2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play 

One of those factors, sadly, are looks. 
And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or  if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good. 

3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok.  it can be used as a form of endearment. 

You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about. 

4. NOTHING BEATS BEING GENUINE

Regardless if youre quirky or weird, or whatever else, there will be someone who will match or even compliment that and appreciate you for that. BUT  dont fuck it up by acting the way some of these posts are telling you to act like.

3787,3788,"Im on my third ebf and have found a few things that I love... 

First, wrap shirts if youre looking for a shirt and pant combo. Theyre easily accessible and look nice with a top heavy figure imo. 

I like to wear dresses, so Ive been wearing the cami dresses from old navy and gap. The tops are adjustable so I loosen them up and slip an arm out when I need to nurse. The tops are also lined so I can get away with not wearing bras with them, even with white ones. I like the midi style cause I feel like theyre more functional while doing housework, but they have shorter ones too. 

As far as bras go when I want a real bra while Im going out and dont have to constantly pull my boobs out I wear a Demi bra from Victoria secret. All other times, which is most of the time, I wear a bralette. They surprisingly give me a pretty good amount of support. I also just found wireless push-up bras from aerie and Im excited to try those out. I hate feeling floppy but also hate underwire when Im breastfeeding. 

Cant think of anything else right now, but if I do Ill let you know. Excited to see what other people suggest too cause I feel like Im in a never ending cycle of breastfeeding lol.",0

___

Women actively look for men who make more money.  Married men make more money not because the wife is cooking and cleaning which somehow helps them earn more, but because their wives saw that they were on promising career trajectories before marrying them:

######Ludwig, V., & Brderl, J. (2018). Is there a male marital wage premium? New evidence from the United States. *American Sociological Review*, 83(4), 744-770. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122418784909?journalCode=asra&

___

A lack of high earning men will cause women to focus on their careers instead of finding a husband.  I believe this study was discussed here in the past:

######Durante, K. M., Griskevicius, V., Simpson, J. A., Cant, S. M., & Tybur, J. M. (2012). Sex ratio and women's career choice: Does a scarcity of men lead women to choose briefcase over baby?. *Journal of personality and social psychology*, 103(1), 121. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22468947

___

A man's wealth is directly correlated with how women rate him.  A similar effect the other way around is small to non existent.  Men select for looks and personality.  Women select, quite literally, for looks and money:

######Wang, G., Cao, M., Sauciuvenaite, J., Bissland, R., Hacker, M., Hambly, C., ... & Speakman, J. R. (2018). Different impacts of resources on opposite sex ratings of physical attractiveness by males and females. *Evolution and Human Behavior*, 39(2), 220-225. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381730315X

___

A loss of income is the single largest predictive factor for a wife wanting to divorce her husband.  The same is not true the other way around.  And interestingly, a wife's inability or refusal to ""cook and clean"" does not effect a husband's willingness to divorce her, either.  I'm not sure if this study goes into this, but my guess is personality issues, things like nagging and harassment, might be the biggest factor for husbands:

######Killewalda, A. (2016). Money, Work, and Marital Stability: Assessing Change in the Gendered Determinants of Divorce. *American Sociological Review*, 81(4), 696-719. https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/akillewald/files/money_work_and_marital_stability.pdf

Multiple studies show that most women aspire to have easy careers, work part time, or otherwise be a stay at home mom supported by a husband.  I've seen estimates from ~65% and up.  This one is 84%:

######https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/

There is a study showing that most men (around 65%) would prefer to be stay at home dads / husbands, so there isn't much of a gender difference here.  Most people regardless of gender prefer to stay home over working a job.  Many would even call it a *privilege*.

Women just have significantly more power and control in the dating and marriage market, so they tend to get their way more often.  In fact there's a plethora of research showing that wives and girlfriends command significantly more power in relationships than men do.  I'll leave those out for the sake of brevity (and for veering outside the scope of the OP) but I can post them if requested.",1

Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general.

Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex.

If they did, society and culture would look completely different.  Even in ""modern"" super liberal attitude countries you see it.  Women just aren't into it.

Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date.  You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience.  Women wouldn't whine about ""cat calling"".  Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women.

If women pursued  sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on.

And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life.  So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't.  Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts.

Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors.  Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero.  if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that.  Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them.

Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do.

Women don't give a shit about sex.  Not really.  they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that?  Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole.

That is low enough in price that you can continuously add new wheat to storage without impacting the bottom line.  You can do the same with beans and rice, but they don't store quite as well, and you can do the same with pasta which also stores well.

End result .. no worries, because you can prep long term with these kinds of dry goods for as long as you want, really .. and yeah, it might not be fun to sit around doing nothing but eating bread and drinking water, but you'd survive.

I mean if you were super worried about some meteor hitting the earth or something, you could literally have half a U.S. standard short ton of wheat (1000lb) for 800 USD, which is like 1.5 MILLION CALORIES ... which at 2000 calories a day would last you like 700 days ..

My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

5398,5399,"High n count and long term relationships. Red Pill truths confirmed by a plate.TL;DR: A plate of mine confirmed red pill truths about how her having a very high N count resulted in not a single meaningful long term relationship that she so wanted to have.

We always read and its been posted many times here that a high N count in women rarely leads to any meaningful, bonding, long term relationships. Well, this time I heard it from the horse's mouth itself - one of my plates. Quick story.

This girl, just turned 25, is a new plate I got from everyone's favorite toilet pastime - tinder. We've fucked a total of 2 times within a few days, both in my car as she lives with some relatives or whatever. Anyway, right before we smashed the second time, we were in the backseat just having some ""heart to heart"" i.e. her getting emotional and telling me her past experiences and spinning the hamster in overdrive. She tells me things about her past how she *went* through the ""slut phase"" (meanwhile her tinder profile still states something like ""looking for fun, etc""), how she's been with many guys, how she doesn't care what the society thinks of her sexually liberating ways, and how she has attachment issues (shocker). 

Then she hits me with ""I think we should hold off on having sex"". I asked what gives, especially since whe already smashed once? She says that she really likes me and is very attracted to me and that she feels we have a ""special connection"" (fuck them proper the first time, fellas) and that she's afraid that I would not stick around for long (ya think?). Now, since she just literally sucked me off for 15 minutes and I'm hard as a rock, I want to stop this hamster from burning out, so I try to salvage the situation. I ask her why she thinks this and that I agree that we do have a unique connection together (lol.. well, sexually anyway). She goes on telling me that she never really had a meaningful relationship (another shocker) and all she had was ""a lot"" of short lived, sexual in nature flings where the guy would just disappear after about a month or two while she would get attached easily, especially after great sex (here I thought she was about to become self aware, but.. nope). 

At this point I said ""Didn't your profile state you're looking for a fun time?"" She replied something like ""Yes, but somehow this particular relationship with you is different and I feel closer to you than to other men I've been with."" I replied that while talking about a serious relationship at this stage is way too premature as we barely know each other at all, only time will tell if we end up getting closer or not. Another important thing I told her was that while the sex is definitely great and since we're in the infatuation stage with each other as it normally happens after two people first hook up, we should not get attached to the feeling and look at things from a practical standpoint. This seemed to calm her down a bit and I let her spin the hamster to a conclusion that all is good. After which we got down to business. 

Obviously I did not want to get into a red pill TED talk with her about how banging every guy she meets is not a healthy way to build any sort of long lasting and bonding relationship, since that would take a few years to unpack fully and you also never want to go into these talks with them since these usually backfire on you (plenty of posts on this in the sub here).",1

3078,3079,"Today Was a Bad Day, and I'm Glad It WasJust want to share a young fella's small epiphany. As simple as it is, it will help me stay on track in the times we're living in.

**Take responsibility for your little prison of flesh and everything else will fall into place.** 

Today was the first day of this pandemic that I felt like it wasn't going to be easy.

In the rare occasions I feel down I tend to think ""Welp that's it, I feel like shit and I have no control over the situation so I guess I'll just feel shit until I don't.""

I know, fkn helpful huh.

Thankfully I've been working on this and a lot more. So after a long day of things just not going my way and my overall state of mind not helping I recognised it was time for a good ol' meditation. I have found that taking a breather can go a long way.

So there I am all zen and shit when I allow my mind to wander a little so I can figure my shit out.

I asked myself what might be one of the oldest questions: Why am I not happy right now?

Well idk I've been taking care of myself. A couple weeks ago I started taking workouts far more seriously (thanks TRP) and doing some yoga too. But hmm now that I think about it such a change in lifestyle can temporarily make you feel drained of energy. I have also been eating well than before BUT HMM now that I think about it I skipped a few meals in the last couple days. And I did (make a conscious decision to) relapse from NoFap today. And yadayadayada

Huh, it makes a whole lotta sense my brain isn't giving me happy chemicals, even tho just a few days ago I was thriving in almost the same routine. I've been on autopilot, haven't I?

So I considered all my past experiences on this contentment subject and looked for the exact things I haven't been doing.

Surprise surprise, it was nothing I didn't already know subconsciously. And yet I had it so perfectly laid out in front of me that I wrote it down and stuck it in the window in front of my desk. Call it a dogma for contentment:

&#x200B;

>**Only by letting go of vices, practicing good habits, and looking after our mind and body,**  
>  
>**we can expect to appreciate life and know what we need**

&#x200B;

""But a disciplined life without dopamine seems so boring!""

You'll be surprised to find how fulfilling it becomes. Not only it's far easier to find contentment, but you also know what you want in order to be happy. 

More specifically, you are more aware of what your body and brain need in order to stay tf out of your way.

Let me break down my experience:

1. **Let go of vices** \- I was doing NoFap and getting laid consistently so I had to make a smooth transition. Space out masturbation and don't fall into porn. Weed (which is everywhere in my social circles) also tends to make me lazy and can get me down. Social media, youtube videos with no valuable content yadayada. 
2.  **Good habits and looking after yourself** \- Exercise, yoga, meditation, staying in touch with people, watching a few sunsets and adding variety to the day through a hobby.
3. **Appreciate Life** \- The day goes by faster, you enjoy the simple things, you feel fulfilled and in the right course.
4.  **Know what you need** \- By going off autopilot and cultivating mindfulness you don't fall back into old habits and you notice what you need as soon as that need arises.

Thank you for reading. Honestly, I wrote this more for myself. My state of mind can be quite volatile, which probably isn't the case for most fellas. But I hope it helps someone. Also if there's any grammar mistakes or incongruencies: English ain't my first language.

The fact that our society doesn't value all men and all work done by any man shows that our society is sick.  Why is the work of a lawyer or a doctor valued, but the work of a janitor isn't?  If all the janitors quit doing their work, we would notice that really fast!

6561,6562,"It seems like you're taking on the masculine role since you're the one saving the guy when its usually the other way around.

I looked at your recent comment history and it seems like you are redpilled about the reality of men and how messed up and unfair expectations of women in relationships can be. You wouldn't sacrifice yourself in a relationship like you would in your fantasies. Super interesting.

When our fantasies contradict with our real life views on things drastically it's  a sign of inner conflicts within us.

There are so many reasons you are attached to this fantasy. It makes you feel righteous. It makes you seem very noble and brave. You might like to play this role of protector for your crush because it gives you control over him. He needs you to survive. He is probably in awe of you. There could some narcissism involved. The fact that you're watching over him even after you've passed on can again show a desire for more control over him. And by being able to watch over him like this it's kind of a way to still be with him. Also this way you also avoid the pressures of being in a relationship with him if you somehow saved him without having to sacrifice yourself and he fell in love with you. If you were in a real relationship with him you would have to rely on who you are in your day to day life to keep him interested and not this super woman role and that could be anxiety inducing and it's less exciting and dramatic. That's why you don't like imagining you two together in a normal relationship. Because then you would become more vulnerable.

It also seems like what you want is beyond love. You might not have earned his love but you got his respect. In the end you are unattainable to him even if he wanted to be with you he can't. There's no way he could ever pay you back when you're gone. He will probably think about you in a higher way than his gf. In a pure way you prefer. He might love you in a deeper way than he loves her because you saved him. She could never do that for him. You probably imagine her as being some basic Stacy while you are unique and extraordinary.

It seems like you really hate the focus to ever be on looks and you only want a guy to like you for non sexual related reasons like your altruism and character, Not your looks. You feel degraded when a guy falls for your looks. You want to be loved for non shallow reasons. You might be sexually repressed. You might feel resentful and mistrustful of men in real life.

So many desires and personality and character traits hidden within us come out in our fantasies.

It could be that you resent the gender roles placed on women. Do you find yourself drawn to female characters who are very strong and defy their gender roles? Like Katniss Everdeen? She volunteered as tribute which can be seen as her sacrificing herself for her younger sister.

Did you grow up with a misogynistic or abusive father? Was your father unromantic and ungentlemanlike towards your mother? Like he doesn't open doors for her or bring her surprise gifts? You never saw him show tenderness to her? or that he valued her for anything besides domestic duties? Was your mother a codependent who did so much for her husband but got no equal effort in return? and you would hate to be like her?

Even if you would never act like a codependent in a real relationship with a guy. In your fantasy there's a lot of co dependent traits showing in your character. Her sacrificing herself for a guy she thinks will never be with her can be seen as masochistic and self defeating. She thinks she has to prove herself to this guy by saving him. She doesn't think she has a value outside of what she can do for someone which is what codependents believe. Her motivations are not actually pure. She wants to be praised and admired. She wants control over this guy.

&#x200B;

By contrast do you find yourself being somewhat drawn to and yet cringing at helpless and very weak female characters like Bella Swan from Twilight? But you would never admit to being drawn to twilight in real life because so much of Bella's appeal to the men who love her is because of her feminine traits. Like her scent and her looks and her clumsiness which makes them hyper vigilant in protecting her placing them in the hero role which makes them feel strong and masculine. She doesn't have to do much to keep them interested. Which you might hate and feel disgusted by. You want a guy to value you for things more than just your looks you want them to value you for being powerful and having virtuous characteristics. She doesn't have to save anyone. It's not her noble character that makes the guys go crazy. Do you feel empty and conflicted about love stories like Twilight? Do stories like Twilight make you feel so many different and mostly negative emotions but yet you feel drawn to it? Because at the end Bella got the guy without sacrificing herself for him. She didn't really do anything. She was just pretty and smelled good and got everything most people desire. Love, children, wealth, beauty, immorality and youth.

Playing the conventionally masculine role means you switch the gender roles and you subconsciously might want to seem stronger than a guy because you have internalized misogyny.

These fantasies are actually not unusual. Men have savior fantasies or hero fantasies and no one would be mocking you if you were a man saying this. Don't take it to heart what ignorant people think about this. The more you focus on how embarrassed you are the less you can dig deeper into understanding yourself. Deep down you might feel suppressed in many ways. You should explore that.",1

Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit
of a common sense are hurt-  
1\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie.  
According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can
just impose whatever you like on her?  
2\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country,
let alone the question of feminism in that scene.  
  
And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned.
For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for
killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be
considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse.

This seems to be a focused attack on young naive boys and girls by some vested interests.  If Indian govt. is really interested, they should check the root cause behind all this.

This happened in news with a weeks time and a boy already suicide, some of them are <15yr olds.

> Meanwhile, a new angle to the controversy has also come out on social media. One of the women who had initially outed the group has had her old conversations leaked which show her sexualising men and using homophobic and misogynistic language. 

> Social media users have been using the term Girls Locker Room to discuss how deeply embedded the problem is.

How would a refugee prove religious persecution? Why have we shown selective
compassion?  
Do you really think it is the right time for India to do an activity like NRC
given the facts that almost 20% population are below poverty line and 30% of
adult population are still illiterate which constitutes more than 50% Women
who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time
such exercise would be of any beneficial to India? Don't you think the CJI and
GOI has wasted our huge 16K Cr rupees in this unsuccessful exercise and if we
live the money aside, look at the extent of trouble and pain people went in
Assam due to this.  
The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC
and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions
added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process.  
You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart and
raises alarm. Is there no value of human life on this land anymore?  
  
I strongly Oppose NRC, Oppose CAA amendment in the current situation.  
Was there any effective effort from GOI to stop the infiltration?  
  
GOI is just find ways to treat us like goats every now and then.  
  
I know, this questions should be thrown at GOI, however, as I see you a so
called representative of the GOI most of the time, so, I am throwing this on
you.  
Moreover, whats wrong with you getting stuck in this stupid debates on who
told what. Everyone around us promote lies everyday. Nobody really bothers
that anymore. Starting from PM to HM to Activist everyone promotes lies
everywhere but no facts. So, Arundhati is no different, where we cannot trust
the PM/CJI for that matter, who is Arundhati in that league. No one cares
about her. I stopped watching your channel, just thought of looking over today
for a change, but nothing changed. Same insensitive arguments and false
narratives. I wish I could say alternate narratives, but I see them clearly to
be false.

1027,1028,"Went to the bar on Valentines NightSo as the title says, I went to the bar on Valentines with my friend because Im a man looking to find a relationship or casual sex. Couldnt go into the bar because my friend forgot his ID. Classic. I decided to be a bro and stay outside with him and try to get lucky that way (I live in a big city so 1am hangouts outside the bar is a possibility). There were two instances where I had a chance.

1.) Theres this very attractive blonde girl about my height with heeled boots by herself on her phone. Time to shine. I walk up to her and say, excuse me! I introduce myself to her. She does the same to me. I tell her that I think she is a very attractive woman as well as that I would like to get to know her. She tells me Im very sweet with a cute puppy dog face and tells me that she has a boyfriend and that hes picking her up soon. I say thats okay and that Id love to be her friend, so I ask her for her number.

Que the boyfriend pulling up on a motorcycle and revving his engine for her to get on. She tells me thats him and I shake her hand as well as tell her it was nice to meet her and I walk away. About 3-5 minutes later I see the motorcycle drive off and same girl with other people hugging someone which appeared to be a friend, so I walk over to her and asked if she was just dumped to which she replies that shes just meeting him somewhere else. Looking back on that second encounter I feel stupid because I couldve said looks like I have a chance to get that number after all or something like that. Is there any other way I could have handled the second encounter?

2.) There was this other attractive brunette girl that kept exchanging looks with me, but I was too enveloped in a conversation with the group that I was interjecting myself in to go over there. Looking back I should have totally went over there for at least a moment. I was actually about to invite that girl into the group and she walked to the parking lot. How couldve I handled that differently?",0

Sometimes this happens with other jacked men too. 

Just before lockdown started, I went to a bar with friends and was hooking up with a friend of a friends gf. We were all there together and I started getting attention from some other girls. Another woman (few years older) tried to hit it off with me in front of everyone and I played it cool and she left for a bit. I didnt initiate anything. Then I went to the toilet and she followed me. My friend clocked it and came to grab me.. he told her to piss off and was angry with me. He said I was supposed to be dating his gfs friend and I wasnt strong enough with the other woman but I could tell he was just jealous that I got attention and he didnt. He was punching me in the ribs calling me stupid but to me it was a translation for Im angry that you got so much attention and I cant get that

Now Im a nice guy. Even when I know other men cant compete with me I dont rub it in their face because honor and respect. And getting girls isnt the goal of my life. I actually want real bros. It just pisses me off that they cant see that and by being nice I get treated like shit its weird. I didnt do anything wrong with this woman. I got attention that I didnt look for.

So my question is how do you be Chad AND likeable at the same time? My friends joke that I look like a fuckboy which means they subconsciously think I look like I fuck a lot of women but they only put a negative spin on it because they cant do the same. They have left me out of the pack so many times as if Im some dishonourable guy who chooses hoes over bros but I never do.

My female friend whos a PHD biologist (a very logical female whos honest about hypergamy) told me that Im a threat to 90% of men. Also at the bar my friends gf told me when she was drunk that Im really handsome and every girl at the bar probably wants to fuck me. My friend didnt hear and neither did the girl I was dating. (Her friend)

So what am I doing wrong and how do I become more likeable? It seems that men dont respect me for whatever reason. Are betas more liked by everyone because theyre softer and more agreeable? I mean Im never an asshole to people but Im always strong in my convictions and never lie. I thought this would command respect from other people but it doesnt seem to. Hmm or maybe thats not it. Its just I have this one friend who everyone loves but hes not alpha at all. Hes adopted the new age mantra and is all about positive vibes etc. Im not like that as Im a realist, but Im not an asshole either. So I dont get it.

He said something like both the partners should have the liberty to touch each

to show how the character handled the situation not how it should be handled &
justifying it does the latter .",0

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The problem is not ""them being whores"". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT.


The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

Lifes too short to call women whores. Lifes too short to even care. Your attitude should be ""fuck it"" and you will be surprised where you end up - it will probably be somewhere close to what you originally wanted.",1

I was just thinking right now about how charli dimelio is completely average facially in the sense that she isnt strikingly beautiful. Her face is just non offensive so that makes her good looking in an upper tier normie way. 

Then I began thinking okay maybe it about her body since she makes dance videos primarily. And again her body is fairly standard for a 15 year old. Shes just thin in that desirable but still achievable way. 

Everything about her is marginally upper tier normieaside from her technical dance skills which are significantly above averageand yet shes RULING a looks based social medium. 

This really got me thinking about how once you are just conservatively above average as a white woman most of the worlds doors are open to you. Everything about Charlis look is inoffensive. I always expected her to be some really genetically blessed girl because of all the hype surrounding her. But her moderately above averageness is what has made her palatable to a large audience.

Charlis a big reminder to me that lookism really doesnt affect white women. The complaint is always about not having the benefits of the best looking white women. But there are benefits exclusive to being an average looking white woman that, in some cases, I would take over being Stacey.

Q - Then why do nice guys do not get girls and they get friend zoned

A -  Bcoz I think they are not being nice properly.. They dropped niceness the moment they get rejected even a little bit.. If they have carried the niceness a long just by enjoying their niceness, girl will get interested. She don't hate you for being nice. She hate you for acting and thinking yourself as a nice guy when clearly you are not one

just one horror of a human being... And it is sad college goers get inspired

Read: MRP sidebar

Reading: Saved MRP Posts

**The Break:**

I took a break from the sub for a while. It was recommended by more experienced guys. I couldn't see it at the time but I was clinging to MRP like a life buoy.

**Mindset:**

I am confident that the work that I am doing is compounding. I can see how I celebrate too early. Instead I will use those times to recalibrate. There is some learned helplessness masked by distractions that I need to deal with.

# MAP

**Physical:**

The home workouts are going well. I will work faster at the gym when it reopens. I will use current frustration to fuel more workouts.

**Money and Material Wealth:**

The work I was doing before the pandemic is steady. It is more demanding. I will systemise more and dedicate the time to new opportunities. That is what I am going to focus on for the rest of the month of May.

My best cash ooportunity is via my creativity. I will set up sales channels for this with the time gained from routinisation.

I am a maker. I can make and manage production teams. The review and reorientation process is my least favorite. This because it doesnt feel like making. This effects my earnings and options. I need to incorporate improvement in these phases into my money and management systems.

**Comfort:**

The comfort I gave myself recently is a few drinks at the weekend. What I am masking is dissatisfaction. I have cut out the weekend drinking to force myself to define what I want more specifically.

There is resentment in the lack of looking after myself first. Previously I have either over battled or bailed. Again the need for calibration raises it head.

HOA made a comment to the effect You cant create for someone what you havent created for yourself. Well...you can. But it is not good. Weve a saying where Im from, The cobblers children go barefoot. Enough of this.

To be congruent you have to build your frame for yourself, not on the promise of favorable outcomes. 


**DHV:**

I was advising on National projects for my countrys response to Covid-19 this coupled with my busy work life, home workout and OYSing has taken on an extra positive halo during the 'crisis'. As the kids say, Im glowed up. But its because of the theatre lights.

This adds to dread. Her compliance is increasing and harpiness is decreasing. The current situation is demonstrating to my family and network that I prepared for this type of work reshuffle for years.

This is resulting in more efforts to keep me and some shitty comfort tests. I have reread some of J10's posts on Shitty Comfort Tests and managed them accordingly. 

I have some residual resentment about AWALT. I will channel this in lifting. And into reflecting on my personality and preferences.

In addition I have been coasting in the sunlight that comes from not being an autist during a pandemic. 

It's time to up my game and take advantage of the free roll Covid has given many of us.


**Personality and Preference:**

This is emerging more. I am making the space to express my preferences by better planning and taking the time to reflect. 

**Sex:**

The sex is always there. I get it when I want it. It's enthusiastic. I'm not here for that anymore. 

There are things I would like to try in bed but it's not a priority. More precisely, its note a priority with my wife in her current body shape. Her tits look great and BJ performance has improved through more nuance and demonstrable hunger. 

The only game i am running is asshole game combined with push/pull and healthy doses of stfu. It works fine at the moment. I could add kino. 

Oneitis is dead but willingness to Nuke the Nuclear Family isnt in play yet. I could do it but would I? 

Early in this process I would have said yes, but anger would have been the fuel. I may say 'yes' again soon and improved preparedness will be the gate to that transition.",0

**Physical**

Apparently my gym (24 Hour Fitness) will be declaring bankruptcy.

**Reading** Models, TRM:PM

Began working on the demographics exercise from Models - what am I? Who is in my sphere, my ""demographic"" and thus who might be attracted to me? Business women who travel 100%? That would be the woman who picked me up last year. Its still academic as NYC is talking about a July or August opening. As I worked on it a question occurred to me: Is wife in the demographic that would be attracted to me? Spoiler: no.

**Mindset**

Maybe it was due to being stuck with no female interaction other then wife, but I need to own the fail day I had last week that was off/on for almost the entire day: While reading thru a disassembly of some hapless n00b in the comments in askMRP I realized I've still got a lot of work still to do myself. PON helped me realize how tied up my ego is in ""being the victim"". And I've been working on the exercises for that. But I'm like Alex j Anderson's passive aggressive evil twin. I'm the unicorn that should not have been cheated on. I'm the only one ever to deal with an alpha widow, etc, etc. Each time I started down this mental spiral I was able to stop - for a time, but then it would sneak back in. The siren call of the self-pitying mope. On the positive side, I have the tools to deal with this, I kept all this to myself (at least I think I did), and I appear to have a ""floor"" that I can climb back up from. 

**Relationship**

It was pointed out to me in last week's comments that she's probably faking it: She's most likely still not attracted to me - she's doing it out of obligation, or to keep me from being Billy Beta Butthurt, etc. Was I trying to ""prove"" something? Be better than him? Am I keeping ""score""? I was for a while, but now I focus on what I feel like. I keep the pedal down on polarity and let it play out however it will.

Overall I find myself laughing at the pathetic loser I used to be, and probably still am. The day after that fail day I actually laughed out loud thinking back to it. What a waste of time that was.  I think that may be my mission: to just enjoy myself. Stop taking myself, or what she thinks, with any seriousness whatsoever. Instead just laugh. Too much other shit going on to get hung up on this ""relationship"" crap.",0

I was just thinking right now about how charli dimelio is completely average facially in the sense that she isnt strikingly beautiful. Her face is just non offensive so that makes her good looking in an upper tier normie way. 

Then I began thinking okay maybe it about her body since she makes dance videos primarily. And again her body is fairly standard for a 15 year old. Shes just thin in that desirable but still achievable way. 

Everything about her is marginally upper tier normieaside from her technical dance skills which are significantly above averageand yet shes RULING a looks based social medium. 

This really got me thinking about how once you are just conservatively above average as a white woman most of the worlds doors are open to you. Everything about Charlis look is inoffensive. I always expected her to be some really genetically blessed girl because of all the hype surrounding her. But her moderately above averageness is what has made her palatable to a large audience.

Charlis a big reminder to me that lookism really doesnt affect white women. The complaint is always about not having the benefits of the best looking white women. But there are benefits exclusive to being an average looking white woman that, in some cases, I would take over being Stacey. 

As a black women you can never been palatable to such a large ground of people no matter your looks level. Thats disheartening.",1

Well... yes. Things tend to go wrong if you treat a woman who has any semblance of self-respect based on redpill rules. Redpill is emotionally abusive and mostly succeeds with vulnerable people, if you try it with someone who has self-esteem, it's not gonna end very well for you. Whatever you were doing until that point was clearly working, why on Earth did you try to ""start trying your arsenal on her""? A relationship is not a war. If it is, you should break up. 

> then it was kinda time when she didn't call me, and I didn't call her, like who is gonna last in this silent battle, I lost, I called her

Don't have ""silent battles"" with people you love. It doesn't end well. Again, if you tried to force the redpill crap on her, she probably had a good reason to be frustrated with you.

Stop caring about what the ""Iron Rules"" say and start thinking for yourself. You two had something good, then you started playing games with her, which she didn't appreciate. Do not rely on dogma. Also, do you actually believe Rule 6? 

I obviously can't tell if you've ruined everything already, but if you're willing to admit that you were wrong to play games, you still might have a chance. Apologise and go back to when you two first started. If she ends it over this, you learned a valuable lesson - treat women like the people they are and don't play mind games with them based on arbitrary rules some random dude made up. Good luck.",0

Yes, women have historically taken on lesser-paying professional roles, which is what my partner was arguing. I get that. But from what I've learned, it goes beyond that.

1. Once he found that she went vacationing to his friend home and lied about it, it's over. Done, kaput. Maybe a single good-bye email and that's it. It's irrecoverable.
2. He tries to speak with her and ""she's not her, she doesn't sound like that."" Implying it's his friend writing. No, It's horrible and confusing, but that's her. It's the lightswitch effect. Once they break up with you, they become strangers, completely another person.
3. She then accuses him of being obsessive, dangerous, to blow her phone and the offers to stay friends. This is a typical break-up response, they are all so similar that I think girls must study this shit in school.  This is a response of you trying to text and communicate to her. You are dead to her at this stage, she finds weird that dead people try to talk to her. So she's not even angry, she think it's spooky. She doesn't know who you are, literally. That's the lightswitch effect. It's over, let it go.
4. After some time, the bitch has the nerve to try to get back with him? he has to be loaded or something like that. And his friend too? wtf, that's weird.",1

Actually the love of the women here is far more than the men. In this film the
female character she see Gabir beyond his flaw that’s what the film is about.
That’s why we need to see love beyond flaws. so Gabir Singh with with all his
flawed character there was a women who still liked him. That’s why some people
liked it.  
  
There were already many films like this already made in Tamil films over the
last decade the idea was to appeal the audience with a male dominated
character to show how an angry person who lives a gal madly and has changed

in the film Mohabbat Ke Dushman another film was acted by Vikram in Tamil film
called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir

4295,4296,"My review--  
I loved it. I loved the hell out of it.  
  
Not because I fanboy over Kabir Singh and his dominating ways. Not because I
liked how he controlled over the entire college campus and marking the girl.
No. If I'd met someone like Kabir Singh, I'd have never accepted him.  
  
I loved because of the storytelling itself. It wasn't a usual story of boy
meets girl, face problems, get married, over. I loved how flawed both
characters were because of which it felt so real at some parts. You could feel
the emotions, the anxiety, the chemistry between the two leads. In many
movies, you don't really feel for a couple. Like they r just put out there for
the sake of the movie. But here they made sense in their own imperfect ways. I
loved how flawed Kabir was. It made him more human. I hated his ways but over
the course of time, so many things happen to him and he does Grow.  
  
I don't know why some critics think this movie is glorifying anger, macho
behaviour, dominance and alcohol. In the movie, no one encourages to do these
things. Infact, if I remember correctly, his parents, brother, friends,
principal-- all of them tell him to STOP. They clearly state it's WRONG. And
he faces the CONSEQUENCES for that. His temporary suspension from college, his
father throwing him out of the house, a case registered against him, losing
his medical license for a few years-- these were all the result of his
behaviour and habits. Very later on, if these Kabir haters observed, they
would see a GROWTH in his behaviour. He stops drinking, gathers a little
patience and reflects on his life. If he was a totally shit character to you
ppl, he wouldn't have told the truth during the court hearing. He wouldn't
have felt guilty at all and would have continued to behave like that. Despite
his issues, he cared for his patients.  
  
As for his behaviour with Preeti, he was sweet and loving with her, most of
the time. Yes, he claimed her and all in the beginning, he never once FORCED
her anything. Preeti wasn't obligated to anything, you see. If she didn't like
going out with him, she would have refused it from the get go. But she clearly
LIKED it. It was her personal choice. Kabir slapped her but Pretti slapped him
too- Multiple times. It was Preeti who made the first move to kiss him. It was
Preeti who begged him not to go. Was that Kabir doing it too? Both of them
faced many things. They deserved their happy ending.

3655,3656,"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and
I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect.",0

Week 4: Style

Long before MRP, I was wearing old shoes and clothes. I just did not give a fuck. Right before I started on my journey, I figured out I needed basic, new shit. Anyways, Ive only touched on the surface, more than likely. I want to develop my own signature style, that screams grown and sexy.

Plan: Re-assess my current wardrobe. Find and throw away anything with a hole in it or fading in color.

Buy shirts, slacks, jeans, etc. that better align with my coming image of how I see myself. (Will be ongoing). Buy some more jewelry. Im a big fan of wrist wear, but only have a MVMT watch and a bracelet thats long overdue for replacing.

DoD Snowball:

Week 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily.

Week 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat.

Week 3: Hygiene, Hair, Cologne: Brushing 3x, flossing 1x, mouthwash 1x (minimum). Keeping body hair trimmed and neat.

Career/Work:

Sticking to the plan. Studying, networking, and looking for/creating opportunities. I've broadened my thinking on this, however, and realized my goals here were quite superficial. I am looking into meaningful work that will satisfy me, and enable me to live the life I want to live. 

This week:

*Im shortening these up, so I may leave out a lot of detail. If anything catches your eye, just reply.*

So, I had a fight with wife. It was all my fault. I was frustrated about some shit she had said, and took it out on her the next day. Yes, passive aggressive and weak. Id like to focus on some takeaways from the experience:

1. My wife pointed out that she had been going to bed early, because she knew that I would justpursue sex. (This is what she did) My takeaway: Im boring and predictable. I alsoforce the sexual experience instead of letting it unfold (as mentioned in NMMNG and TWOTSM).  
2. (Next day) I told her that she could leave if she didnt want to participate as a family. She left and came back multiple times that day. Hysterical each time. I told her I wanted her gone, and to go take a walk for a few hours.My takeaway/actions: I acted like a bitch by giving her an ultimatum. What I mean by this is that I should not have to coax and threaten someone into doing something I want them to doespecially when it comes to participating in my family. My wife is showing me that I am not where I \*thought\* I was with my own mentality. She did threaten divorce, and I called her on her bluff. So, I may bengaf, but I still have a ways to go with frame.
3. I have backed off. I had a covert contract with myself. Half covert contract, half pride and ownership. I was still looking for approval from mommy, and it was showing up in other areas.  

I reset and have reevaluated wtf I was doing and how I was going about it.  I realize that, despite me getting stronger, trying to be more awesome and happy, etc. I was just, slowly, building a covert contract. I didnt have a complete meltdown and light the dynamite, but (almost)everything I was doing was for the wrong reasons despite my good intentions.

Action Plan: Okay, so Im reading sidebar, Im lifting, and Im STFU. Im a whole lot better than I was when I started, but Im still a shithead faggot, eating paint.

1. I am realizing I will fail at this shit, and thats okay. Whats important is to learn and keep pushing forward. I wanted to dump my whole marriage this passed weekend, but that wouldve been the easy way out. Keep pushing.  
2. Learn from these experiences. As David Deida says, What is my woman trying to teach me here? What can I learn from the feminine? How can I find my more masculine source, (who the fuck I really am) through my life experiences with my woman, career, world, etc.?
3. Lead myself first, please myself first. My needs come first.

**Kids:**

My middle son is a mommys boy. My fault. I have not spent enough time with him, giving him the attention and love he deserves. This (probably) explains why he sucks his thumb, insists on sleeping next to mom, and defers to her authority. Ive backed off of using my forceful way of getting him to do what I want him to do. In a lot of ways, Ive used similar tactics with my wife, on him (ultimatums, threats, etc.)  well, the shit doesnt work.  


**Further thoughts:**  


>Further thoughts:I'm finding less and less 'shit' to own. ~~Maybe I'm not looking hard enough?~~

**I wasnt. This hole Im in is deeper than I thought.**

Im working on my mission now and getting back into my masculine by meditating and asking myself what I truly want from life, irrespective of family and expectations held by family members.

Im digging deep and trying to get to the bottom of the question of Who am I.

I see my woman as a representation of the feminine. As such, I have a lot to learn from her and learn about myself as I interact with her moods. I will dance with the feminine instead of seeking to control it.

Girls like emotion, they like uncertainty. Don't constantly shower her with attention. Sometimes when I'm texting my girlfriend, I say that I'm busy today and that I'll get back to her later. Sometimes I'll act a little cold and she'll immediately start wondering why. It keeps her curious and engaged.

I have a question for all the parents who didn't want to have kids and now have them - has life changed for better or for worse? Is it worth having kids? And for all the parents who always wanted to have kids and now regret having them.

WHY do you regret it or WHY are you happy? Be honest, please. 

Me (f28) and my partner (m29) have been together for almost 10 years. Recently we've been having more and more fights about having kids - he doesn't want them and I do. I know you think it's stupid to discuss kids after 10 years of being together. A quick backstory is that when we were dating for about two years, he said to me that he wanted to have a baby with me someday. Over the years he was becoming more and more red pill, saw the negative sides of having kids and told me a few years ago that he doesn't want to have kids (and I get that, there are a lot of bad sides of parenting). The problem is that we love each other so much. We are soulmates. But we know whether we have or we don't have kids, one of us will probably be unhappy. But if I leave him, I know I'll be miserable becuse I love him so much. I also think there is a LOW chance that I meet some other guy who I will love as much as my partner now and who will want to have kids. Me and my partner really get along. I know if I end up leaving him I'll just be miserable.

So I am obviously wondering if we ever end up having kids afterall, how much chance there is for him to be happy. (I'm not intending to get pregnant ""by accident"" because that means I'll be intentionally ruining his life.)

I've always been a believer that being an ugly woman affects more than just your ability to form a romantic relationship with friendships coming in a close second.

Human beings as a whole just don't value you or respect your existence when you're ugly. Any 'friends' that I've had would exploit my insecurities  by either making fun of things I'm self conscious about, give back handed comments, or state ways in which they look better than me ect. They also just didn't value me as much as their other friends. I'd have to message first, always, or risk not hearing from them, ever. They were always curt and impatient towards me, as if I was a nuisance that should be thankful that they waste their time on me.

Because of this I realised a very long time ago that platonic relationships aren't worth my while. I'd love to have a friend but I've yet to find anyone that cares about me even slightly, even the people that seem to be nice to 'everyone'.

A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners.

Then when I go on the date, knowing this is supposed to lead to a hookup, I fail to escalate and make a move because I am so distracted by actively listening to the conversation and paying attention to body language that we have a fun conversation and that's it. She drops hints, but because my mental bandwidth is maxed out, I can't respond to them in the same way I would over text, when my mental bandwith is hardly being used at all. 

I can only do two things at a time, and here I'm required to do three.

* I listen, but ignore body language to be flirty and make moves, but screw it up because it's unnatural and ill-timed (because I'm not paying attention to body language).
* I pay attention to body language and try to make natural, well-timed moves, but now I can't keep the conversation going and things fall flat.
* I listen and keep the conversation going, and I pay attention to body language, but I'm too overloaded for flirtatiousness to enter my mind.

6167,6168,"i am a 27 year old gay man from a small town in up. i am out to my family and
a lot of other people in my life, so it would be easier for me to participate
in the gay pride parades, but the problem is these pride parades happen in big
cities mostly and no where near me. however, lucknow started its pride march
in 2016 and lucknow is near me, so may join lucknow pride in future(didn't see
any youtube video of 2017 pride march in lucknow which i had hoped to attend).
anyways, since i also wanted to contribute to the upliftment of my gay
community i did the following:  
1\. i collected around 1400 mobile numbers of around 850 members of parliament
(the contact details are available on lok sabha and rajya sabha website). and
i wrote the following sms on these numbers:  
""sir/maam, i am a 26 year old homosexual person from u.p. homosexual people
have the same aspirations in life as heterosexual people. kindly change
section 377.""  
i received several call backs but i was too afraid to talk with an mp. though
i chatted with some of them via sms.  
2\. then, i sent all the mps a very elaborate whatsapp message in pure hindi
basically saying gays are the new dalits and homophobia is the new
untouchability. i wish i had saved that message to show you guys. i basically
made humble demand for acknowledgement, education about and protection of
gays.  
this time i received even more encouraging responses. so far so that one of
the mps asked me to visit him in his delhi office. though i excused myself out
of it because i was at lucknow, with a relative and broke. but above all,
again, too intimated to face an mp when i am a nobody and have nobody.
anyways, a lot of those mps still send me messages on festivals, etc.  
3\. i also emailed every mp on their official email id, with the concerns of
gay indians. and again received several positive responses. one interesting
thing that happened is the personal assistant of one of the mps who must have
read my mail called me and said that he has a gay family member and was asking
me how to deal with it basically.  
  
now why i am telling these things to you guys is because i believe we as a
community, the gay community need to up our game and be more focused. pride
marches are great but i am sure it doesn't reach our legislature, judiciary or
executive. so it's my request to reach out to our elected representatives in
the parliament and the supreme court judges with smses, whatsapp messages,
letters and whatnot. and also if you are a small town gay or lesbian, don't be
afraid that your family will not understand when you come out to them. i am
from ghazipur, a small town near varanasi and have a big joint family and have
told almost everyone in my family and they all understand. we have to give
them more credit. i came out to some verbally, to some through letters and to
some through whatsapp message. i also have visited several doctors in small
towns and have told them that i am gay and they all are aware and educated and
ready to help.  
  
i hope my this rather long message helps someone in someway. (feel free to ask
me how to collate 1400 mobile numbers in your phone, send messages in bulk

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

&#x200B;

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

3207,3208,"The way the concept of a patriarchy is abused genuinely scares me.
Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that ""Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world"" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment. 

You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world. There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues. 

The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.

The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.

I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.",0
3442,3443,"Why it's not ""morally"" wrong or hypocritical to sleep with many women yet expect the mother of your kids to not have slept with many menFirst things first, the red pill is amoral, so of course if you don't struggle with this issue then ignore this post. For people like myself who need to have an ethical explanation for what they do, here's why it is fair/not a double standard.

Men and women live different lives and are born with unique gifts and potentials, some overlapping, some not. Despite knowing this and capitalizing on their feminine power, many women (and their clueless simp supporters) will still try to shame men for being very choosy with their wives/common law partners/ mother of their children. 

A man building himself to his ideal man, creating an expanding frame and acquiring intellectual and physical resources will arouse and attract women as he gains momentum. Women may be ""attracted"" to the outward results of his success, but we all know they are ""aroused"" by his upward energy, his alphaness, his mission. Any woman who seduces him on that journey upward is temporarily stopping him. She has grabbed his attention temporarily, and when he busts a nut, he is satisfied where he is. Weak men stay here but an alpha man hops back on the horse and keeps moving upward. He has only been temporarily stopped.

When this man has spent many many years building himself, he may decide he is ready for a kid. This means he is very satisfied with where he is such that he is willing to now sacrifice mental physical and emotional energy into the next generation. He is literally sacrificing himself, his upward progress and his current wealth for this woman and child. This woman is getting a lot from this man- loyalty, tons of investment, and he is giving up a lot of other women who would love to be part of his now really established frame.

All he is asking back from this woman, is that she be worth giving all that up for. What makes her worth giving that up for? Certainty, or as close to it as he can come, that she will stay loyal to his frame. If she has a history of promiscuity, this means she is very willing to jump from frame to frame, giving herself to men in quick succession. Why would I commit to a woman for 18+ years if she can't stick to one frame? For a promiscuous man, the reverse isn't true. The difference is that for men to have sex, they dont need to enter a womans frame. They havent submitted to her and her reality, but the reverse happens for women. He was always simply building and expanding his frame, allowing women to enter temporarily. She on the other hand has been jumping from frame to frame.

So you see, as a man ascends and sleeps with many women along the way, enjoying them and potentially looking out for a LTR material (if hes at the phase), he is not doing damage to his ability to be loyal and invest heavily in a woman and child. This is because he has never submitted to any one woman's frame, he only built his own. The same cannot be said for a promiscuous woman.",1

4105,4106,"The Power Of Teasing - Building Major Sexual Desire In WomenWomen are not use to men rejecting or teasing them.  The hotter she is, the less likely a man has teased or rejected her.  As a matter of fact, if he has, this is the guy she finds the most intriguing.

""Why are you playing games with women""

This is a game that women play with men all the time.  When a man does it back to her, it disarms her.

I wrote a post called  [**How To Be Charismatic With Confidence Coming Out Of Your Pores**](http://theconfidenceskyscraper.com/how-to-be-charismatic-with-confidence-coming-out-of-your-pores/) and it's with the elements I mention in that post and what I'm about to share with you is gonna give you an unfair advantage over your male competition when it comes to women.

So how do you tease a woman?  First and foremost, stop being thirsty to fuck.  Second, this is not teasing that goes nowhere.  The more you tease her, the more intrigued she becomes and the more she will keep you out of the friend zone.

Don't give a woman everything she wants.  When you give her everything she wants, she will start to get bored.  Keep your conversations short.  When the both of you hang out, she will enjoy your time so much more.  So if you only hang out with her for just 10-15 minutes at a time, the more she starts having feelings for you, the longer she's gonna want to spend time with you.

Her: ""What?  You have to leave?  You just got here!"" in a whiny voice.

You: ""Yeah.  I gotta go.  I have to leave for work tomorrow""

Her: ""Wanna spend the night?  I can wash what you're  wearing so you can have something clean for work tomorrow""

This is an example, don't expect this to happen exactly like this.  But you get the idea.  When a woman starts making accommodations for you to spend more time with her, she is doing what men want women to do when they ask her on a date.

Remember that women make time and switch things around for men they're attracted to.  The more desire you build up in her, the less resistance she'll have.  If she's suppose to hang out with her girls, she'll do it earlier or later to make time for you.

If you learn how to focus on building the desire in her, you won't have to worry about sleeping with her... she'll do her best to make sure that it's gonna happen.",1

3162,3163,"TRP Perpetuates ""hypergamy"" on its ownJust found this sub, so I hope it's ok to post this here, but I just wanted to offer a perspective for discussion that's been bothering me:

I'm a woman who's been fortunate to find success in her career, so I end up having a significantly higher income than a lot of men I meet. This isn't something that really concerns me. The way I see it, if we get married, my money becomes *our* money so it doesn't matter in the end as long as my partner can support himself and shares my financial values. However, what I discovered over and over again in the dating pool was that men themselves seemed to have more of an issue with it than I did. 

What was most hurtful was when I would begin seriously dating someone only to discover they felt insecure and resentful about it further down the road. They didn't like their girlfriend picking up the tab for things. They felt stupid waiting for me at home while I worked long hours. They didn't want to play ""second fiddle"" to their girlfriend as they saw it and have my career be the one dictating our living situation. These things hurt their pride and made them feel emasculated.

I don't believe every man is like this. But isn't this how TRP would have men act? The brand of destructive masculinity TRP touts would have you believe that all these things ARE inherently emasculating and negative. Would they allow their girlfriend or wife to have a career that comes up against theirs or be the primary breadwinner in their household? My sense is no.

So what is the end result here? If that's the case, I'm effectively forced into giving up my lucrative career at my partner's behest, or only dating men who equally or more successful than I am who won't feel threatened by me. So wouldn't RP ideology force me into ""hypergamy"" on its own?",0

5346,5347,"Your identity catches up to your actions and vice versa.We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore our habits shape and create our lives and our identity. Our identity does the same in reverse.  

When you decide upon improving yourself, whether you start by eating healthier, working out, cold showers...
you should aim for attaining an identity of someone who eats healthy, who works out, who takes cold showers, not necessarily the act itself.

This is so because, our ego is our biggest factor of motivation for keeping or developing habits. If you perceive yourself in a certain way, you will subconsciously strive to do what makes you remain that way, which is why breaking bad habits is so hard. You are comprised of them (good or bad) 

Most important thing to keep in mind is to have patience and not get discouraged by not seeing immediate results. If you workout once, twice and so on you have to keep doing it until your identity catches up to your actions. When your identity catches up and you are a person who works out on a regular basis no strings attached, then it becomes automatic and requires little to no willpower.

Also don't get dissapointed if you for example have developed a healthy habit of working out, but can't seem to do work/study consistently or whatever else. Each habit requires it's own growing and nurturing, but a carryover effect is real.  Make your life a rolling ball of compounding quality healthy habits and don't go in all at once, start small.",0

3869,3870,"When youre stuck inside patriarchy participating in it can protect you and reward you in some limited ways. Women sometimes laugh at sexist jokes because challenging them would be socially dangerous and sometimes physically dangerous. Women sometimes support abusers over victims because those abusers hold more social capital than their victims. This is an extreme example but consider Harvey Weinstein - the few women who did report him early on lost their careers because of the power he held in the film industry. Other actresses who *definitely* were aware of his behavior continued to work with him because if they also spoke out about it theyd be blacklisted as well. A smaller version happens within social circles.

In your post, you convey that you did a lot of things for your partner's sake that you didn't enjoy, that you were brainwashed by his ideology, and that you isolated yourself from friends.

&#x200B;

That translates to: You were willing to push aside your own boundaries and discomfort, put aside your ability to critically evaluate his ideology, and isolated yourself from other sources of stability and insight.  


It might sound silly, but almost all of us at some point in our lives are willing to do just that when: 1) We're in situations where we don't have much experience, or 2) We have some things about ourselves which cause us to feel insecure and willing to not respect our own wants and needs.  


The important part is to spend time learning more about yourself and figuring out if it was inexperience or insecurity.  If it was mainly inexperience, you can chalk this relationship up to the 'lesson learned' side.  You will know to avoid a man like him in the future when it comes to relationships.  


If it was an insecurity, you'll continue to date the same kind of guy again and again until you strengthen, heal, and understand the things you feel insecure about.  


Sometimes RedPill guys are right when they disparagingly say 'All Women Are Like That'... and sometimes women are right when they say disparagingly say 'All Men Are Like That'.

It's important to learn from this relationship so that you don't partner with another man like that and end up losing friends and disrespecting yourself.

:

When most people hear this they automatically think I mean a girlfriend, fianc or wife. While I think having a partner is important to being happy & full-filled it's not the only important relationship.

A solid relationship with family, high quality friends, and even a strong relationship with yourself are extremely important. The dynamics I've create in each of these have been the backbone to my success. Having people I can count on, people I can learn from and people who raise me up.

:

It took me longer than I'd like to admit to handle this area of my life. I was perfectly content just coasting by with little effort for a few too many years but I decided at some point that I wanted more from myself. My parents didn't work as hard as they did for me to make an average income. Being financially free has allowed me to not only re invest into myself and my business, but also eat where I want, stay where I want, travel where I want and buy what I want. Life isn't only about working hard but also enjoying the fruits of your efforts.

:

Split into 3 parts:

Garbage in = garbage out. I used to love shake shack. If I could have it more than once a week, it would be a no brainer. Problem is I was always tired, slow and lethargic. I would need naps just to get through a day. As soon as I started to care a little more as to what I put in, I had more energy than ever before, and I stopped getting sick. Now? I can't even stomach a shake shack burger even if I tried!

Working out and getting in shape. While I'm no bodybuilder, I'm always working to improve my body and take care of myself physically. If I look good, I feel good.

Rest.

For some reason we've all been sold on the ""KEEP GOING TILL YOU DIE"" mentality. We forget how important rest is for the body, for the mind, for ourselves in general. If you don't take some time to rest your body will force you to do so. (I was so overworked last year that I collapsed in an elevator and smashed my head due to this 'keep going no rest' mentality, wasn't fun)

:
Educating yourself on a continuous basis. Reading books, meditating, learning how to be in control of your emotions when need be (not over reacting) but also being able to express them and experience them when need be. Your mind is capable of more than you give it credit for. If you take care of it, it will take care of you.

      :

Being able to drop your ego and being able to say ""I don't know how to do this, maybe someone can help?""

For a large majority of my life, I held myself back because I was too proud to ask for help. I kept telling myself that I'll figure it out somehow. With that attitude my progress came to a stand still. For years I was lying to myself, till I finally said ok maybe I can use some help. As soon as I did that, every area above accelerated. I had momentum and success in more areas than one and I was able to achieve things I previously could only dream of. Sure I had to invest money to do so, but the trade off vs the results I achieved was a no brainer.

There are people out there willing to help you, you just need to reach out and ask.

Hope this helps

To give some info, I [29F] have been with my boyfriend [30M] in the relationship phase for around 5 months now. We were in the dating phase for around 3 months before he asked me if I was interested in becoming a couple (relationship). I was initially surprised since I felt it was a bit soon for me, but I did (do) like him a lot and thought why not give it a shot and see what happens.

I feel that our chemistry has been very similar to the dating phase to the relationship phase, other than the fact we are dealing with lockdowns right now (like most people around the world). I like him a lot! I really do. But, I have noticed over the last month or so of talking with me, he brings up a lot of interesting topics around me. Last weekend when we were together, we ended up having this conversation where he was saying; *You were riding the cock carousel before you met me.* - things like that.

I did figure out in the dating phase that he liked the YouTuber, Entrepreneurs in Cars, since we talked about a couple of videos that Rich Cooper posted (he likes him). One of the reasons I like my boyfriend a lot is because I feel we can talk about pretty much anything and have good discussions. Im always trying to be the feminine addition to his life and compliment him on his journey. However, I dont like him accusing me of things like riding the cock carousel, or even when he mentioned me possibly monkey branching on him for another guy.

The last few times these comments have come up, it has bothered me quite a bit because I like him a ton. I dont like him accusing me of things that are not true (i.e. I havent rode the CC). Im looking for advice on how to approach this topic if/when it comes up again. For some reason, I feel like it will come up again at a later date and I would like to shut it down completely. Any thoughts or advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated!

rape/molestation/ and other form of sexual abuse kiya hoga.  
baaki bache 10% ki shadow mein, faaltu protests kar rahe hain.  
i refuse to believe that all of these ""falsely accused"" ""india's sons"" are
actually purely innocent. additionally, when will we ever talk about the fact
that more often than not, these people get acquitted in the absence of any
physical evidence. get the ipc and study it carefully, falsely promising a
woman that you will marry her and then leaving her after having sex is rape;
forcing her to give consent/get her drunk to obtain consent is rape; even if
she consented (under any circumstances) but feels uncomfortable to go through
with it because of pain or any other factor, yet the boy keeps doing it, that
is rape. there's more than 10 circumstances that will be considered rape, in
the eyes of the law, but no, everything needs to be created at the male's
convenience. most women are of the same view that women are falsely accusing
men now. let it be decided by the judge, what's false, what's not. who are we
to perform a trial? haven't there been cases where an acquittal took place
despite the girl's repeated pleas that she was raped, which of us took a stand
for her? truth is, in this patriarchal society, men give us ""choices"" at men's
convenience to be followed by women for men's satisfaction. and of course,
when just a tiny population of men is actually sensitive and sensible, the
majority being little pieces of shit, it's not uncommon or unusual that even
the innocent (or ""innocent"") ones would get caught in the hurricane.",1

5408,5409,"You're not a beta becoming an alpha. You're an alpha recovering from a fucking disease!Today I had a fucking epiphany.

I've always thought of myself, deep down in my subconcious, as a beta. No matter what I was trying to do, I was a beta, because I was thinking so of myself.

I made some money... still a beta, cause why not? I somehow fucked some girls... still a beta, cause why not? Worked out, dieted, turned my body into a fucking anciet greek sculpture... still a beta in my mind, cause why not?

No matter what I did, I was a beta. No matter how better I got and how much I advanced, I was still a beta and I was to remain a beta, whatever great achievement I might've had.

**Because I was brainwashed into it!**

This my simple epiphany. We are brainwashed by the society to think very lowly of ourselves, the government wants us as manipulable as possible, so they instill these thoughts in us ever since we're kids.

We, as men, we naturally are alphas, thanks to our biology, thanks to our dick, balls and endocrine system and thanks to our anatomy, we're BUILT BY NATURE to conquer, or at least to relentlessly try to conquer as best as possible.

There's not one single motherfucker out there, who's a natural born beta, there isn't such a thing.

Think of it this way: you start out as an alpha by nature the moment you're born, and your anatomy is there to confirm it. Then, with each passing day, society, friends, family, the government, the massmedia, social media, start fucking with you, a little here, a little there while you're growing up, instilling certain retarded, against your nature thoughts in your brain, which don't benefit you, but benefits them, until you forget your true, masculine, animalistic, conquering nature, thus, you become a little puppet.

This is why you always feel an interior conflict, this is why usually you feel anxiety and depression. You KNOW who you are, deep down. You very well know what the fuck you feel like doing and saying, there's a little voice and instinct in your head that you feel like you should follow because it's gonna turn out good. But just before starting to follow that instinct, you start thinking... ""but what if he thinks I'm a weirdo cause I didn't laught at his joke? Better start fake laughing"", ""but what if she thinks that I'm not a good boy that she can trust, better not tell her how retarded she sounds"", that's the voice of your fake beta that has been instilled in you, taking over your natural alpha instincts.

Retarded ideologies which go against rationality and biology: feminism, gay acceptance, veganism, fat acceptance.

Cheap pleasures such as: 24/7 pornography, junk food, sugar, on demand pointless entertainment (netflix, youtube, tik tok).

Stupid bandaids: anti-depressive pills, pushing any sort of medicine down your throat, getting you addicted to xanax and all that shit.

Mind games: the purposeful lack of certain education, the purposeful miseducation in some areas, slave 9-5 working making you believe you're a champion, meanwhile you're making some other dude rich.

They want you to be a mindless zombie.  ""Don't brag, be humble"" ""Stop judging people"" ""Accept them for who they are"". They want you to have no personality. To be like a falling leaf, floating in whatever direction the wind blows.

They feed you cheap pleasures. Junk food. Stupid entertainment. Crap medicine.  Filling your brain with cheap dopamine.  Keeping you docile, like a tranquiliezed lion in a cage.

You think you're a good man, because you believe in God, you go to work, you get your monthly salary, you fuck your wife and raise your kids, which you do... but you're doing it on their terms. You're not free, you're theirs, until you break out of this mental pattern.

Fuck them.  The only way out of the cage is by forming your OWN opinions.  You don't like fat people? Good, me neither, fuck them, fat shame them until they lose weight.  You don't like hobos? Good, me neither, fuck them, they should go to work and not beg like some losers.

STAND FOR SOMETHING.  If you don't stand for something, any fucking thing at all, there's gonna be an empty spot inside you waiting to be filled.  It's gonna be filled by something else and someone else, unless YOU FILL IT FOR YOURSELF.

According to him all he knows about ovulation is women are more likely to get pregnant and they are gassy.

I don't think politics should be removed from games, because you are forcing particular narratives to be silenced. 

And my particular viewpoint is that any kind of story and political view can work in a game, if the game cares to actually be a good game.

Story-driven games need to focus on the stories itself, and not being preachy. Games can't sacrifice what makes it fun for the sake of a narrative.

I dunno I'd like to think that if someone made a more awesome version of Dynasty Warriors but made it of any particular political viewpoint I'd be against, I'd still play it.

3923,3924,"I've ""learnt"" them in the sense that I believe some of the concepts they teach, ie:

\- Women are hypergamous, they place priority on finance and status and stability. But hypergamy isn't the only thing that women care about. Likewise how men don't always care about looks alone. It's complex.

\- Alpha F\*\*\* and Beta bucks concept makes sense but **to me it applies to both genders**. I'd also be okay with a really great looking woman who's loyal and supportive and all that, yet fun in bed? ""Alpha males"" just seem to give off the vibe that they would be good in bed anyways so perhaps some women who are feeling it at that point of time would be more inclined for casual sex, in this case when they are ovulating which does seem to be the case even with girls I've talked to about ovulation (good friends so we talk about weird stuff all the time..)

\- Spinning plates theory. The number of plates they ask you to have seems abit unnecessary. Nonetheless, having options seems like a good idea.

All in all, i just took away the fact that I need to have more self-respect, self-improvement and I need to be more strategic in the sense that I don't subconsciously put a girl on the pedestal just because she ticks some boxes. I just feel that I have to mature and not be too easily charmed by a girl.

rape is a heinous crime & should be dealt with utmost care and respect for
women, while on the other hand those alleging false allegations against a
person of rape should be punished equally as a person being punished for rape.  
in the name of equality and women empowerment, the society has confused itself
with feminism. a equal society is acceptable, but a feminist society is at all
not. this is the reason why rapes are increasing though there are strict laws
against it in the country.  
when a man slaps a women, he is a criminal and when a girl slaps a man she is
a super hero, why such double standards.

that a man will never and should not fear a women.",1

Gentlemen.... understand this.  A woman who is cheating will lie and deny better than any man who gets accused of lying.  The tears come on.  The ""how can you not trust me"" lines come out.  They will act offended, upset, hurt, etc., that you could accuse them of something so horrible.  And the kicker... they say this with HIS cum still on her breath.  I lived this shit.  It's amazing how far women will carry the betrayal.  Lies.  Trickle truths.  Gaslighting.  Manipulation.

>Today, i hit her with screenshots, she tried running it down, but she couldn't shake them off, line by line for the conversation...

I had to do that once.  When she was in the ""nothing happened"" stage, she showed me edited screenshots, where she deleted PARTS of the conversation.  The conversation made it look like it was all him.  Years later, I found the REAL screenshots in her email. She saved the full conversation for herself before editing the conversation for me to see.  Cheaters will deny everything until faced with facts IN WRITING or IN VIDEO or IN PICTURES.

she gets back to back job from him, she started attracting kangana with that
negative intention . we the public not that fooled, we can see all how it
started, when it started and why it started. if kangana have accepted to do
movies with anurag, then taapsee wouldn't have got her got father and wouldn't
be that big month to attract kangana. kangana rejection has benefit to taapsee
so, she should be thankful to her rather attracting by saying she needs double
filter, which tapsee has started by the way..  
  
  
she felt kind of secured when anurag gave her a job back to back, and she felt
why not i took that opportunity to attract kangana so, that movie mafia gang
will be delighted and get job form them , which every actress wishes for. just
being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in
karan's good book list. by attracting kangana is the fastest way to get a job
from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure
hearted. so, taapsee use that tool intentionally. that is her strategy or plan
to get role from them.  
  
  
  
honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments
deals, but they never put outsider heroine on the top cuz that position only
belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia
play games with outsiders.

4035,4036,"She'll never tell you what she really means.I come back to this sub after a 2 year hiatus of regular dwelling. I checked in from time to time, but I never stopped reading books, learning and improving myself.  
  
First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

I would prefer it if people acted like goddamn adults around the subject of sex, and treated it with the respect it deserves rather than a casual evening's entertainment. I also realize that there are enough people unable or unwilling to do such. I am willing to live with abortion as a result.

If your girlfriend has an abortion and you did not want to be in a relationship with someone who would get an abortion, you did not ask the right questions and get honest responses before having sex. Maybe make sure the person you want to be in a relationship shares your values and goals BEFORE undertaking the act that creates children.",0

3556,3557,"This reminds me of innuendo studios' video series Why are you so Angry? 

He made a few points about how, when you learn something that might make you look bad, your immediate impulse might be to reject it. For example, someone saying ""I can't eat that because I'm vegan"" might make you feel judged so you will react negatively. Even if the vegan doesn't care what you eat, you might feel like their actions present an idea that, if true, could mean that you have been doing something bad for most of your life: eating meat is bad. This makes you feel guilty and judged so you reject the idea and mock the vegan. 

This is explained much better in Innuendo Studio's [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU&list=PLJA_jUddXvY62dhVThbeegLPpvQlR4CjF&index=3&t=0s) but that's the general idea. The video is part 2/6, so sorry if it doesn't make sense without the context of part 1.

3672,3673,"There is grey area...if you just think about regular life in all situations without the red pill perspective, you will find a huge theme of personal growth in common human experiences.

If you think about friendships, employment, or relationships, there are always compromises and things you put up with sometimes this is real, and positive, and helps you maintain a long relationship when times are hard. Sometimes its toxic manipulation. 

But when something occurs that is so offensive to you that you realize youve been lying to yourself to maintain the peace. Then you snap, and its very painful. Plenty of divorces initiated from either party come from the straw that broke the camels back. 

As I said, this could be friendships, or even something like a sibilings relationship. You forgive, you accept, you think about the bigger picture, and then you snap (if the relationship is toxic)

It could be a job, so you rationalize that the pay is low, but its close, or they are lenient about you sick parent being frequently hospitalized, but your coworkers get offered more opportunities. Some of these things seem fair so you just reassure yourself with the positives, until one day you realized you wasted 5 years of your career, or opportunities to be more present with your children, with nothing to show for it. 

Relationships with men are the same. Yes, you should do the things that Laura Doyle speaks of with a man who DESERVES it. Thats the point of vetting. And seriously, ignoring addiction issues? Women who were stuck in loveless marriages with losers, mean spirited, addicted, cheating partners is what caused the feminist wave of the 60s and 70s. You can try and try and try to be a doormat, or pray, or forgive, but thats not a good relationship. Its not healthy for you. Its just convenient for him. 

The purpose of vetting is to find a man that will make your love easy, make your love flow naturally, and spontaneously, a life where conflict makes you feel protected and trustful, not fully responsible for just letting things slide under the rug. Find a man who is responsible, responsible for his own life, and respectful of the emotional support you will provide.

**Mission:**

Win each day.

**Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.*

* Cardio times three (Hill sprints, run, metcon)  these are for mental health more than anything. 
* Weights three sessions
* I go in energy cycles, for a few days Ill need less sleep, be more awake and I think have orgasms that dont feel as good, then Ill be more tired, sleep more, and my orgasms feel betternot sure what the fuck that means. 

**Separation:**

Ex is using daughter as bargaining chip. The mediation process has been surprisingly unbiased after I got rid of the first mediator. I have only done the intake session and Im sure they try and make you feel heard so Ill wait until we actually sit down to make a call. Im doing what needs to be done. If we go to court, I am ready but I suspect this is stressing me out more than I realize (see mood in mental). 

*Guilt*: this is still a major problem for me. My ex has stopped my overnights for no reason and I still feel guilty only paying the mandated child support. Even the mediator asked if I had considered only paying what Im legally required to pay. There are benefits to paying more, but I can't separate how much is guilt and how much is the benefits. 

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

I am trying to focus on just doing what I want. Not putting it through any filters (society or MRP) just what I want. I still need to be very careful with all the covert contracts etc but Im trying to act more authentically and noticing when the shit comes up so I can more quickly move into that space. 

*Mood*: Lower than it has been over the past few weeks. I still have periods of joy but mostly when with my daughter. Feeling more emotional I feel like crying for no reason, watched something sad in a movie, felt like crying... Still mood is better than before the T-Cream. I have been deliberately digging into painful memories/thought patterns and maybe that plus the worry about the STI and ex being a shit with court is wearing on me. Im not entirely sure. 

When feeling flat Im focusing on letting go of shoulds e.g. I should be driven and crushing life and instead just taking the next manageable step. This is helping keep me more productive on these days. E.g. one day I was feeling a bit lazy and annoyed at myself, I should be driven and motivated at all times. But thats bullshit and just uses mental energy on negative thought loops, instead I checked off the productive things I had already done; work, got blood taken, ate healthy and then I went and meditated for 20min and did hill sprints. Consistent forward progress. I will apply my mental energy to this rather than chastising myself for failing. 

*Anger*: I have a lot of it, Im pissed at what happened to my dad, pissed at what happened to me and pissed at my ex. I am struggling to manage my anger at my ex. She is driving us towards court for ridiculous reasons and wont get what she wants out of it. I am praying in the iron temple and upping the cardio, channeling my anger there is helping. Also, Im trying to change the narrative, when I find myself running a skit in my head I replace it with, you have all the big wins already and you are just going to keep building a great life. What do you want right now? 

*Needs*: something that resonated from NMMNG was having needs means being needy and needy represents a one-way ticket to abandonment. I am really starting to see how having emotions was met by a parent shutting down and how this is driving a lot of my current dysfunctional relationship patterns. 

*Caretaking*: this runs so deep, I see myself as the protector from life. I dont know what I have to offer apart from this. I feel like women wouldnt want me unless I provide this. Interestingly the thing thats helping the most is time alone in nature, I feel my life energy I just exist and thats when I feel most whole. Women can want this or not its up to them. But on some level I know its more attractive. Still, new mental models take a while to embed and this is a deep one for me.

*Goals*: last week u/[Blarg\_Risen](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blarg_Risen)  pointed out I need goals. I still need to do some work in this space but I wrote down my values/who I want to be, my 3 month objectives and longer term goals. I read this regularly and am finding it is helping me stay focused. 

**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*

I am present and calm with daughter, I enforce boundaries but give her as much space to experiment with life as I can. Im happy with this area.

She ran away with a boyfriend, found a sponsor, revamped her image, and completely changed her life all because men wanted her. She had all kinds of lovers including powerful men and got to live in luxury. Women didnt have the same opportunities back then to grow businesses or get an education but beauty was the female equivalent to having power.

Nowadays, women have more opportunities to be independent and get a career but I feel like thats made people oblivious to the idea that appearances still matter a lot for women. I actually feel like the stakes are higher nowadays. Now, you have to be educated AND still attractive. Also, beauty standards have become stricter.

Intermediate: Go thru her phone next time you see her. Search all apps, search her texts with keywords, social media. See if there's any communication between them. If there is, hard next the bitch. 

Advanced: Tell her you don't care. Ignore the issue completely. Work on yourself, lift, talk to other girls. Make friends with other girls.

721,722,"My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a ""shit test"", the girl was straight up like ""fuck off"" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.

It's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those ""don't listen to what girls say, see what they do"".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially ""get it"".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.

The only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say ""excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada"". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the ""genuine"" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like ""this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?"". 

Now if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the ""lucky one who wants a compliment"", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in ""models"" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. 

I know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.

TL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",1

A California prosecutor is dropping all charges against a doctor and his girlfriend, alleging that his predecessor manufactured allegations that the couple drugged and sexually assaulted up to 1,000 women.

The stunning turn of events comes a year and a half after the case against [Grant Robicheaux](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-grant-robicheaux-orange-countys-most-eligible-bachelor-accused-of-drugging-raping-women), an orthopedic surgeon who appeared on the TV show *The Online Dating Rituals of the American Male,* and substitute teacher [Cerissa Riley](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cerissa-riley-arrested-for-rapes-with-dr-grant-robicheaux-was-an-evangelical-missionary) exploded into the headlines.

At the time, Orange Countys then-district attorney, Tony Rackauckas, claimed the pair lured women to their Newport Beach home, knocked them unconscious, and raped them.

At a press conference in September 2018, he said investigators had seized hundreds of incriminating videos from the couples phones. Asked whether the number could be as a high as a thousand, Rackauckas said, I think so.

A few months later, though, Rackauckas was out of office, replaced by current DA Todd Spitzer, who eventually ordered a review of the evidence. He says he was appalled by what he found.

**The prior District Attorney and his chief of staff manufactured this case and repeatedly misstated the evidence to lead the public and vulnerable women to believe that these two individuals plied up to 1,000 women with drugs and alcohol in order to sexually assault themand videotape the assaults, Spitzer said in a blistering statement.**

As a result of the complete case review I ordered beginning in July, **we now know that there was not a single video or photograph depicting an unconscious or incapacitated woman being sexually assaulted.**

Rackauckas has not responded to his former rivals allegations. But Robicheauxs attorney praised the reversal...""

So the next time you hear how Bill Cosby must be guilty, just look at all of his accusers, think real hard about it.  If a DA could literally find 1000 accusers out of thin air that a new DA has determined to all be fake, every single one, all of a suddenly it becomes much more plausible that a congo line of fake accusers be rolled out against any man.  Come on, if there was really all that much rape out there, do you think the DAs would have to be inventing ones that don't exist?",0

I understand and respect the arguments put forward here by the author, but I disagree.

My major contention is with the idea that we should avoid working on one area of inequality because it is currently in tension with another area - expressed here as the concept that the disparate impact of childbirth and rearing on women should affect our decisions on conscription. This kind of ""tit-for-tat"" inequality, where the argument is that equality of a sort can be reached by a balance of inequalities, is in my opinion a barrier to progress. Refusing to accept a balance of inequalities does, however, mean we must be careful in our prioritisation of our efforts.",0

4593,4594,"How did you view your intellect compared to those you were in a relationship with? 

Im only a nurse, but we still make good income, and for a few months I was making more than my partner. Now, were making about the same. But, my partner recognized the feminine skills that are involved with a caregiving field, and while I know I have a strong intellect, I admire and look up to him so much. For his ideas, leadership, perspective, Im almost always asking his advice or opinion instead of feeling the need to give him advice. I think these things lessened his insecurity regarding the pay difference, and I always make sure he feels like the man of the house. Id definitely up-play the feminine traits that make you good at your job, and find partners you deeply admire and respect. You cant fake that. 

Honestly, men intimidated enough by income to leave are probably not secure enough in the value they bring to the table as men. I do need my man, not for financial reasons but for 1000 other reasons. Find someone who sees that.

4495,4496,"The Second Arrow  Currently there's an interesting AMA featuring Dr. Laurie Santos, host of the happiness lab. One of her replies contained an old parable I'd learned years ago but had forgotten till I read that thread. For those that struggle with self confidence; insecurities and negative self talk; this was her reply;

*Thats a hard one, as I incorporate a lot of the tips I share with my students from meditation to exercise to trying to protect my time affluence.*

*But if I had to pick one, Id say the most important insight comes from the fact that that we can control our reactions to the bad situations in life. Its an insight that comes from the ancient stoics but also from the Buddhist parable of the second arrow. Which goes something like this Buddha asks his followers if its bad to get hit with an arrow when youre walking down the street, which they quicky agree it is. Then he asks if its worse to get hit with a second arrow. All the followers agree that yup, getting hit with two arrows would suck more. Buddha goes on to explain that the first arrow is our of our control thats all the bad stuff that happens to us in life. But the second arrow is our reaction to those bad events whether we get angry or upset and make things worse. That second arrow is always up to us.*

*And so Id say the biggest insight thats had a positive effect on my own life is NOT to hit myself with that second arrow.* - Dr Laurie Santos 

During my teens I grew up with fairly high expectations. At the time I was expected to work, excel at studies and then contribute wherever else I was required. It's a gruelling weight to bear when there's so much expectation. I was drinking with my uncles and cousins one time and after relaying my woes; one uncle told me not keep shooting myself with *the second arrow*. He then told that same story. At the time I had a deep seeded doubt that the path I was forced upon; I wasn't up to. Insecurities, self doubt and my negative internal dialogue were eroding my confidence. Gaining that perspective however, then applying it; changed my world view. It irrevocably changed my frame. 

We all face adversity. Frame; and the base of its strength comes from a choice. We don't have a choice getting shot with the first arrow; **but we CAN consciously chose not to shoot ourselves with the second arrow.**

My question is in regard to your mention of having 40 year old friendships. I have really struggled to find. Men, that would make good friends. . I had a few guys that I'd known for more than 20 years, but Those relationships fall apart when the females they are involved with pressure them to break contact with friends and family in the predictable way. They are too blue pilled to make their own decisions in this regard. 

How do you suggest finding red pilled guys to bond with? Have you ever had to wait for the if and when of a former friend coming out of the blue pilled haze? Have you found a way to be friends with blue pilled guys despite the lack of common values and the obstacles females impose on them?

4445,4446,"Women have zero interest in sex *compared to a man*.

Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general.

Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex.

If they did, society and culture would look completely different.  Even in ""modern"" super liberal attitude countries you see it.  Women just aren't into it.

Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date.  You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience.  Women wouldn't whine about ""cat calling"".  Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women.

If women pursued  sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on.

And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life.  So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't.  Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts.

Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors.  Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero.  if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that.  Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them.

Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do.

Women don't give a shit about sex.  Not really.  they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that?  Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole.

818,819,"Pretentious Indie Game SimulatorHi folks, I'm just your average non-binary/genderfluid/trans/differently-abled/autistic/immigrant indie developer from San Francisco.  


The last few years of my life have been very difficult . People have called me mean names on the internet for voicing my empathetic and well-researched opinion on the benefits of veganism. I received so many death threats and dick pics online that I  wasn't able to focus on doing my job. I just couldn't manage to play and  review the latest AAA games for 8 hours everyday. I was very concerned  about my life and mental health.   


So I decided to quit my stressful job working as a part-time writer for a gaming website and moved back to my father's mansion in LA. It was very hard to go back to a  life of solitude after having being used to the chaos of San Francisco.  


While  I lived in LA, I had the extremely difficult job of catching up on all the backlog of games that I had reviewed at my last job without playing.  Through this I discovered something about myself. I discovered my passion for copying other people's ideas and passing them off as my own.  


I knew what I had to do. I had to make my own game. It was literally the only way I could make my voice known.  


I  felt validated when my first post about the game got over a thousand likes. I was so proud that my amazing idea resonated with my 15000+  followers on Twitter. I knew I was onto something special when all my game journalist friends retweeted all of my 74 blog posts about how difficult it was to learn RPG maker to make this game. The idea was so  great that I managed to get the game funded without any sort of  marketing at all! It just goes to show that a good idea is all you need  to really create hype around your game.  


I'm proud to reveal that  I've spent the last 7 months of my life working on my magnum opus. I've put up 3 months of wages on the line into buying the assets for this game. I work on the game all the time. It is so hard to manage with my offshore programming team due to time zone differences. When I'm not streaming obscure 80s DOS games in my pajamas from my bedroom, I am either engaging with the game's backers or trying to explain to my programmer who barely speaks English that I want the game to use a  custom game engine to build the world's most high performance and cross-platform visual novel.  


I like to make games that express how I  really feel inside. I like to express myself online because I can't do that in the real world due to my repressed, shy, and introverted personality.  


This game recounts the first heartbreak in my life when I wasn't asked out to the dance by my high school's quarterback and instead had to settle for a linebacker. It also deals with my childhood's most traumatic horse polo incident. It recalls the liberating feeling when I and my ex-girlfriend simultaneously got our third abortion. It tells the story of a fish out of the water, ignored, who jumps out to discover that the sunshine is just an illusion perpetrated by the capitalist patriarchy.  


This is my story. This is my voice. This is my soul.

Then cold read some things about her (""you look like a (insert occupation here/______ major)"").  If she isn't receptive smile, say ""have a nice day"" and move on.  If she isn't showing any sign she wants you to go away, take the convo towards finding a common interest.  If you find one, ask for her number to do that interest together.  If she says no, say ""take it as a compliment"" and eject.  

Approach instantly too (3 seconds rule), because lingering or following her around the store to approach is creepy.  Also try approaching in different locations as to avoid running into the same girls over and over.  And don't go for a hug or anything physical on the approach (but do hold strong eye contact).",1

A disease marks you up and leaves a scar?  Maybe your surgeon will lower the price a bit in pity.  If it is not affecting your ability to live, most plastic surgery and reconstruction is expensive as hell.  Mastectomy patients dont get reconstruction free.  Cancer patients have to fight like hell to get a wig for heavens sake.  Cant see a barn?  You get glasses or contacts because lasik and lasers are cosmetic.  If there is any accommodation to get around a problem, you dont qualify for free.  Missing blinking limbs?  You get a prosthetic sometimes.

6150,6151,"homosexuality is a disorder, created by a warped cognition.  
  
humans evolved with specific emotions and organs with a goal in mind. for
instance, males developed penises for reproduction. how does nature encourage
one to reproduce? sexual attraction. how does nature encourage one to
reproduce again after already done so? sexual pleasure that releases dopamine
that happens after release of sperm or female orgasm.  
  
other forms of love exist just to develop social bonds which creates a herd
group since humans are social animals. males and females were not meant to
have sex with the same sex. friendship? yes. sex in the butt or fingering? no.  
  
homosexuals that still have vaginas and penises are going against their
natural evolution and experience feelings that are abnormal in how nature
intended. biology isn't perfect (yes, psychology is biology with behaviorism).

3275,3276,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

Ive read all the recommended books here. Ive studied seduction and attraction for years. Ive read the sidebar. At this point I feel that Ive got an information overload and that it has fucked my brain up, honestly.

I am 24 and have had sex with 13 girls. Im currently on a 2 year dry spell.

Heres a breakdown of where I met the women Ive fucked:

 **School**: 3

 **Tinder**: 6

 **Work**: 4

I am not in school now. Tinder doesnt work for me anymore. My current job has no attractive females.

I am a decent looking dude and understand the many concepts of seduction and attraction. However, with the only three areas that Ive had success with women out of the picture, Ive got no clue where to meet women to end this dry spell.

Im not depressed about it or anything, I actually really value my time alone. I just think its time to smash some walls or maybe put myself into a position to have a selection of girls that I can choose from to have a intimate relationship with.

And once in a while I stumble on a detail about game that I haven't figured out.

In my first year I went by the 'hell yes hell no principle'. Thinking that if women flaked or did any sign of disinterest I moved on.

But now I have more experience I start to notice that it isn't this straight forward at all. I had a date for example where the girl wanted to leave. I turned it around and had a f close. Same with reinitiating  contact. Girl doesn't answer texts says she is busy but 2 months later we still hook up.

I was far too negative. Having a short fuse to think women aren't into me by the first sign of trouble.

Ofcourse if a girl is bothering me with her behavior I let it go. But if I am less insecure about it I just try again and to my suprise I often get what I want.

So I am thinking about the double text.

6095,6096,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.

Yes, I think a lot of us do this as well, even normies.

> Is this ""maladaptive"", and is there anything wrong with that?

It depends. Like I said, daydreaming is something even normies/NT's will do, it doesn't necessarily have to be bad.

&nbsp;

It becomes ""maladaptive"" when it's used as your preferred coping mechanism for loneliness or boredom (just two examples). Daydreaming might feel nice at the moment you engage in it, but especially the maladaptive kind will take up significant chunks of free time that you could be using to solve the underlying problems that are causing you to daydream in the first place.

&nbsp;

Indicators of daydreaming being maladaptive are for example:

- making facial expressions/talking during daydreaming sessions

- feeling distressed when something is preventing you from daydreaming

- preferring daydreaming over real life activities/socializing

After hearing a million of these stories, I'm convinced that college-age women actually believe they've been raped, in situations where it's clearly not the case.  Brett Solokow, a lawyer representing women in college rape tribunals, has made similar observations.  It's basically delusional hysteria.

Women in general have no clue about their state of sexual arousal.  

https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/magazine/25desire-t.html

This is almost certainly biological, and possibly related to the fact that humans are the only primates that do not go into heat.  Although women have a much lower libido than men, they are at a libido highpoint at this age and have a very tenuous connection to their sexuality.  Add alcohol and it becomes like a multiple personality disorder.  It's like the movie ""Fight Club"" for women.",1

4447,4448,"Women have zero interest in sex *compared to a man*.

Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general.

Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex.

If they did, society and culture would look completely different.  Even in ""modern"" super liberal attitude countries you see it.  Women just aren't into it.

Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date.  You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience.  Women wouldn't whine about ""cat calling"".  Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women.

If women pursued  sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on.

And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life.  So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't.  Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts.

Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors.  Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero.  if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that.  Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them.

Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do.

Women don't give a shit about sex.  Not really.  they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that?  Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole.

If you ask sociologists, it's about being more likely to be accused and sentenced for crimes. Also something about discrimination in the first place, and less verbal and social skills making them have more difficult time to defend themselves against accusation. Some will go on with religious beliefs about patriarchy and toxic masculinity.

If you ask evolutionary psychologists, it's about status and access to women, in other words men committing crimes for the benefit of women or for their positive attention.

Regardless, even normalized for the same crimes, out of the accused, men are disproportionally more often sentenced than women and out of the sentenced ones, they're getting harsher sentences than women. Men are also less likely to get any help and are discriminated against by the police when they're victims of crimes. It goes on and on, and the OP of the crossposted article has plenty of good sources, also see the bonus sources chapter.

6385,6386,"People assume any approach is a sexual approach because it's no longer common to have casual friendsApparently a portion of people below the age of 30 think a man inviting a woman over for a drink is a form of sexual harassment. And this mentality appears to have spread to many fields of daily life; if anyone talks to me it's because they want to fuck me.

And I thought, why do people think like this now? This idea that if anyone of the opposite sex interacts with you there's a high chance they're just interested in getting you to bed.

It's technology and the rise of voluntary self-isolation. That's the cause. Over the past 30 years people in developed countries have learned to spend more time connected to their electronic devices than actually talking to others in bars, cafes, etc. How many people of the overall population spend 3 hours a day chatting with friends, neighbors, coworkers and acquaintances in person? And how many spend 3 hours a day browsing the internet?

Even mundane things like talking with your neighbors or trying to spark a conversation at a bus stop. People, especially younger people, just prefer to stick to their phone, and doing otherwise is often seen as an awkward attempt to converse with a complete stranger. Many folks don't even consider the idea because they have no interest in talking to people around them at all.

[A study by YouGov found that people below the age of 25 had the fewest friends and the fewest acquaintances](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/07/30/loneliness-friendship-new-friends-poll-survey), meaning they're lonelier than people of older age groups. Every new generation appears to do worse in this aspect so it is safe to assume the generation younger than this one, Generation Z or ""Zoomers"", will be even lonelier. And this definitely has been influenced, very likely to a high degree, maybe even directly caused, by the raise of personal devices.

Having friends of the opposite sex that you have no interest in dating or having sex with has become such a rare situation that most people don't even consider that scenario as a possibility. Everyone assumes that if a man shows interest in a woman or if a woman shows interest in a man there must be, by necessity, some sexual interest between the two of them.

In fact, this even affects people of the same sex. It is becoming more and more difficult to present [male friendships without people assuming the dudes are gay inside](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/42/51/bb4251056186c8c04dc36e8a76ce0f97.jpg), to the point where folks [insist that two cartoon characters are gay simply to pitch them together](https://www.thegamer.com/stop-lying-nintendo-cj-and-flick-are-gay/). I have seen this among my friends, both women and men: every time two guys show any more affection than a fist bump or a high five several people comment if they're bi or not. My friends laughed at the 1917 movie because for them two guys being friends during war is definitely a sign they're gay.

EDIT: This has even affected soooo many comics characters like Wolverine and freaking everyone. You have a social outcast, a depressed loner, a dude from another era who has seen all his friends die and hates himself and struggles to even get by and one day he manages to make a friend despite the brutal depression, like Nightcrawler or Bucky or whatever, and they hang out and tell each other their insecurities and drink beer together and... It's wholesome, they finally made exactly what they needed: a friend. And then a gay writer comes along and goes ""This is going to be sexual now, this is now driven by sexual interests instead of friendship or camaraderie. I know it's toxic to sexualize and romanticize depression and suicidal thoughts, but you know what these characters need? Gay sex.""

**Despite the social isolation** and the raise of friendlessness, there is one aspect of life that can never be satisfied without physical contact: sex. People have become less likely to go out to make friends, but more likely to go out to get laid. The impulse to have sex still drives people to talk to strangers and younger generations have become more open about casual sex and approaching strangers with the clear intent of fucking.

As a result of this, if you get approached by a stranger in public, the chances of them wanting to be your friend are lower than ever before in history and at the same time the chances of them wanting to bang you are highest than ever before.

**Change My View**: People assume the worst of any interaction because wanting to make friends has become less common than ever but openly wanting to fuck has become more common than ever.",0

5234,5235,"A Man's Worst EnemyDiscussed in greater detail on my [daily video.](https://youtu.be/n7msLY3sEjQ)

There lurks an enemy in the soul of every man. So insidious is the enemy that many cannot even see it or know it.  

It is the difference between a rich man and a poor man. A CEO and an underling. A 'has' and a 'has not'. Someone who learns from those who have paved a successful path and someone who complains that they can't be successful and gives excuses.  

That enemy of man is Instant Gratification.  

**Examples include:** 

\-Eating a sugary treat when you know you should eat healthy 

\-Hitting the snooze button instead of jumping out of bed and working out 

\-Going out with friends instead of studying finishing that project or studying for that exam 

\-Taking out a high interest loan and eventually shelling out way more money for it instead of saving for it and paying with cash 

\-Playing video games instead of building out a business or brand or any other passion that could actually make you money 

\-Looking at porn and shooting your mojo into a tissue instead of letting it build up and guiding you into starting new relationships

In the end, all of these things come down to you being addicted to dopamine. Your body will supply you with dopamine when you do any of the above and there are many more examples than what I just listed.  

So what is the answer to fighting this? Well that should be obvious.  

The ally in this fight is Delayed Gratification. But how do we get in contact with this ally?  

You can throw away your video games and your drugs if you need to. It's an extreme method of control, but if you are constantly succumbing to instant gratification it is something to consider.  

One of my favorite ways to do that is this:  

Get in touch with your 'future-self' and ask yourself now what you wish you had done as your 'past-self.'  

For example... where do you want to be in 20 years? Perhaps a nice house on some big land. 3 cars. Maybe some kids. Maybe not. But do you really want to be living in your parents basement or with roommates? What is your 50 year old self going to say to your 25 year old self? Let me tell you this... as a 34 year old man I curse my 21 year old self. I had ample opportunity to be in the military.. to study hard.. to lift weights earlier.. to be much more successful earlier on. But no, I pissed my early and mid 20s away with video games, marijuana and porn. Yes I still bedded women but for what? My success today is largely based on choices I made in my 30s. My 50 year old self has desires and I cannot let that future man down.

3584,3585,"1 in 4 men experience rape/ violence and/or stalking by an intimate patner - yet there are 2 mens shelters in US compared to 2000+ for women. Abuse is an awful crime and we must take a more fair approach when deciding how we offer resources to victims.This is not to downplay any abuse suffered by women. And there are myriad platforms this is discussed in. My personal take is not to gender this issue and to deal with violence in general (yes we accept there are gender differences, in this case actually a lot so we act differently AS APPROPRIATE and ONLY WHERE NEEDED but we tackle the issue AS A WHOLE from the outset, using gendered laws and terms only when there is a good reason). However, this is not a commonly held view. For some dare I say almost all feminists, this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women. **This is not a ""feeling"" or a sentiment that you can deny by simply saying ""i don't so its not true, feminists do support men""** \- it is a cold hard fact, 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women as a result of where they have focused their attention in reality, biased policies and campaigns only focusing on women; multiple specific gendered domestic violence acts and laws yet always and exclsively for women alone.

The soloution: either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it with cold hard ACTUAL change/ lobbying/ campagning/ funding/ (not just ""yeah men can be victims too we care"") OR they need to allow MRA's to approach the issue without the constanst blocking/ banning/ no platforming MRAs who do receive. Even the sheer outrage when we mention statistics.  ***Legendary feminist ERIN PIZZEY opened the first battered shelter for women in the world. When she attempted to do so for men, many years later she received death threats and rape threats by other feminists. Domestic violence, was raised in the mens conference at the university of Cambridge. This event was savagely no platformed/ protested and by (some) feminists and they even played bells to stop the speakers from being heard.***

1. Other points, is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states such as ""male assualts female"" which is a specific offence in some US states and commonwealth countries. Entirely uncessary, as it is covered under normal gender neutral law, and it makes no sesne why there should not be a ""female assualts male"" law or female assualts child and so on.
2. In countries such as Australia there are no mandatory courses abusers who are women who are domestic abusers on avoidin violence, yet there are for men against women. This is one of countless over sights and gendered centric approaches, that currently taget one gender only.
3. Either gender neutral violence acts (that of course leave room for even significantly different approaches to the genders, as it is very different) or specific acts that cover mens abuse, as there will be differences.
4. The law needs rapidly gender neutralisisng and services refocused so we avoid regular occurences were male victims who call the police are being arrested or leaving the home!

5544,5545,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

Particularly for young and naive girls, the porn industry can be so brutal. Few actors are able to make a real career of it, and any involvement leads you down a path where society shuns you. There is no such thing as only doing porn for a few years to get you through college, but that's an idea that some people seem to have when they do it. When porn comes up in your background check, you aren't getting the job, and now there's barely any money in porn at all. Free porn is everywhere, and this has a serious impact on actor pay.

I hope you all get my message well.  
Last year in April I have arranged for my sister's wedding. We all were happy
and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their
demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband
and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from
Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times
police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become
innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my
sister. One day she told ""Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die
because of their torture and painless beat"". Then I have decided to go for
police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We
have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then
police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against
them so that they can feel guilty about their did.

Made me think of pretty much any big ""alpha"" male movie character or star. James Bond. Bruce Wayne. All the Pacino, Eastwood, Cruise, Hardy, Bale, Pitt, and a couple of DiCaprio and Gosling characters. Their characters are typically men of few words. Confident. Stoic. Smooth. Stylish. Guys like these can probably have any girl they want, but there is a common trope in movies that they will try to win over the girl who was initially cold to them. James Bond is actually the perfect example now that I think about it. Has less to do with the girl (or guy) itself and more to do with the ""chase"" of winning him or her over. I think another difference is that with girls there's a trope of them wanting to ""fix broken men"" that may be connected to the trope of ""girls like jerks"" but honestly idk. 

However, I think a key point is that most movies and media are usually not a good demonstration of how relationships work irl at all. But there's a distinction to be made. The trope isn't that guys and girls are into people that treat them like shit. The trope is that guy and girls are into people that give them the cold shoulder. Does this make someone a ""jerk""? Not really. 

I've definitely known guys who have straight up told me that they initially treat high-self esteem girls like shit to get them to sleep with them and it actually works. But there's a high level of confidence and nuance people need to pull shit like this off. Albeit, guys like this go through relationships like professors go through dry erase markers so this really isn't the best way to go about finding a meaningful and healthy relationship. 

But yeah, now that you mention it I do see how it works both ways.",0

6093,6094,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

""Men dont dress for women to find them attractive. They dress so other men do not hurt them.""
I take issue with this for a couple reasons. 

1. Men absolutely do dress and behave in a way they think will attract women. Currently, most women are not willing to date gender non-conforming men, and that will have to change in order for straight men to be willing to stray from gender norms.

2. Women are just as capable of hurting people as men are, and women are just as active in policing male gender norms as men are.",0

The reason I know that the people who push this idea are ""blind"" or really, inexperienced or just don't know what they're talking about, is because for most of these people, if they have a girlfriend and she's friends with this cool guy and she always hangs out with him, they recognize the possibility that she could cheat on them with him.

But why would you think that she could cheat if befriending a girl supposedly keeps a guy stuck in the friendzone?

Or do the ""rules"" somehow not apply to that guy but they do to you? 

Friendship doesn't put you in the friendzone. 

The friendzone comes as a consolation prize from a girl who rejects your sexual advances and it is also sometimes a way for the occasional girl who has issues to manipulate and take advantage of a guy.

Its not your friendliness that puts you in the friendzone. Its the lack of a girl's attraction for you that does.

You can be that cool guy that all the girls want. Don't listen to blind people who project their own insecurities onto you.

honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments

belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia

While I don't advocate snooping around emails and social media to dig up possible dirt I will say he did the right thing by confronting her and kicking her to the curb. 

However in his post someone dropped a comment titled ""Be like Pete"" and I clicked it. It took me to an archived post from 2016 on the Relationships sub in which a woman had posted that she got dumped for suggesting to her then BF that she was going to visit in an Ex in another country.

**Lessons learned:**  

\-Have abundance Mentality: Pete gave no fucks. He knew he could find another chick and didn't care about spending the last 6 months with her. It's easy to drop a girl for bad behavior if you have an abundance mindset aka the confidence in knowing you can easily find more woman. A beta in scarcity mindset would convince himself to keep a bad woman around for fear of being alone.

\-Never keep a woman in your life who would even suggest visiting an Ex. It's a huge red flag but she also tried to spin it on him saying he was abusive for not thinking she should do it.  

\-Men don't want to be friends with good looking women. She honestly thought her ex was just platonic and yet the moment she told him she got dumped he said ""great now we can bang."" (Paraphrasing that)

3856,3857,"Musings on a MSM's journey towards masculinity.Me: 26 years old, teacher, living in a big but not huge city.

I am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity.

I was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth.

I had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago.

Beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men.

I began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily.

Of course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted.

A turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time.

I came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned:

\- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness.

\- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity.

\- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with.

\- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles.

\- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood.

\- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood.

\- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women.

\- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc.

\- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities.

\- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc.

\- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice.

\- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play.

\- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina.

\- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again. There is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man (or vice versa), buy a house together and pretend to be man, wife, and kids et al., nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we 'love' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us.

\- Masculinity isn't necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys, making lots of money, and being muscular, though for many it is, and will be. Masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible.",0

It not the case for females and maybe the reason is actually the process.   

It can take up too two weeks, you can be unable to do normal activity for up to a week after wards and that is all with no complications. 

My question was knowing that the amount of research put into freezing eggs is rather low compared to the research into freezing sperm [i mean compare the process and just how hard getting samples would be.  With eggs being so much harder to obtain less people donate to science plus you get much less at once per person] should instead of focusing on using the current method, should more research money be spent on a safer way to induce ovulation and for removal instead of focusing so much on raising the egg survival rate? 

Edit: sorry if this is a confusing mess I am not the best at writing out what I am thinking.

The question is in short: due to the risky nature of the current process to indue ovulation for freezing eggs, would it make more sense to spend the research money on a safer way to induce ovulation instead of just on how to raise the success/survival rate of frozen eggs since a safer [and hopefully much cheaper] process would make it more accessible to more woman.  And more accessibility would equal more control over when and were you want kids and the ability too still have them later in life.


I also could be completely wrong not being a doctor or any kind of expert on female biology [ex I am not female]",0

she gets back to back job from him, she started attracting kangana with that
negative intention . we the public not that fooled, we can see all how it
started, when it started and why it started. if kangana have accepted to do
movies with anurag, then taapsee wouldn't have got her got father and wouldn't
be that big month to attract kangana. kangana rejection has benefit to taapsee
so, she should be thankful to her rather attracting by saying she needs double
filter, which tapsee has started by the way..  
  
  
she felt kind of secured when anurag gave her a job back to back, and she felt
why not i took that opportunity to attract kangana so, that movie mafia gang
will be delighted and get job form them , which every actress wishes for. just
being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in
karan's good book list. by attracting kangana is the fastest way to get a job
from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure
hearted. so, taapsee use that tool intentionally. that is her strategy or plan
to get role from them.  
  
  
  
honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments
deals, but they never put outsider heroine on the top cuz that position only
belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia

2094,2095,"Withdrawing A Guilty Plea Before Sentencing?Please excuse if this question has been answered before. I am new to reddit and don't have much time to help my friend who I believe has been pressured into pleading guilty to a crime he does not believe himself guilty of. I will refer to him as David here, however this of course is not his real name and I will not provide any identifying details even if asked.

David is considering trying to withdraw his guilty plea, for the following reasons:

What happened:

1. Five minutes before his plea was due, whilst at the court, he was told the prosecution had completely rewritten the description of the charges against him, to which he claims to be innocent of and has much proof of.
2. He was told by his solicitor he 'will' be found guilty of the new charge by a jury because they will all hate him and ignore his evidence.
3. He was told he will not get 1/3 off his sentence if he does not admit his guilt right there and then. He was told it would be expensive to defend himself and that pleading guilty will save everyone a lot of money.
4. He argued with his solicitor that it did not feel right but minutes later they were called to the court room.
5. As he walked to the courtroom with his solicitor he was told again he should say guilty when asked.
6. Just before he was asked to plea the judge offered an adjournment of a few days to allow defence to consider the rewritten charge, however his solicitor declined the offer without consulting my friend at all.
7. During the plea itself the defence solicitor mouthed plead guilty multiple times at my friend as he hesitated.
8. The rewritten charge arbitrarily changed the period of the offence from a couple of months, to a whole year and included additional un-provable claims not stated before.
9. Later he was told that he could put in a basis of plea setting out his version of events and disputing certain accusations that form the charge. The basis of plea was then submitted but the CPS is saying they will not accept it because it was not agreed at the time of the plea hearing.

In addition to the above, David is suffering from chronic depression, officially homeless, often suicidal and very, very vulnerable at this time. As a result, he is very easily influenced and due to the nature of the charges, finds if very hard to argue his innocence without people saying he sounds more guilty by doing so, or he is minimising the offence.

IANAL but from my understanding of both the evidence and his explanations. I do not believe him guilty of this crime, although I admit I may be biased and it is a complicated case. He is in a really terrible place at the moment and I want to help him as best I can before what I believe is a miscarriage of justice occurs.

Please could someone advise how he might go about asking to withdraw his plea, if this is even possible given the circumstances. His own solicitor has threatened to resign from the case if my friend tries to change his plea now, leaving him undefended with very little time to act before his sentencing.",0

years back i was an ceo of an company i build from scrap,i bought my first car
and brand new suv from showroom,i had plans to expand my business to india
from middle east so that i can contribute towards the job market of my country
an advice i kept in my mind from an cousin of an friend i met in qatar when i
was in just 8th grade, i was proud of myself ,my parents were proud of me ,my
relatives were proud of me ,i used to feel the respect people used to give me
whenever i entered somewhere i was just 32 years ,but evere since this bloody
fake cases started against me i lost one by one everything , wasn't able to
move forward lost opportunities due to these bloody court dates,people started
using the opportunity to loot me knowingly i didn't want to fight with then
because i was already fighting an unwanted battle back in indian courts ,from
500k income per month to bankruptcy is what i am facing today,i am already ill
my energy is half of what i used to have before back on those days when i
started my business for first time i used to work till 2 am or sometimes till
3 am and sleep just for 3 to 4 hrs a days today i can't strain that much
because i am already stressed out in my life due to the courts and hearing i
get tired soon ,i have proof for everything each and every punctuation marks
in the petitioners petition is lie i even have video and audio proofs to prove
my innocence,rti reports to prove forged documents were filed with the help of
cops to frame me in false cases ,but when will i get the opportunity to prove
it all false? only when the bloody trial starts until then i am guilty ,
""innocent until proven guilty "" is an joke in our judiciary when it comes to
gender biased law's the judge's, cops etc somehow love to torture innocent men
and the worst thing is i have to fight the bloody feminist organizations too,
members for these organizations are torturing my family members also ,they are
threatening ,they even threathened my wife before my marriage knowing my
tragic life she stood for me and didn't dump me she was threatened by an lady
from some feminist organizations for marrying me she was even insulted at her
college because these ladies called and told all lies to her lectures she
discontinued her studies then ,is this women empowerment?,today i lost
everything my mom is more ill now ,my dad is always sad and became weak ,my
sister is sad ?,i can't face people because of my failure ,i am planning to
sell my car for hanging on somehow ,no chances for even an good job because of
the bloody criminal case against me i knwo i will win the case in the end but
then what use ? will i get all these years back ? will i get my life back?will
i get my youth back?what justice is this fight against false case for years
and in the end prove ur innocence but loose everything you had ,why ain't
courts punishing these women who file false cases in the end it's just aquital
if we prove our innocence but no punishment for the woman who ruined our life
by exploiting the law?.",0

I borrowed a kickr from another rower and got a Zwift subscription. That kept me in shape and was very easy to do with one arm. Rowing with one arm just seems like a frustrating waste of time. I doubt youll get much out of it and a bike trainer will let you focus on cardio and leg watts without being distracted by holding on to a handle that wasnt designed for one sided use. 

My biggest bit of advice is to keep one sling for your arm while exercising and wear another one normally. Youll get very sweaty so its good to have one sling designated for workout duty. I used the jiffy sling they gave me at the ER when I was on the trainer so I wouldnt get my surgery recovery sling gross.",0
4557,4558,"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 05, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

4688,4689,"The 80/20 concept is inherently flawed, based on data that doesn't represent the population, and selectively ignores parts of that data that make men look bad.I'm a guy. I like a lot of what TRP has to offer. It helped put words to things I had felt and experienced for a long time. But it's very clear that certain pieces of TRP wisdom have spent far too long in the echo chamber and become dogmatized and mythologized beyond all rational sense as a result.

The 80/20 concept is a prime example of this. I often see it referred to as the 80/20 ""rule,"" and see guys use it to show that 20% of all men are Chads running a harem.

The 80/20 rule is, so far as I can tell, based of a combination of a misappropriated Pareto principle and some very selective data pulled from [Tinder](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) and [OkCupid](https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/).

The most glaring issue with treating 80/20 as a rule for romantic interaction generally is that the data isn't based on the general population - it's based on data extracted from two very specific dating sites. The best you can say is that it applies on Tinder and OkCupid. That does not therefore mean it applies to the general population. A small percentage of the population use these apps. They are a product. They attract a certain kind of person, often for a specific purpose. Tinder dynamics =/= dating dynamics.

The Tinder study is so flawed it's hardly worth looking at. It's based off the self-reported data of 27 women. 27. Millions of women on the app, and only 27 were interviewed. So beyond not being representative of the general population, that study isn't even representative of Tinder.

The OkCupid data is a bit more solid. What does it show? Well there are a few things to note:

Yes, it appears women on OkCupid are pretty brutal in regards to how they rate the attractiveness of males. 80% of men on OkCupid were rated as below ""medium"" attractiveness. But again, this isn't an analysis of dating in general - this is an analysis of how women on OkCupid rate men on OkCupid. It's possible that women on OkCupid are just pickier about looks compared to the general population. It's possible men on OkCupid are just uglier than the general population. It's possible they just aren't good at dressing, grooming, and taking good profile pictures (and having looked over the shoulder of female friends as they swiped, I can confirm there's a lot of dudes who probably look pretty decent but absolutely suck as presenting themselves well). 20% of men were rated as above average. I've often seen this ""study"" used to confirm that 20% of men ""get"" 80% of the women. That's nonsense. And here's why:

What TRP conveniently omits from this analysis is that while the women were pretty brutal in terms of who they rated as physically attractive, women also largely went on to initiate contact with that same block of men they just rated as physically below average. Look at the graph. In terms of who women are actually willing to pursue they basically the opposite of picky in regards to looks. Arguably this is evidence that women are *not* particularly shallow - they have high standards when it comes to looks, but other things in a guys profile - humor, career, charisma, hobbies - prompt them to contact these men.

What about guys (*on OkCupid)*? Well we're much more fair about attractiveness ratings. It's a nice bell curve peaking right around ""medium,"" although I have to imagine the thought process here went something like ""mm... boobs... hot..."" But who do guys (*on OkCupid)* contact? That same study that ""proves"" 80/20 found that two thirds of all male attention is focused on the top one third of women. So why isn't there a 66/33 rule? Well because that would make men look like shallow horndogs drooling after only the hottest of the hottest women who are way out of their league and then complaining when they strike out. It would make men look bad. So TRP ignores it, rather than codifying it as a rule for all human interaction the same way they did with the data on women. Well that's not quite correct - they only did this with the data that makes women look bad. The part that shows that women happily initiate contact with far more than just the top 20% conveniently gets omitted from this ""rule.""

Finally, just on a common sense level, one fifth of all men are not Chads. Think of any time you've seen a pretty random subset of the population, have *one in five* of the men present been jacked, jawlined, charismatic pussy-slayers? No. Not even close. Probably more like 1-2%. And do these men get a lot of sex? Yes. Do they probably get sex from the hottest women? Yes. Does this mean there's no sex available for everyone else? Not even close. A majority of men report having multiple sexual partners over the course of their lives - the 0-1 category is a minority and, considering that many religious people who weren't trying to get laid before marriage are in the 1 category, it's probably even smaller. Only between 12-14 percent of adults aged 20-24 have never had sex. This number drops to around five percent for adults aged 25-29, and by age 44, only around 0.3 percent of adults report never having sex. So if your goal is to be able to effortlessly hook up with different hotties five times a week, yeah, sorry, you're shit out of luck. That's only something Chad (or a very very rich guy) gets to do. But you don't need to be a Chad or in the top 20% of men looks-wise to have a normal, happy, healthy sex life, or even to get laid quite a bit.

3133,3134,"One thing you have to know is that there is a fundamental flaw in this question - ""What do women want?""

The flaw is this -- Every single man who ever asked this question is operating in a woman's frame, with her as the goddess whom he's trying to learn to please. And as we know, women don't have much of a frame at all. That is the source of the confusion. 

As for the much more useful question ""Who am I, the man?"", it never occurs to the average man to ask himself that, let alone answer it. His self awareness is limited to the knowledge that he's got a dick that has begun to work for more than just pissing, that his heart rate is a little higher and maybe his navel's tingling. I doubt if the thought even arose that yes, he is indeed a man... 

Which doesn't help him have a frame of a man in the least, let alone a life worthy of a man. 

It takes men a long way down the road to realize that even if they are doing everything else right, they are still not operating in their frame yet, but trying to find hers. That is more subtle stuff, not as easy to spot as skin and bones or a pot belly, or that you don't even know how to talk to a girl -- but it's the root of the problem. It takes even more experience to learn all the ways in which we're still subconsciously doing it. 

If you have properly gone through the trp factory, when you come out the other end, you should have an honest answer to ""Who am I as a man?"" and ""What kind of woman do I want? ""

And even then, growth and learning never end even for the best of us. We just learn to find out own way and make our own contribution from there.",0

If youre like 95% of dudes, you either dont know or dont give a fuck about style. You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go.

You wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else.

For a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else.

And if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you.

You wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them.

You never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you.

Thats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style.

&#x200B;

A High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him.

Why?

Because his style is a visual representation of who he is.

**It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.***

&#x200B;

Your style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier  easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet.

Its a value add on on every level.

People will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it.

*""It is both delusional and stupid to think that clothes don't really matter and we should all wear whatever we want. Most people don't take clothing seriously enough, but whether we should or not, clothes do talk to us and we make decisions based on people's appearances.""*

# Developing Your Style

&#x200B;

*Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.*

** Epictetus**

&#x200B;

Developing your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition  it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort.

The same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life.

And yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.*

Thats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think  fuck that dude looks good.

I cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style.

But there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process;

 

# Fit is King

It doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is  be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear  fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.***

You see it all the time  fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance.

None of this shit works.

So learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration  thats half the work done.

 

# Stick to the Classics

&#x200B;

*""I live for myself and I answer to nobody.""*

*** Steve McQueen***

You dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented  all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.*

[Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years.

If you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it  he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits.

Theres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish  all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen.

 

# Keep it Simple

*Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.*

Classic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics:

&#x200B;

***Colour.***

Your colour friends are  [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589)  black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown.

Thats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match.

&#x200B;

***Less is more***

&#x200B;

*All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret  the simpler the better.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

The 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of.

*You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.*

So learn to choose carefully  or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch.

# Steal from Your Icons

*One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.*

** Cary Grant**

&#x200B;

If you look at any famous creative people  musicians, artists, designers, film makers  none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.

Developing your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them. Then tweak it & develop it until it becomes your own. Its that simple.

# Show Me the Money

*It is totally impossible to be well-dressed in cheap shoes.*

** Hardy Amies**

&#x200B;

Why spend 100 bucks on a [polo shirt](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/embroidered-cuban-collar-polo-shirt-mens-vega-in-ecru-cream/?category_id=1111&gaEeList=M%20-%20Tops) when you can get 8 for that price? Well, the answer is easy  for 100 bucks, you get quality in terms of design, materials and fit that will last. For 12 bucks, you get a [poorly fitting polo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Lavendar-XX-Large/dp/B07N4P9DS6/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=polo+shirt&qid=1585770945&sr=8-8) made from low grade materials that looks like it cost 12 bucks and - after a few washes - is worthless. One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you.

The difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1). These are two areas where you simply cannot skimp on. [Cheap shoes](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) kill any outfit stone dead.

Theres a reason why you pay more for leather, wool and cotton - its practically impossible to look good in man made synthetic materials like polyester, pleather and acrylic.

If you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear.

&#x200B;

**Shop online**

A retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need  good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why.

Youre also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain.

So shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe  youll never wear it.

&#x200B;

**Never Go Full Retail**

All designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack  wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites.

Other places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail.

The key difference is the odd feminists may say yeah we oppose consrciption, and if it does exists we should make it both sexes... knowing full well it wont happen and they wont campaign for it.... when it does happen ....

There are circumstances where I can imagine the word 'slut' being used either between consenting adults into dirty talk, or even as a self-identifier used with pride. I can't imagine 'thot' being used in any such way, because its always about that girl over there whose a whore. I find something deeply offensive in the idea that you're better than a woman, because she's had sex, or more likely, feels any sort of ownership in her own sexuality.

This tries directly into it being related to this fragile, bullshit macho attitude. There's a distinct component to toxic masculinity that is the idea that a man is inherently superior to a woman, and should have the pick of the litter for some idiot ideal of pure virgin waifu who's never so much as conceived of a dick and is outright terrified of masculine power.  Thot is an extension of this, a declaration of being above a woman who simply isn't some submissive, terrified maiden.

I personally don't know if welfare for men is the answer. But we already have a billion dollars a year in VAWA funding for organizations that care almost exclusively for women despite literally decades of peer reviewed research showing the full picture of DV.

So Ive been off of the TRP subs for close to a year now, as I spent most of 2018 reading, absorbing, and learning as much as possible. The last year was spent applying what Ive learned. 

No shocker here, but the results have been great. Success with women has been awesome, Ive built my own business, improved my physique and also replenished my finances.

Lately though Ive been feeling some anxiety and low level depression seep back in, so Ive restarted my therapy appointments.

With the TRP principles internalized, its hard for me to not speak about certain subjects and it comes out through a TRP perspective.

I can already tell that my (female) therapist thinks Im sexist or misogynistc. Pretty much any of the females in my life come to a similar conclusion and think Im an asshole, or evil.

Im not an autist with what Ive learned. I dont openly talk about TRP concepts or shove it in anyones face. But Ive internalized enough of it now to the point of its just who I am for the most part.

I dont try to manipulate anyone, make them feel like shit, or harm anyone. I try to be an all around good person, but yet Im still hearing these comments and seeing disgusting faces at my beliefs.

Im suicidal because im a disgusting dirty and gross whore. Im only aroused sexually by beautiful men. No matter where I talk about this I get banned or silenced because its that pathetic and gross. My last post got removed by a moderator and I was told I didnt seem suicidal enough. Im a cutter and i one time have to have 100 stitches at the hospital in my left arm. For anyone who doesnt think im suicidal enough or serious i have razors i can take pictures of to prove that i am. You are welcome to message me about it.

For context here's a bit about why ive been getting banned:

I've been reading a lot on reddit about dating & attraction lately. A lot of men keep telling me that most women are able to be aroused by ugly men so long as those men say & do the right things. I am not this way though. I just like beauty. My question is: is this how most women are?

Ive been trying to talk about this on various subreddits and getting banned.

The first subreddit I tried talking about my love of beauty on was [r/cuckoldpsychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/cuckoldpsychology/) and got banned.

Then I tried posting about it on [r/purplepilldebate](https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/) and also got banned.

When asked why I was banned they cited a comment of mine where I'm talking about good looks being a key component to attraction. I got banned for it then muted when trying to talk about it with mods. Do mods hate female sexuality??? Here's my conversation with the mods, as well as the comment that I made: [https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f](https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f)

So that brings me to my question: **are most women like me and they get aroused by beauty?**

I always just considered this a part of my sexuality? Is it wrong or dirty?

# &

Do women hate other women for their sexuality? I ask because I got banned from [r/askwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/) for asking about my sexuality & *if it was normal for women to love beauty*. I was told that it was not an appropriate question. When I asked if it was appropriate to talk about sex I was muted.

Yes, physically they have differences, like men tend to be taller and larger etc. But psychologically (Im not an expert so I could be wrong) there dont seem to be a huge amount of big differences. The idea that men are more logical and less emotional is lost on me, because I am a very emotional person, and so is my father. My mother on the other hand is logical and very unemotional.

You're breastfeeding and running a household, that's an enormous amount of work and it's a 24/7 job. Feeling like you're a failure or losing yourself is normal, it happens to us all but it's not a part of motherhood that's openly discussed. I do worry about you mentioning frequent breakdowns. Have you been screened for post partum depression or anxiety? Your OBGYN should be able to help. 

For practical advice, find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. I mean for everything. Make a couple of hours a week after the baby is in bed for you and your husband. Take some you time. Even if its getting up fifteen minutes earlier to enjoy a cup of coffee alone. Those alone minutes can be the difference between staying calm and losing your shit entirely. If you're able, hire a babysitter one night a month for a date with hubby. Remember it's okay to ask for help. I waited until my youngest was three to hire a nanny and she's a godsend. Her creativity and input is well worth every penny I've spent and she's become an invaluable part of our family. 

And finally, this to shall pass. All of the struggles you have are temporary and you'll be okay. Your baby will be okay if you're not perfect and so will hubby. Don't compare yourself to other moms or families. You're doing great.

look up the current situation of eu right now. it's simple, men live by logic

wars and many more things.

indoctrinated with this bullshit, as i heard this from my six yr old niece.
there are some mentally crack people which need to be controlled and because
of this, the laws are formulated, implementation of those laws is a separate

3623,3624,"The impact of a man's past on him is very different from the impact of a woman's past on her - and the difference can be day and night when the man has the tools to deal with his past.**TL : DR - What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger, once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman damages and enslaves her for life, with recovery a rare exception.**

**We're specifically talking about past experiences here.**

As tomes of RP posts and reports coming from direct experience would have told you by know, a woman's past does matter a lot. Even a guy like Roosh who had sex with hundreds of women when he retired admitted he'd only want women with zero or low n counts. A man who is sexually very successful is seen as extra attractive despite his reputation while a woman who is too loose is slut shamed or considered washed up especially after she's spent her prime years riding the CC. On Tinder it couldn't be more blatant that 80-90% of the women want to fuck the top 10% of men. A man who fails sexually is an object of ridicule by both women and other men while a woman who saves her body for the best man / men is appreciated for her taste. Instinctively our standards for men and women are opposites. 

While a feminine dominant society tries to shame men for taking her past into consideration, and shames men for the expectation of wanting either virgins or women with a low n count, while simultaneously encouraging her to be ""sexually liberated"", make ""her choice"" and on top of that later down the road, tries to convince a man that she has ""matured"" or is ""over it"" or ""now knows what she wants"" (lol the irony), we observe the actual scenario and know far better what's really up. Of course, there is always a set of women especially in more conservative countries who are 1-2 generations behind the current state of the West to try to play the ""I want a virgin too or a good man with a low n count card"" in the name of ""equal logic and equal standards"".

Whatever the strategy used by different societies, discussions of one's past bring up fierce debates on unfairness and equality. However life doesn't run on machine logic.

A man's past is a problem for him when it injures him deeply - either physically, or emotionally or mentally, and when he has neither the tools nor the awareness nor the frame to deal with it. If he doesn't find the tools, the results can be catastrophic. One only needs to look at what kind of shit men can land up into - violent crime, abusive relationships, suicides, drugs, alcohol -- and every one of this is due to past trauma that never found space and consciousness to heal.

To add to the challenge, men often do not have support systems, those whom he needs in his low moments ditch him for the good times and he is ridiculed for trying to seek help. Man is ridiculed for even saying he has a problem. Even in effective support systems meant to help him, he has to face at least 50 people all calling him a faggot for every mistake and has to earn his respect (MRP, I'm looking at you...and respect you). A man learns soon that there is no substitute for strength and being proactive.

Let's make the exception for lasting physical trauma. Soldiers who come back with PTSD and worse from wars have often been found to have suffered lasting brain injuries and lesions, which are responsible for the symptoms. Some people with an altered personality have been known to have had a brain tumor in a particular part of their brain. So, physical damage is the one thing a man might totally not recover from. But that hasn't stopped them from trying.

But when a man does have the tools and cultivates some awareness and frame, the mental and emotional scars can soon be overcome, and except severe injuries that caused permanent damage to the body, many injuries and diseases can also be fixed medically today. Everyone who has ever contributed to RP awareness has shared their own tools from their toolbox for this purpose (for those who ask). I too found some really powerful tools for me, which I have shared.

Once a man has somehow found the space he needs to make even a little peace with his past, his problem solving mind gets to work, learning lessons from the experience, developing a new mindset and approach, looking at what went wrong and how to improve his results. Recognizing that there is no support granted to him, but the need must still be addressed nevertheless, a man decides to create what is missing in life himself, walking the hard path. It is a long an arduous road to create what has not existed before.

If needed, man seeks out discomfort in planned doses, gains additional experiences, works on himself and gets better and better every time with each additional experience, every failure and success until he masters the challenges that once seemed impossible to him. As every rep he does stimulates more muscle to grow afterward, men simply improve with experience. Men use their past to attain mastery in the present. Man essentially runs on the paradigm **""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger""**. Of course let's be practical and add this line - **""Once he recovers from it. ""**

This is also and especially true for sex. A man who has embraced his sexuality gets better at the game with every experience.

A man once awakened, doesn't mind systematically annihilating his past dysfunctional self to become a more evolved being.

A bad past however has a much worse impact on a woman, given her much greater sensitivity. It creates a self perpetuating trauma pattern in her that keeps her locked in it. If her past was abusive, expect her to have a much greater tendency to pair up with the abusive assholes and suffer all her life, even if it means her children suffer at times. 10 minutes of sex god and she is alpha widowed for life and can't enjoy sex that way with other men again. 10 years of riding the cock carousel before settling down with a nice provider means it's only a matter of time before she gets bored with marriage and aspires for the thrill of the chase again  -- once unstable relationships, always unstable relationships. Or if she gets violated against her will, she can feel horrible, ashamed, dirty, even defiled and this can make it impossible for her to let go and enjoy herself with a future lover. There is no end to those complications and all the forms past unresolved emotions can take. 

**In matters involving any significant intensity of emotion, a woman essentially becomes the victim of her past pleasure and pain.**

Bitter experiences can force women to wear the pants, man up and step up to the challenges, especially if her mama mode is activated. But these usually leave her still scarred bitterly at the emotional level. A woman who has to wear the pants in the house invariably develops contempt for the man who doesn't. Behind every feminist champion, you can always find a woman emotionally scarred to some degree or the other.  Tough women especially carry boat loads of unresolved emotional pain. There are many such women who have manned up only to lose faith in men and carry bitterness and contempt towards men for not having the manliness that a woman was capable of summoning. 

Unresolved past sexual trauma can subconsciously force a woman to make herself unattractive and unhealthy, which is what we see in many feminists, as a way to avoid the possibility of a repeat of that experience and getting hurt again. By comparison, men who are hurt try to avoid relationships. 

The tendency of the feminine ego to seek refuge in the feeling of victim hood does not help in this - it helps keep her past alive in her. A bad past just gives the victim tendency a first class ticket.

The fact that women tend to be a herd animal with a significant collective hive mind component to their existence makes it worse. In one room, all that one woman has to do is to bring out her past emotions and you can be sure that within minutes, even seconds, that all the women are feeling the same thing. The impact of past experiences on a woman is simply deeper and bigger already due to their sensitive nature, and it only gets multiplied further by the collective pain body of the feminine.

We even see this any time she's in a bad mood -- they remember past miseries and mistakes in excruciating detail don't they? Not all of a woman's pain or emotion is hers alone, it's the pain and emotion of womankind.

Let's not even get started on bad habits. Women who get into drinking and drug abuse wreck their lives and the lives of their families and children in spectacularly horrible ways. And once it starts it becomes near impossible for them to stop. I see a lot of men in mrp in the OYS threads working on their addictions from alcohol to the smartphone and porn, but I don't get to see many woman come out of deep shit by themselves. They'll need help, if they are capable of being helped at that point that is.

While a man can get to enjoy the feeling of mastery at the end of his struggles and suffering and victory, a woman is still left with a bitter taste in her psyche and lots of unresolved pain even if she ends up succeeding. Even success doesn't seem to fill up a woman's emotional holes - you can see this with any successful woman who had to wear the pants to get there. There is some unhappiness in their tone, as though they regret the impact it had on their femininity. 

As for a history of crazy sexual behaviour, when I see the stories of many of these women, with notch counts that would have been impossible without contraception, their troubling past prior to that, along all the thoughts and emotions that these women admit to having over time swinging across the entire spectrum, and add the impact of powerful sexual memory on their system, all I can say is that it's a case of absolutely fucked up, both inside and out. The fuck up outside just reflects the fuck up on the inside, and makes it worse. The biggest mistake is to assume and believe what they say as if the impact of such powerful emotions and experiences can simply be wished away by rationalization. 

A lifetime spent running full throttle in one direction will never magically fix itself overnight. 

As I wrote in my post on the irony of ""Choice"", it is stupid to think you are choosing when your mind has this much grip over you. These women may claim they are over it, but deep down their minds are still in the same deep turmoil of thoughts and emotions as ever and they have never addressed that. That software runs freely on the inside, just hidden. That won't stay quiet for long. Sooner or later their unhappy selves are going to emerge for the next round of seeking salvation elsewhere, or they are going to go crazy. 

And that's why you should never listen to their claims that they've overcome their past. That as you will read below, requires exceptional work, the honesty to face oneself and take responsibility for once, and they should have clearly done it and have results to show for it. You cannot practice instability all your life and then hope to stay stable and committed one fine day. How in the world did men start believing that shit and even white knighting for it by any logic is beyond me.

So for all but the most spiritual of women, a woman essentially runs on the paradigm of being a victim of her past -- **""What doesn't kill her enslaves her"". Recovery? Oh God...**

Why I said all but the most spiritual women was that there are some women who do find tools to work on themselves, a few do end up recovering from their past experiences, but if you've ever read some of the books written by them on the subject, you can tell that the recovery process is a battle, involving massive emotional releases, moments of very altered moods and the like - it's like 4th of July. The key difficulty is that women being more emotional, find the way of awareness and inner peace inherently more difficult, and have a lot of extra pain to resolve. Usually devotion, service, nurturing others and emotional methods work much easier with them (which is why more women than men go seek religion). But it is not impossible, and the tools can also work extremely well with them.

In fact most of the tools will work on anyone who is serious about using them.

Trouble is, many of these women are too deep into the grip of their own past patterns to get to the start line even. It takes women years of work to get to a point where a lot of their traumatic patterns are dissolved and we're back on a clean slate, though by then, they might not even be physically in their prime. Biologically women have a shorter prime than men to bear healthy children and then be healthy enough to raise them to adulthood. Men on the other hand, can keep their physical and reproductive prime up for longer.

The task of ""annihilating their past unhappy self"" is therefore much harder for a woman and needs more work. A man would find it easier to help himself or recruit help where he doesn't find help by default, but women really do need far more hand holding when dealing with deep inner pain. Sometimes absolute dominance is probably the only way to force them to start to work on themselves.

Biologically a woman who has a bad past or a history of bad habits, or even a very stressed history has a much greater chance of hurting the physical and mental health of an unborn child. In old school societies, lots of care is taken to see to it that pregnant women are kept emotionally ""well fed"". Just a history of lots of stresses, irregular hours of food, diet and rest can damage their fertility and reproductive health. No one mentions the impact of abortions and contraception on reproductive health and hormonal balance. A woman's body is a significant biological investment, and men are biologically wired to be repelled by women with a history of destructive habits and behavior.

Do keep in mind though that a man's bad habits like smoking and drinking and sedentary living also damage his reproductive health and T levels, but again, good habits, lifting and diet can go a long long way to correcting this. Fitness also has equally positive effects on a woman's health, but most unhealthy women I tell you also come with a significant degree of mental and emotional illness and are too far in a hell hole to even turn up at the gym. **Most women who are unhealthy today are actually so because of an underlying emotional or mental problem, while most men are just plain lazy**. In my world, women will have to lift, do yogic practices and meditate. For their own good. I won't accept those not willing.

Amidst all this, anything a woman gains in technical skill from her sexual experiences can easily become irrelevant. Besides, a skilled man can always train a willing woman (go to mrp and see that latest post), leaving her free to concentrate on the seduction part of her game.

I honestly feel sadness and pity for many of these women whom I see, broken wrecks of what could have been. I couldn't stay cold about it if it happened to any of the women in my family or life, but honestly, they're doing it to themselves and save-a-hoe is just stupid -- the foolish nice guy who wants to save them and change them just gets swept into that shit and realizes too late that this is way beyond his power to solve, and he might not even be able to get out safely from crazy. 

In the case of woman and the impact of her past on her psyche, prevention was always far better than cure. Let's be real about that. That's why old societies were always so strict with their women. 

So in the end, a man's past can end up making him stronger and wiser and he can look back at it honestly without toxic shame, with a degree of pride and gratitude even -- as a very harsh teacher, but the one he needed, that taught him permanent lessons. Women on the other hand, are often left with permanent or lasting physical and psychological damage from their pasts far more than lessons learned. Men become responsible for themselves over their past, women become victims of their past.

**And that's why a man's past and a woman's past are simply not comparable.** We're not denying that men too get damaged from their past, but unless its a serious physical injury, it is indeed easier to recover from that and emerge stronger than it is for a woman. What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman tortures her for the rest of her life. And that is how it goes for all but the most exceptional cases.

*PS : When I used the word ""past"", it wasn't in the context of reputation, but past experiences. Now about reputation -- A woman's reputation did matter enormously in societies of the past, and I myself know that my grandmother would have preferred death to shame and loss of reputation. But in a feminine primary society, the sisterhood will defend her in public, encourage her in private and bitch about her behind her back. Yes, that last part is true.*

*A man's reputation however is everything, especially in this kind of society. It is more vulnerable than the most delicate and sensitive woman, and as easy to shatter as glass, and easier to damage forever. A woman will cast allegations on you, even and especially false ones if it benefits her, her sisters will vilify you as a monster, your rival men, her orbiters, and envious betas will rush to her aid, glad to see your downfall, the white knights and SJWs will attack you, and the justice system exists for the sole purpose of screwing you forever, you'll be abused and raped in prison hell, you're out of the job market, the feminist dominated media will write any shit on you if it sells, society treats you in ways they didn't treat slaves or untouchables, and your best hope is to actually STFU and fight to the end --* ***rape of a man is the rape of his reputation and freedom.*** *Once raped, it will never recover to the way it was formerly.* *Only God alone can save you if truth is on your side TBH. So remember Law #5 always --* ***So much depends on reputation, guard it with your life!***",0

4941,4942,"How to move on and let go?Basically I'm asking for advice on how to move on and let go of this girl who has been tormenting me in my own head. She lived next door and we quickly became friends  as we had a lot in common. At the time I was very bad with girls and had no experience. I quickly developed a crush on her but had no idea to make a move. She would often flirt with me when drunk but I was oblivious and shy at the time. Fast forward I grew some balls and started talking to girls and getting with women. This led to me and her eventually hooking up. However she quickly started displaying weird behavior. She would flirt with me all night and then leave with another guy, was constantly hot and cold I thought I was buggin but her friends agreed that this was a habit of hers. I became upset with her and my neediness caused her to end things but I found out that she had lied to me about something else and ended our friendship. She begged me for forgiveness and so I forgave her.

The year after we start hooking up again but one night while we're walking home she ditches me and sleeps with my best friend who had a gf. He knew I liked and even bragged about lying to her and how bad she wanted him to me and other friends. Im beyond upset and tormented. Firstly that she would sleep with a guy like that, I usually couldn't care who she sleeps with, not that she even needs my permission but it just makes it ten times worse to think that she would sleep with a guy like that. (fast forward he did something similar to another friend months later but they were actually about to date the girl.) . Obviously this is more of a me problem why does it bother me so much that she'd sleep with a guy like this. I mean I'd understand like if the guy was actually charming but he wasn't good looking, was narcissistic and a compulsive liar. When I asked her about it she said she was really drunk and him as well, which checks out. But idk if she was drunk enough that she didn't know what she was doing.

An important part of this story is we never had sex we would always get close but she always claimed she'd feel bad bc her best friend had a huge crush on me and told her not to. Which was true. I think this made it all the more worse as he got something so easily that I had been trying so hard for. But she also had a string of toxic behavior that made me question if this was the real reasoning or if she was just manipulating me, for validation.(I could never tell although she did seem sincere when she said she did want to sleep with me). 

Logically I know this girl and friend aren't for me and I should move on from both but their both stuck in my head, its been many months now and time isn't helping. I constantly think about the two of them together. And for some strange reason I still want her, no girl has come close. I've had sex with a few more girls since but nothing is filling the gap. I want her out of my head

Seen this a few times, did that myself until I found TRP (except the marriage part). Guy who's popular and good with girls assumes that this means he's alpha and/or RP thus immune to classic ""post marriage zero sex"" or assumes he can do no wrong and goes full BP.

2. If the judge allows or agrees such a statement, then abetment to suicide is no more a crime.
3. This can be now used in a lot of cases of one persuading another to a crime. If X keeps on telling Y to kill themselves or kill somebody else and this case was brought to court, then X can easily get off by saying ""If Y can't handle the pressure, it's not my fault"".
