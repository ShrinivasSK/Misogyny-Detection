The elder scrolls may borrow historically accurate settings (each race being a historical race/empire) but they do such a good job of blending those historical connections into an original lore that you lose any grounds for historical accuracy.

840,841,"You might try reading something like Feynmans The Character of Physical Law.  I thought it gave a good introduction to various concepts without just reciting a bunch of formulas.  Have you learned any calculus?  I found I understood some things better when I looked at back after learning calculus.  Beginner physics courses often bypass needing calculus by just giving derived or integrated equations that apply in particular simplified situations, while some get a better understanding by knowing how the given equations were derived.  


Some people also do better when they start thinking about how those concepts apply in day to day life, and are able to get some sense of scale.  This is particularly an issue in America where you might be using USC in day to day life but SI in the classroom.  Mathematically, I can work out that a 10 kg block with an applied force of 100 N should have an acceleration of 10 ms^(-2).  Then think about something you can relate that to, 10 ms^(-2) is about how fast a dense object will fall, 10 KG is a small/medium size dog, or maybe a bag of onions sold at the grocery store, 100 N is about the weight of that dog or onions.  Highway speeds are around 28 m/s, residential areas might have a speed limit of 11 m/s, a typical walking pace is around 1.4 m/s.  Then if you get a question involving a trolley that has a speed of 2 m/s and applied force of 700 N, you can think of that 700 N being about as hard as you would be able to push something and the 2 m/s as a brisk walk to get an intuitive idea what the result should be before you put pencil to paper.  This also helps as a kind of check in that if you make a mistake in your calculation and get a result of something like the trolley weighing 2000 Kg you might notice it doesnt fit with your intuition from above.  

Then again, sometimes it comes naturally over time as you start recognizing patterns in the questions, or you start getting more complex questions and have to apply those formulas in more complex ways.  Sometimes I found my skills grow when I would forget a particular formula while doing a test and work it out from more fundamental ones.  For example, I might not have always remembered the quadratic formula but I remembered enough from reading how it was derived to apply the same process to a test question.",0

32,33,"I literally cannot imagine a scenario where I'd be watching content from this
channel, leave alone penning down a comment. I personally abhor this
propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times.
It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital
platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get
certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and
Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that
the news channels alone can provide.",0

It says:

*How do we not lose hope in finding love? How do you tell yourself that the right guy will come along when you don't really believe it? Why do you not believe that it could happen for you? Regardless of the insanity that we see out there today, love happens. People get married. People move in together. These things happen all the time. You don't have to be young, or beautiful, \[rich, famous\], in shape, enough to offer, or have a good credit score. If love happens for this one or for that one then it is possible for me. Whatever we have lived up to in our past, it does not indicate our future. You may want to revisit choices that you dismissed in the past.*

In the comments below the video, you can find an excerpt from the the despair of women over 25 (and certainly over 30):

*Im 46 years old and it has never happened for me.*

*Its really hard to believe love can happen for me when I have been waiting for so long. Its been 12 years since my divorce, and I am losing hope.*

*It has been 20 years since my divorce.  I've been with several dating agencies, and only had a couple of short - term relationships which have never lasted beyond a few weeks/months.  Just one that lasted about 15 months, but he turned out to be an alcoholic.  I've had a couple of dates just recently, but all he wanted was a friend ""with benefits"" .  I will be 70 this year so just want someone who will prove his worth before anything like that happens.  I'm not as confident about my body, as I was years ago.*

*Im a very affectionate caring loving women aged 35 , men tell me Im attractive all the time.  But I meet a guy we start to date , we get on great he says hes so crazy about me & finds me so attractive & caring and with in a few weeks( longest being 6 mths )the man says he doesnt want commitment & has no feelings for me . This has happen to me about 20 times over the past 15 years. So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it.*

*Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?*

I think that the lesson for women is quite simple.

Either they find a husband while still in their prime age, or else, they will soon end up in a desperate situation.

Of course, that does not change anything on the male side, which first and foremost may want to stay away from the gynocentric court system. So, if a woman is young and pretty, she may still be able convince a younger man, who at that point is still governed by his hormones, to ignore his red-pill lessons and sign up anyway, for a stint on the plantation. Older women are mostly toast, while the video tries to give them hope that they are not (but they do not seem to believe it, really).",0

I think the complaints only start rolling in when the struggles of being a minority or a woman are an important part of the story or when the fact that the character is a minority is emphasized in some way that bothers them. 

I really dont understand it. Maybe the Elder scrolls series is just so good that they dont mind. Any piece of media that contains a woman or minority needs to be twice as good as the average one without them in order for it not to be called propaganda.",0

I'm rewatching the wire, and on season 3 where prez shoots a black cop (again); people are telling him it could be racial, and his father-in-law police major asks prez's black commenting officer lieutenant, Daniels, if Daniels will support prez if the incident turns racial. At first I questioned that Daniels doesn't say anything or ""yes,"" as he knows prez isn't racist, but it actually makes sense Daniels doesn't give a statement there. (He also hates the guy asking him, as he's generally a dick, and Daniels has also talked to prez informally and can see the guy isn't smart with his words, and needs a lawyer)

I'm really liking Daniels' character this watch around; he does what's right, eventually, usually, though he plays the game wisely. I also really like how there's displayed racism against white people, particularly politicians like Tommy carcetti, in the show; a lot of corrupt politicians are black people who only associate with other black people too.",0

4562,4563,"**OYS #4** 

Country still has no lockdown.

Stats: age mid 30, married to wife (mid 30), 3 kids (2, 5, 7). Height 5'9"". Weight: 76 kg (167 lbs). Strong lift 5x5, B 55 kg,+5 OHP 45 kg, DL 70 kg, SQ 90 kg, ROW 50 kg.

Still reading some of the sidebar, The Book of Pook, The seduction method. WISNIFG.

**Physical/training**

Finally got the form issue sorted with BP, hope to see more chest growth coming weeks. Compiled pictures of muscle development and see continuous progress since mid feb when I started. 

Got private boxing training from a friend which was great. Hoping to do this every week.

**Marriage/How not to do MRP**

Blarg\_Risen gave good advice on previous OYS. He was also right I wasn't ready. In order to get out of wifes frame get to a better state in our communication I started acting as if wife was dead. The way I approached it trying to be as normal as possible when communication in logistical matters but neither initiate or be responsive to other social communication. First few days was I was riding high. Getting back the-world-is-my-oyster-feeling (is this abundance mentality?) I had from age 20 till I started my family. Went out and did stuff for my self and feeling good.

After a couple of days wife started with shit test which turned in to comfort test with small brake down  (crying and  asking what she can do to fix things). Me being a faggot I respond to this and basically reseting myself to BetaMax. We make out and form a overt/covert contract to fuck later that night. Come night she falls a sleep and there is no fucking. I did well with OI and no butthurt. Watch some tv and fell a sleep. Next morning I get up for a walk to clear my head and when I get back wife supposedly got ready for morning sex. I lay down but don't feel like initiating which she doesn't either. Both gets pissed.

Shit test day ensues in which I scoreboard argues (which I have been doing a lot) and she flippes out, and started with divorce threats. I start feeling beta nervous but then ""Luke use the force"" I remember my  worst case scenario-training and don't give a fuck. I go shopping for groceries while she is divorcing online on her phone. I get chirpy in the car and come back in a good mood which continues. Next day she asks for forgiveness for her behavior I accept still in my IDGAF mode. After that everything is kind of good.

Failings:

\- Thinking her small brake down/comfort test ment shit

\- Breaking my social distancing (to wife lol)

\-  Fucking score board mentality (put a fucking end to that)

\- No real OI when facing denial/indifference.

Success (I think)

\- IDGAF in face of serious divorce threats.

\- Learning how to access abundance mentality (If I understand it correctly)

\- Recognizing when being in her frame and stopping it during week (need to inform, need for validation, need for approval)

\- Killing oneitis and getting more signals of dread from wife (""using free time to get in shape is like me getting a boob job paid by joint account"").

**Mental**

Even though the week had a lot of failures I learned a lot. About my weakness to emotional manipulation, how to access abundance mentality and that both wife and I now know who the prize is. Since basically no real gains have been made with wife regarding her behavior (except a lot less shit tests efter apology) the risk of dancing monkey seems little. The change I am making is more for me than her right now. Will be watchful regarding this if/when affirmation from wife comes.

**Sex**

After apology from wife we had decent sex. She was eager for me to come even though It wasn't a big deal for me (reading NMMNG). My current thinking is to lay low for a while and just focus on my mental state. I am making plans for gaming and dates later this month with focus on feeelz.   

**Family**

Continuous better relations with kids. Raised voice a couple of times but not needed so much because of increased compliance. Having a good time with all of them now which is great.

**Social**

Going great. Seen friends boxing, building stuff and made planes for walking later this week with three different friends.

**Week goals**

\- Go to gym three days (went 4 times, 2 week success)

\- No losing calm at all (2 week success)

\- No sweets or chips (birthday party fucked diet up during weekend)

**Shit owning / Goals**

\- Kill ego (def getting there, validation still issue)

\- Kill the affirmation seeking faggot (getting there, stopped a lot of faggot-attempts during week)

\- **STFU**, a lot of failings this week but at least learned a lot.

~~- Stop being afraid (of failure, of relationship/divorce etc.)~~ Successful here.

~~- Try no fap again went 6 days, didn't see any benifits as per above. Will try 10 days as an experiment.~~ Fuck it, will explore the concept of Health Mast. though.

\- Keep building my frame: Finally recognize whats it like being in my frame and in the same time clamping down on being in her frame.

~~- Stop being a lazy bastard by asking wife about issues. Just figure shit out.~~ (Continued gains, want to cement this as the new normal.)

\- Go back to being the charming lover boy my wife fell in love with. (getting there)

**Mission**

*Not only star in the exciting film of life but direct it as well and make people want to co-cast.*

\- Get ripped and then settle for an appropriate BF for lifestyle.

\- Be financially independent before 60",1

and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their
demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband
and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from
Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times
police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become
innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my
sister. One day she told ""Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die
because of their torture and painless beat"". Then I have decided to go for
police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We
have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then
police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against
them so that they can feel guilty about their did.

Every time I developed a crush on a girl, I truly thought it was something I had control over, and that if I got rejected and saw her with some 6'5"" muscled-out gorilla- looking-man days later, it was because I had fucked up my presentation, that I had my chance with her but I blew it.

Then one day, after the truth had chiseled away at me long enough to finally break me, I had finally became fully blackpilled. I won't go into detail how it happened; it took forever, a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario, best saved for another post. When I took the blackpill though, it was like a tremendous weight had finally been lifted. Not only did I stop hating myself, but I was able to move on and focus on other things that actually made me happy and love myself. I no longer cared what girls or really anyone thought of me; you'll never impress everyone anyway, so why get shook-up over it?

For example, I was at the local archery range the other day, bettering my aim, when an attractive young lady walked in and took a spot near me. Now I'll admit, my natural instincts caused me to let my guard down and let her in my head. I instantly put pressure on myself to shoot really good and not mess up to impress her, which in turn of course stressed me out bad. But then I quickly came to my senses and told to myself, ""Even if I was the human version of Legolas, there's no way I could flatter her. That would only be if I was a 6'5"" muscled-out nordic chad. Hell, I could be complete shit at archery then, and she would be chomping at the bit to come over and assist me, so she could touch and adjust my arms and feel my muscles and shit.""

And just like that, I calmed down, my mental state was restored, and I was able to go back to enjoying myself and focusing on shooting.

Now I know some of you are going to say ""I wish I could have a girl adore me like that."" Or ""I'll never experience being touched romantically and sensually.""

Well, so what? Why should you care if other people don't like you? If you haven't already, you'll come to learn that 90% of the people you meet are just a bunch of miserable dick-assed weirdos who only enjoy putting others down to make themselves feel better about their own shitty ass lives. They are not worth pleasing.

Also, a lot of people won't get to experience a lot of things. Blind people will never get to see their own face. Deaf people will never get to hear their own voice. A few years ago, there was this four-year-old kid in my town who had to have all of his limbs amputated, or else this horrible genetic medical condition  would kill him. Now he will never get to experience walking, running, jumping or playing, or opening his own birthday presents or taking care of himself or anything really for the rest of his life.

My point is, yes life is terrible, yes life is filled with suffering, but that doesn't mean YOU  HAVE to be miserable every second of every day. As a human being, you are capable of many more amazing things than you realize. As a 25 y/o virgin, I have found so many amazing things to do that made me realize just how amazing I am as a person, and they don't involve having a romantic partner; some of these activities are even more enjoyable when you're alone.

Now I'm sure a lot of you are going to say that I'm just copemaxxing or something. Maybe you're right, maybe it is cope, but then again, maybe it's not. After all, some of these things, to me, like going on outdoor adventures, hunting, fishing, and hiking the AT, PCT, and CDT, feel BIGGER than just settling down with a wife and kids and becoming fully domesticated and tethered down like so many other people do. Plus, being single has it's advantages, like having a 0% chance of ruining your life by having a kid on accident.

The bottom line is, you only live once, you might as well try and enjoy life while you still have it. If the ladies don't like you, then don't sweat it. IT is right, no one is entitled to anything, especially if it involves another person. After all, no one here would like being forced to do something against their will. If girls don't pay you any mind, then fuck it! Who needs them? You can't please everyone, so don't even try. Please don't live to try and please other people, does your one-and-only life belong to those assholes, or you? Live for yourself and no one else. When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on it! Normies will say that this is not a healthy mindset, but normies have proven themselves to be full of shit with their so-called ""advice."" Hating yourself and wanting to commit violence against yourself for something you had no say in is not a healthy mindset either.

When someone takes the blackpill it shouldn't mean the end of their life, it should mark the beginning of a new one, filled with self-love and acceptance!

TL;DR: Taking the blackpill should not make you sad, it should be and indication that you are free to live for yourself. It should disarm all of your self-loathing and tell you that most people are horrible and that their opinions are worthless. Do not just LDAR. Save the LDARing for when you're dead, after you've enjoyed your life to the fullest.",0

6516,6517,"First of all - with all of our kids I was a mess for a year. I had issues with hormones and PPD coupled with not sleeping?  I was an absolute wreck.  My husband took nights on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) so I could actually sleep.  Do you absolutely have to keep pumping? Can you supplement with formula? 

You really need some self care.  There is nothing that says you never get a break just because you are a mom of a baby. In fact you really, really need a break.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  I realize theres a quarantine on and I dont know where you are - but even if you can go get a coffee and sit in the car with a book for 30 minutes.  

The thing is you have a ton of things going on here: you have an infant you is still at an age that is fully dependent on you.  You probably arent sleeping amazing. You are isolated because of a quarantine (along with the stress of that). You are essentially doing this alone (with some help from your husband).  

The infant is a full time job that never ends.  The house and being a homemaker is a full time job.  There isnt much time for leisure and building up your empty stores (you cannot pour from an empty cup).  Figure out what you need.  One day a week of sleeping in?  3 evenings where you can take a bath? Going out to get coffee? Calling a friend?  I cant answer the question for you.  But what you ARE doing isnt working.  Be specific and then tell your husband I really need sleep and I need one full night of sleep a week.  How can we make that happen? Or whatever it is that you need.  YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM FOR NEEDING THIS nor are you a bad wife.  You, my dear, are human.  

If after replenishing your stores you still dont like things that you used to enjoy - please talk to your doctor about it.  You could have Post Partum Depression.

Say Goodbye to Survival Mode by Crystal Paine

The transition into motherhood is a hard one.  I feel like as a society its supposed to be this 6 week - all the weight is gone, baby is sleeping all night.  Its okay that you arent okay right now.

Edit-cant believe I forgot this! My advice to all new moms (especially if you are struggling!) is to get outside as much as you can.  I realize it may be hard.  But if you can put baby in a stroller or a carrier and got for a short walk that can make a world of difference.  Even just sitting on the porch or a park bench can be very refreshing instead of being stuck inside all day.",0

I don't think it's something that exists universally in our world. I think there are clusters that have factors and pressures that make it worse than in other places (and vice versa, really) 

Certainly, I don't think every woman follows that sort of hypergamy path. Maybe most don't. I don't know. But I wouldn't say it's NEVER the case. Because that's obviously not true. And certainly, I've seen and heard about social pressures that actually serve to make hypergamy more expected behavior. 

I think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal. It's FAR from universal.

&#x200B;

So just a funny story. Been going through some stuff lately with all this extra face time with my partner. For the last 11 years we have been in a battle of wits because ever since taking a few classes on human sexuality in college I came to the conclusion that ""I don't want to have sex with just one person for the rest of my life"" and ever since we have just been at odds, every argument devolving into ""well if you just want other women then go"" and I would swallow my pride and try and make things up as best I could. Don't really regret any of this but in retrospect I was just hurting myself my not just ""doing what I want"" and letting the chips fall where they may. I stifled my education, felt no motivation to acquire wealth or solidify friendships. It all kept coming back to this futility between what I want and what I am ""supposed"" to want. All I wanted was to do this in the ""best"" way for both of us, wanted to be as honest as possible, and wanted to ultimately fill our life with love and social connection. She wouldn't even accept that I wanted those things, It had to be about her vulnerability in life, and everything I was saying/doing was just a means to get away and marry some other girl.... And my play was to waste my entire 20's on this?!?

Fast forward to the vids-19 and I simply couldn't keep pretending like this wasn't ruining my life. Basically a ""I love you, but I now realize that if I don't do this for myself then I won't respect myself as a man, or even as a father, and I don't want to bring crippled life into this world."" Didn't even have to say ""I'm going do it or I'm going to leave"" or any truly shitty ultimatum, just simply ""I am going to be doing this, and I respect you're decision to do what you will with that information.

Boom. Instant ""I want you to be happy, I know you really care about me etc. etc. etc. we can make this work.""

Where was this the last 10 years when I was trying to compromise and do things without being a dick? Why is this here now?

So off we go, she tells me ""I'd like to be a part of this journey with you, if you're patient with me I WANT to come along."" Go on a dating app for ethical non mono's, find a beautiful woman (whose partner wasn't a total goob) who was keenly interested in dating. All lights are green, I'm communicating with both of them and we are jiving well, I'm feeling... Good.

I start exercising more, cut crap out of my diet. It was easy! I had reason! I WANTED to be attractive again. And it felt... Great. Like a literal cloud had lifted from my vision and I could taste the vigor and optimism I had in my early 20s before it was chipped away. I started answering calls, I ""forgot"" to smoke weed from sunrise to sunset. So many things in life just started falling back into place.

When the time comes and we start a group text, everyone is talking and jiving, but I realize that my partner has only said one thing, and it's starting to feel awkward all around. When I ask her if she is having a hard time opening up, or if there is a reason she doesn't feel comfortable participating in the conversation she says... her fingers hurt too much....

Your fingers hurt?!?!? I excuse myself for a moment to try and smooth over my bubbling anger and take the time to think of the words to express my frustration, less than 3 or 4 minutes literally just took a piss. I come back and she is sleeping on the couch.

I become livid, absolutely livid (I have also been having to deal with the unemployment office on a daily basis which is incompetent as hell so my patience as a whole is way less than usual.) I tell myself I am going to have a glass of wine... literally black out after the first few sips and wake up with half a 6 pack and a pack of cigarettes with 4 missing. I was devastated, I had worked so hard to quit smoking, and had gotten my drinking under control years ago and I allowed myself to be crushed by petty squabble.

Long story short every micro step of the way she was sabotaging me, changing the rules of engagement. Generally running diversion as a means of delaying the inevitable.

Fast forward to today. In general we do our best to keep our good time ""good."" So we decide to pack a lunch and take a short 5 or so mile hike through the woods and have great conversation about our family, life goals, what we would want for our children. Just general good stuff that you look for in a good relationship. Get home, and try and tactfully inquire about some sexy time. She says something along the lines of ""its hard for me to feel sexy when your talking to other women."" so I take that for what it is, wait a while and eventually just rub one out. Not a huge deal, I've been taking care of myself for years now.

Some time later she comes up as I'm working on some Spanish lessons, asks me if I emailed her the recipe for this pizza dough I've been working on for the last 3 weeks (she knows I already did, she had it pulled up on her phone and I could see it!) I tell her that I'm pretty sure it's in her hand right now, she asks if I want to help her make it... Nah not what I'm ""wanting"" right now. She tells me she doesn't know how to use the kitchen scale... So I go and show her and carry on about my day.

Comes back up as I'm finishing my last lesson and asks, again, if I ""want"" to go pick up some cheese from the store for her... You know what, sure, I could use the air and stroll and I do love you after all.

I pop into the store, and grab 2 things instinctively. The cheese, and her favorite flowers.

As I'm walking back up the driveway the heavy shit hits... If I'm buying her these flowers because I want sex I'm just fucking myself over. I'm literally rewarding her for playing hard to get and trying to stifle my upward momentum. And out of my mouth with glee, almost as if they weren't my own words I say. ""Theses are my flowers!""

I come in hand her the cheese with flowers in hand. She is beaming, eyes welling up. ""Why did you get me flowers?"" I tell her I didn't, and that I got them because I just wanted them. I ask her, ""where do we keep the vases again?"" Plop that vase right in my officer and carry on with my day.

She literally won't stop BEGGING to give me sexual attention. But I'm good just wanked!

This is CRAZY. But it doesn't feel anymore crazy than what I was doing before placating her every-move.

Any tips to not ride this train off a cliff? I feel like I can still feel this way, and be sweet and loving and romantic, but right now I'm getting more positive attention being an asshole. I never wanted to believe that the whole ""assholes"" get girls thing was even real in any sense. Can I just like convey this to her somehow or am I best off maxing out on this new found mentality.

Others have already remarked his mistakes, but for someone so lonely and naive to man up and don't give seconds opportunities takes nuts, many blue pills would have fallen into the trap of forgiving or feeling guilty (he was guilty of putting her on a pedestal and being very naive, yes, but everything else is the fault of Hoe and Chad).",1

3636,3637,"I feel evil for living the TRP philosophyHey guys,

So Ive been off of the TRP subs for close to a year now, as I spent most of 2018 reading, absorbing, and learning as much as possible. The last year was spent applying what Ive learned. 

No shocker here, but the results have been great. Success with women has been awesome, Ive built my own business, improved my physique and also replenished my finances.

Lately though Ive been feeling some anxiety and low level depression seep back in, so Ive restarted my therapy appointments.

With the TRP principles internalized, its hard for me to not speak about certain subjects and it comes out through a TRP perspective.

I can already tell that my (female) therapist thinks Im sexist or misogynistc. Pretty much any of the females in my life come to a similar conclusion and think Im an asshole, or evil.

Im not an autist with what Ive learned. I dont openly talk about TRP concepts or shove it in anyones face. But Ive internalized enough of it now to the point of its just who I am for the most part.

I dont try to manipulate anyone, make them feel like shit, or harm anyone. I try to be an all around good person, but yet Im still hearing these comments and seeing disgusting faces at my beliefs.

6513,6514,"New Mother Needing Advice On CopingHi Red Pill Wives! I'm really in need of some advice in this very trying time of my life. Well, I don't know if I need advice, a slap in the face, a shoulder to cry on, or just to commiserate - I guess I just need some context. My husband and I have been married for a year and a half and we have a 7.5 month old son. I'm really struggling with the transition from purely homemaker to include being a stay-at-home-mom. My husband works a great job and we have always been in agreement that our ideal situation would have me staying at home looking after our children.

I feel like I'm currently not meeting my own expectations or my husband's expectations of what I should be doing at this point. The first few months were absolutely survival, we both knew that going into it, but now that we've found more of a routine with the baby I'm struggling even more now that there's more expectations of me. The idea that there's zero ""time off"" from motherhood is really eating at me in a way I hadn't anticipated.

I end up feeling slightly resentful and come off as ungrateful to my husband when his job ""ends"" and he gets a break in the evenings. He frequently works on things at home (he'll VPN onto work and check things during some evenings and on weekends) so it's not that he only works during the day and lounges for the rest. However, I get up and cover anything that our son needs between bedtime (around 7pm) and I'll get up anywhere between 6-8am and look after him for his first wake-window. Neither of us are morning people, so I find myself envying my husband who gets to stay in bed until 9 or 10. Partially for the sleep, but partially because he gets the opportunity to stay up late to enjoy his hobbies where I feel pressure to get to bed early so I'm not absolutely dead for a 6am wakeup.

We counter this problem once in a while by my husband taking the first wake-up. I'll get up and feed our son and he'll get up and spend an hour or two with him so I can get back to bed. This is usually a great treat but it's not feasible for him to do it super often and I feel a lot of guilt asking him to get up earlier on a work day or after I know he's been up late.

A lot of things I previously enjoyed as a homemaker (cleaning, cooking, general errands) don't bring me joy in the same way now that it's a juggling act with a baby. Even though I really enjoy making food for my husband, I get frustrated and anxious about getting groceries or meal planning and frequently ask if we can get take-out instead, which in turn makes me feel like I'm doing a bad job. I try and stay on top of the laundry and dishes pretty well, but the overall state of our house is not something I'm proud of. 

My husband is an absolutely awesome dad and he's so willing to be involved and help when he can around his work schedule. I honestly love being a mom too, it's just been really hard that I don't feel like I get to be anything but a mom anymore. I'm half and half breastfeeding and pumping (about 4x each per day). If the baby isn't up, I'm usually hooked up to my breastpump, cooking/doing dishes, or doing laundry. I get a couple hours in the evening where I can take part in my hobbies, but by that point I'm usually so exhausted that I crash and get to bed as soon as possible. Any energy for physical intimacy with my husband is almost a distant memory at this point.

Anyways all of this aside I just feel like there's a normal amount of adjustment to being a new parent, but I feel like I'm on the verge of just not coping whatsoever. I'm having multiple breakdowns a month and I feel like I'm putting a lot of extra burden on my husband.  Is it just going to be hard until baby is X months/years old? I feel some added pressure since my husband is facing a possible big promotion where his workload will increase drastically and he won't be able to help as much as he is now. We also want more kids eventually, but I'm barely hanging on with one as it is. 

My husband was speaking to an older work colleague over the phone the other day and they were discussing a conference that was moving to online. They have evening discussions and my husband said that he'd try and be present once our baby was down for the night. The colleague was surprised that I wouldn't be able to handle doing that by myself and asked what I would be doing if he was having to travel and be at conferences in person. That's been eating at me for a little bit ever since it came up. The last couple of times my husband had to travel for work, my parents came to stay with me to help out (we're in the US and they're in Canada, so they've had to cancel all pending travel for the time being).

For those of you that have kids, do you have any tips on how to cope with the big life change? Did I just miss the boat on maternal selflessness that other women figured out before they had kids?",0

* Failing with women, goal is get women

* Some success with women, but never feeling like they are in control

* Success with women, failed LTR/marriage that reset them to beta or otherwise damaged their view of the sexual marketplace

* Tons of success with women, but no clue what to do except spin plates forever, feeling of nihilism

* Any of the above, but general disgust with current sexual dynamics searching for a way out

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The problem is not ""them being whores"". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT.


The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

I don't think politics should be removed from games, because you are forcing particular narratives to be silenced.

Story-driven games need to focus on the stories itself, and not being preachy. Games can't sacrifice what makes it fun for the sake of a narrative.

I dunno I'd like to think that if someone made a more awesome version of Dynasty Warriors but made it of any particular political viewpoint I'd be against, I'd still play it.

6493,6494,"Mental bandwith to listen, note body language, AND be flirty?I've got a problem with my metal bandwith. Over text I can be very flirtatious and escalate. Then when I go on the date, knowing this is supposed to lead to a hookup, I fail to escalate and make a move because I am so distracted by actively listening to the conversation and paying attention to body language that we have a fun conversation and that's it. She drops hints, but because my mental bandwidth is maxed out, I can't respond to them in the same way I would over text, when my mental bandwith is hardly being used at all. 

I can only do two things at a time, and here I'm required to do three.

* I listen, but ignore body language to be flirty and make moves, but screw it up because it's unnatural and ill-timed (because I'm not paying attention to body language).
* I pay attention to body language and try to make natural, well-timed moves, but now I can't keep the conversation going and things fall flat.
* I listen and keep the conversation going, and I pay attention to body language, but I'm too overloaded for flirtatiousness to enter my mind.

life and don't bother or interfere in gay people private life, it's not your
problem at all. if tomorrow you will have a gay child, what will you do ??
will you love him or kill him ??? if you are from old school we can't do
anything as we are living in new school now. the first groups who always put
mess in it are religious group or old minded people. how been religious people
are you so cruel and discriminate god's child. this is action is crime, not
being homosexual. being terrorists and dislike or disrespect people are more
criminal act than being gay. why you islam don't accept that, you only making
mess all around the world about this matter. don't you have lots of muslim
brothers who are gay around this world ?? why you hate and reject them, this
is criminal. if god against homosexuality he would not create gay people, it

As a teen I realized: wait I'm turning into a young man, this means I'm no longer loved as that little boy. As a male we are less important to everyone around us. Besides ourselves. 

I've discovered not giving a shit about most people (especially women and children) and caring about myself more. Not in an extreme way or anything. Just knowing that I am the center of my experience in this reality, and I shouldn't give up anything I can gain to anyone else just because they're a kid or a woman.

We as men are only as important as we make ourselves, because no one else is going to make us important for us. If that makes sense. Women and children are made important for just existing. This is why they require so much more attention and reassurance. They're addicted to validation.",0

###Physical

Goal: don't just *maintain muscle, gain muscle* over the next 60 days. 

Measurement: post cropped before and after pics as evidence.

Day 1 http://imgur.com/a/HT3NZYY

Week 1: 207lbs ~22%BF

Week 2: 201lbs ~20%BF

Week 3: 198lbs ~19%BF

Week 4/Day 30: 195lbs https://imgur.com/a/waZTVe6

Diet goal is to hit sub 15% BF during the Time Of No Lifts

Hygiene: I had already been brushing my teeth, washing my face, feet, and ass before finding MRP. I have now cleaned my living space and am going to keep it organized and orderly, I let things pile up over the last few weeks while I've been prioritizing work and fucking around with girls 

###Mental

If I don't put me and my responsibilities first I will end up right back where I started, possibly in a worse place. It needs to be where I'm not chasing pussy, pussy is chasing me, and I give it the time of day on my terms and on my time, when my shit has actually been owned, and I have time to spare that I want to spend enjoying the company of a woman worth my time.

The external validation is like meth, extremely addictive, and it had been so long since I've felt a woman's interest, it was like being a first time user. In some ways I really am. On some level I knew all this, yet was weak over the last 2 weeks and indulged anyway. I'm coming down off of the validation binge now, and settling into what I said I needed to do last OYS: a more manageable amount of time spent on plating. I'll continue to step down my time commitment over the coming weeks, and continue working on identifying when I'm interacting for their validation (don't do it) and when I'm interacting for my own enjoyment and giving my time freely without expecting something back. 

###Family

Still not spending as much time as I was here before plating, makes sense, you can only do one thing with your time at any given moment, I can't read 48LOP as a bedtime story to my 3yo, nor can I be at home with my kids if I'm out on a date, or at work, etc. 

###Financial

Saving a lot. Stimulus came in, saving that too. 

Bought some new clothes in prep for Style week of 60DoD, this should finish out the cycling of my wardrobe that I've done over the last 6 months, it will be piecemeal from now on, cleaning out old/stained things and replacing those with new ones. 

###Professional

My temporary assignment is nearly over, and the permanent promotions needed to free up that position for me haven't happened yet. They did extend me in this position though, another month. No matter what I'm in so much of a better position to take the next similar opening that its not even funny. I killed it over the last 3 months and everyone, I mean everyone, knows it. 

###Social

Been having fun on my dates. 

Fucked Property Manager again, this time without the Nice Guy backdrop - I just did what I wanted, came, and that was that. Didn't worry about her at all. Spent a total of an hour at her place? Doesn't really matter. I wanted to fuck, so I did. 

Date 2 with Nurse is tomorrow. She said maybe at first, so I asked the next day ""is it a yes for you, or should I put that time back out on the market?"" Her ""Woooow, you are cut throat"" I said, my free time is valuable to me, we can hang out next week if it isn't good for you, just don't leave me in limbo. She said ""Got it"" and agreed to the date. We are doing a private Happy Hour at a secluded spot I picked out. 

Date 2 with Diver is a maybe, this one is a good learning opportunity for me, she's super assertive and independent, and I'm sometimes not sure how to respond because of it. She talked so much that I don't have to say much. We agreed to a plan, and when I texted to confirm the day before, she reneged but offered to reschedule to the next day. So I told her to come up with the idea, and once she had decided and suggested it I put a plan together to make it worth my time and fun for me and gave her a part in it. That plan she followed my lead and completed her assigned part quite well. Internally I focused on not reacting to her having so casually altered agreed on plans and staying positive and fun instead of getting offended like a faggot that she didn't do what I wanted when I wanted.

Date 2 with Physical Therapist is a maybe. She's smart but kind of full of herself, maybe takes herself a little too seriously. 

Date 1 with Server who shit tested is later this week. 

Out of the 4 I like Nurse and Phys the best, they are the most fun to be with, but I'm keeping the pipeline moving. Lining up 4 more girls, but not taking so much time with any of them as I did the first batch. I'm learning.

###Marriage

STBX was pissed back in February because I sent our tax refund to my personal account, then transferred her half when it came in. ""It should have gone to our joint account"" - and now with the stimulus it automatically went to my account again  so she was upset again. So I told her ""You threatened to take money that doesn't belong to you when you overreacted to me putting the savings back in savings at the end of last year. I've shared everything we've received 50/50. Maybe don't make threats next time, and I won't feel the need to protect myself."" She tried to twist the facts, but I stood my ground, so she texted my mom a screengrab of our conversation . My mom told me she had and said I should be nicer... I told her to mind her own business. 

Nothing else significant... finally found a place still doing Notary work and made an appointment this next week to get the uncontested document Notarized, STBX will be there to sign. 

###Goals

Don't let on that I know about her indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (14 week streak)

Plating OPSEC (2 week streak)

Go to at least one Social activity without family. (3 week streak)

Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (9 week streak)",0

5144,5145,"Feminist Stance on Sex Robots / Robosexuality?Throwaway Account because I feel more comfortable this way.

So we've experienced some pretty rapid evolution in robotics technology the past few years, to the point where sex robots are slowly becoming a reality, rather than just a bi-product of science-fiction.

Being a robosexual myself, I've always wondered:

What is the general consensus about sex robots or the attraction to robots in general in feminism? I've barely found articles discussing those topics in depth, let alone feminist ones.

Feel free to ask for clarification if needed.

&#x200B;

EDIT: A question's been asked as to how one distinguishes robosexuality from objectophilia.

It's cerainly a good question, so it's not gonna be that easy to answer.

I can't speak for all robosexuals, but in the robosexual community I frequent the most, they generally enjoy the reveal of a human actually being a robot. Think of Terminator-like reveals where there is damage to the skin, showing that the person you thought you knew actually just a near-perfect replica of a human, designed to either blend in with or serve humanity.

I've also heard the claims that a big part of robosexuality is objectification, specifically of women. While there's a sub-group in the robosexual community that enjoys the idea of being turned into a machine designed for sexual contact., consent plays a big part for most of these types of robosexuals. They want to be turned into a machine. (There's also a sub-group that enjoys forceful conversion of people into robots; I personally don't enjoy that, but who am I to kink-shame.)

**A big part for many robosexuals isn't the objectification of the feminine/masculine, it's the feminization/masculinization of objects. Giving life to the impersonal of the modern era.**

&#x200B;

EDIT2: Many people mentioned consent, so I'll add a footnote here. Most people (there's always bad eggs trying to force people to roleplay or whatever, they are swiftly banned) in the robosexual community value consent highly. It's one of the big parts about the fetish even. **We don't find that robots just don't provide consent, it's more that robots always consent** because their sex-drive is infinite. At least until they run out of battery.",0

arises when people get tired of the natural process. And this is basically
because of the arising pornography and vulgarity that is openly viewed and
displayed and majority are prone to it so when they grow tired of the nature,
they tend to find pleasure in something that goes against nature. So we need
to support good and decent content on media and promote early marriages to
abstain from this taboo. And ofcourse this homosexuality is a sign of the day
of judgement as we Muslims believe so we need to seek forgiveness and thank
Allah for His blessings.

I dont believe this is true.

I think society functions best when the base assumption is everyone is entitled to being loved, having sex and enjoying at least one relationship.

I find it alarming that in a culture where we obsess about the health and welfare of the environment and animal kingdom, we care so little about each other and our collective mental health and happiness.

The superficiality and cruelty that define the dating market should be beneath the type of people we believe ourselves to be.

Incels of both genders should have access to legal prostitution and both men and women should be encouraged to be less shallow and more generous in their dealings with each other.

So many people now end opportunities for happiness because theyre not getting 100% of everything on their list, mostly women.

This dull, checklist-style approach to dating sucks all the fun out of interactions for both genders and leaves many on the sidelines who are good people and would make good partners if others could just get over their superficiality.

In short, I think the current state of dating is sad, cruel and shallow, and the idea that only the most shiniest people deserve love is a big reason behind it.",0

If she has boyfriend you as stranger pretty much have what to talk her about? She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to.

Approach instantly too (3 seconds rule), because lingering or following her around the store to approach is creepy.

2684,2685,"please stop valuing the opinion of men you see onlinethis is not a typical ""feel good"" post. this is a reminder.

**TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.**

if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value.

men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that.

but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better.

I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women.

these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s.

so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked.

also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks.

so don't give a damn about other subs like gonewild, butterface, etc. while facial bone structure is really really important there are many cute-the-girl-next-door girls who would be seen ugly online while in real life they would be wanted.",1

It's not a one size fits all but they do have an impact. At least, this is my understanding. The major differences come into play at the extremes of the deviation with some being more prominent than others. For example, interest in things vs people.

I'd agree that the perception of difference is greater than the differences themselves but your main argument is a bit of a Strawman against Feminists and MRAs to be honest. Feminism thinks the differences are small but socialisation makes men more violent on average (to use an example) and MRAs think socialisation and biology have an impact on behaviours but also that the negative traits of men are over reported and negative traits in women are under reported (and vice versa with positive traits).

And the fact that we often feel alienated from the discussions in our home as well as overseas is because we dont take multitudes of lived realities into account. Even if we do, we dont hear much about it and its often exoticized and seen as something bizarre  in the West. Its so frustrating because women from third world countries are assumed to achieve the feminist discourse in the West. The cultural nuances are completely disregarded. The collective voices of women from the third world heard. There is need to engage with lived experiences of multitude of women from diverse cultures and classes. Patriarchy affects us all but it affects some more disproportionately than others. Feminism at the outset should account for this.

work to serve the Families that seek to assist to resolve and recover from
minor domestic disputes / tussle / allegations etc. These Families suffer
trauma and depression in their attempts to be together again. Our first
priority is to save the family by mending the bitter relationship and also
know the reality of the allegations irrespective of gender. We directly or
indirectly help others to, support the main victims of domestic dispute and
domestic violence. Family tension affects people from all walks of life
regardless of gender, sexual orientation or race. Men, in particular, suffer
because of the lack of recognition and awareness by society and often the lack
of local services available to support them. It is a travesty of justice; we
cannot silently ignore because we've felt the sting of false accusations made
by women of domestic violence or anti dowry act (498A), and resolved to try to
prevent this injustice from continuing. We haven't been able to stop it, but

&#x200B;

In your post, you convey that you did a lot of things for your partner's sake that you didn't enjoy, that you were brainwashed by his ideology, and that you isolated yourself from friends.

&#x200B;

That translates to: You were willing to push aside your own boundaries and discomfort, put aside your ability to critically evaluate his ideology, and isolated yourself from other sources of stability and insight.  


It might sound silly, but almost all of us at some point in our lives are willing to do just that when: 1) We're in situations where we don't have much experience, or 2) We have some things about ourselves which cause us to feel insecure and willing to not respect our own wants and needs.  


The important part is to spend time learning more about yourself and figuring out if it was inexperience or insecurity.  If it was mainly inexperience, you can chalk this relationship up to the 'lesson learned' side.  You will know to avoid a man like him in the future when it comes to relationships.  


If it was an insecurity, you'll continue to date the same kind of guy again and again until you strengthen, heal, and understand the things you feel insecure about.  


Sometimes RedPill guys are right when they disparagingly say 'All Women Are Like That'... and sometimes women are right when they say disparagingly say 'All Men Are Like That'.  Not because what they believe is true, but because they live their lives in such a way that they filter out all the healthy people who are \*not\* like that.

It's important to learn from this relationship so that you don't partner with another man like that and end up losing friends and disrespecting yourself.

But you really lucked out that this relationship ended.

Women actively look for men who make more money.  Married men make more money not because the wife is cooking and cleaning which somehow helps them earn more, but because their wives saw that they were on promising career trajectories before marrying them:

A lack of high earning men will cause women to focus on their careers instead of finding a husband.  I believe this study was discussed here in the past:

___

A man's wealth is directly correlated with how women rate him.  A similar effect the other way around is small to non existent.  Men select for looks and personality.  Women select, quite literally, for looks and money:

A loss of income is the single largest predictive factor for a wife wanting to divorce her husband.  The same is not true the other way around.  And interestingly, a wife's inability or refusal to ""cook and clean"" does not effect a husband's willingness to divorce her, either.  I'm not sure if this study goes into this, but my guess is personality issues, things like nagging and harassment, might be the biggest factor for husbands:

######https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/

There is a study showing that most men (around 65%) would prefer to be stay at home dads / husbands, so there isn't much of a gender difference here.  Most people regardless of gender prefer to stay home over working a job.  Many would even call it a *privilege*.

Women just have significantly more power and control in the dating and marriage market, so they tend to get their way more often.  In fact there's a plethora of research showing that wives and girlfriends command significantly more power in relationships than men do.  I'll leave those out for the sake of brevity (and for veering outside the scope of the OP) but I can post them if requested.",1

If you think about friendships, employment, or relationships, there are always compromises and things you put up with sometimes this is real, and positive, and helps you maintain a long relationship when times are hard. Sometimes its toxic manipulation. 

But when something occurs that is so offensive to you that you realize youve been lying to yourself to maintain the peace. Then you snap, and its very painful. Plenty of divorces initiated from either party come from the straw that broke the camels back. 

As I said, this could be friendships, or even something like a sibilings relationship. You forgive, you accept, you think about the bigger picture, and then you snap (if the relationship is toxic)

It could be a job, so you rationalize that the pay is low, but its close, or they are lenient about you sick parent being frequently hospitalized, but your coworkers get offered more opportunities. Some of these things seem fair so you just reassure yourself with the positives, until one day you realized you wasted 5 years of your career, or opportunities to be more present with your children, with nothing to show for it. 

Relationships with men are the same. Yes, you should do the things that Laura Doyle speaks of with a man who DESERVES it. Thats the point of vetting. And seriously, ignoring addiction issues? Women who were stuck in loveless marriages with losers, mean spirited, addicted, cheating partners is what caused the feminist wave of the 60s and 70s. You can try and try and try to be a doormat, or pray, or forgive, but thats not a good relationship. Its not healthy for you. Its just convenient for him. 

The purpose of vetting is to find a man that will make your love easy, make your love flow naturally, and spontaneously, a life where conflict makes you feel protected and trustful, not fully responsible for just letting things slide under the rug. Find a man who is responsible, responsible for his own life, and respectful of the emotional support you will provide.

> I really feel dismissed and I feel like he's prioritizing his desires over mine.

First, it's irrelevant who makes more money, if you're not keeping your income separate. I make 20k more than my husband and I don't get to use that in arguments.

Second, it feels like he's prioritizing his wants over yours, because it's true. He wants what he wants, not what you want and it's as simple as that. I highly doubt he sees this as a sign of disregard or dismissal. He just wants some blinds and you already have a table. 

If you want to make progress on this issue, particularly if it's recurring and not just this one thing, you need to *calmly* explain how this makes you feel. This was his ex's table and you don't like it and have been wanting to replace it for years, to his refusal, and now you especially don't want to take it to a new house. You clearly have the expendable income and you've wanted to replace the table for longer than he's wanted blinds. You'd really like to get the table and make blinds the next big purchase. Perhaps you can sell the current table and put that money toward it. I also think it's worth mentioning that his response came off as really dismissive. 

The key here is to politely refuse to go pick up the blinds before talking about it, so you don't just end up with new blinds. Then calmly tell him how you feel without assuming he intended any of it. Then work together to reach a compromise. If you can't get the table now, because there's some reason the blinds must come first, then when can you? Can you start setting money aside with his blessing?",0

You can also tell by his rambling at the end he has very little experience with women and that it doesn't seem he's internalized much, even though he knows of Rollo's work.

Starving people, killing people, propaganda, censorship, cult of personality, eliminating classes, creating a rich elite that is devoted to the party only, no opposition, collectivisation, Godlike strict rules (you can not pass a red light as pedestrian otherwise -good citizen score, wtf?), the ""new man"", dictatorship, etc
All of those were present or are present in China.

Extra: I am aware that some things are present in republics also but too few. If you are a fan of a dictatorial, strict, severe regime, by all means, go and live in China but do not run their propaganda agenda. 
I preffer to live in a roman republic( most democracies are based on the roman republic model) than a communist system even tho I preffer the greek republican model. Of course, ancient.

That's not an argument why commie is good and it works.

And it's because it provides evidence of the fallacy of feminism and is an example of all the criticisms of the MRM/Anti Fem movement. And that can't be abided.

815,816,"The one thing: To get laid with attractive girls and rest deeply in a state of ""pure awareness""I used to be very state-dependent, always chasing it like if it was a drug

Until I realized that the key to be able to successfully connect with anybody at any venue has nothing to do with state

Connecting with others and developing intimacy with girls is about getting close within ourselves first

Doesnt matter what we do to try to fix ourselves, until we realize our inner sense of completeness well never get there

In the past I used to do lots of approaches, different stupid social freedom exercises, I used to learn a bunch of positive mindsets/ frame of reality

But none of these things were really sticking on me, it kind of felt like it was a constant chase and once that I would hit that state the next day it was gone lol

From there I came to the obvious realization that state is useless

Naturals arent state dependent they get laid in all kinds of moods cause they tend to be comfortable and at home with all of the different sensations they feel during a conversation, so why should we be any different?

Some of us are putting an insane amount of effort into trying to improve our body language, voice tonality, eye contact, lines and communication skills, frame, etc 

This takes a lot of mental energy, will keep you stuck in your head and it will keep reinforcing the fact that youre not enough and that you need more

The girls and other people will feel this too

So what about focusing on that one thing that will naturally help with everything else?

In the case, you didnt know the only thing you need to focus on is you

But here Im not talking about the mind, most seduction and self-development school focus on upgrading the mind with new programs but Im sure that many of us already felt the limitations of this paradigm(;

Here Im talking about that which is beyond the mind, the changeless always present You being in tune with this is true masculinity 

It may sound like nice philosophy but this is practical my friend, is an inner experience that once embodied will completely change how you communicate and how people react to you

Since practicing this connecting with strangers and especially girls as become super easy

When I authentically feel like I want to get laid, that same night Ill meet a girl and if the situation will be in our favor well have sex that night otherwise the day after.

When we go beyond the game suddenly things become spontaneous, we stop being limited by the paradigm of pick up and seduction and from there, girls start to experience us as more attractive and they genuinely will stick with us also after sex.

People, in general, will seek us out, invite to social events, cause now they see in us what they are looking for in them, this is the next level, my friend.

Start by giving up the wantingness to attain a certain inner state, realize that you have always been there...

There is nothing that you need to add, you are already complete my friend allow yourself to rest in this realization

""home""= ever-present sense of inclusiveness, that which never changes, that which is beyond every thoughts and emotion and at the same time includes them

6097,6098,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

This kind of ""tit-for-tat"" inequality, where the argument is that equality of a sort can be reached by a balance of inequalities, is in my opinion a barrier to progress.

3771,3772,"CMV: Social distancing will be apocalyptic for the dating lives of the 80%, and will cement hookup apps as the primary way sex happens and new relationships start.So first, two things that I'm sure everyone here on this sub agrees on:

1. OLD and hookup apps are heavily biased in favor of women and very physically attractive men. 

2. For men not in the top 20% genetically as far as looks go, meeting in person at a bar or party or other social venue is their best bet at pursuing women and giving themselves a chance to act attractively in a way that cannot be shown easily through an OLD profile. 

Well, now we are living in a time where it is unclear if bars or concert venues or even restaurants will ever return to the way they once were. Even when these establishments open back up its guaranteed that they will have to do so while observing social distancing protocols, limiting the number of patrons and perhaps even the kinds of interactions patrons can have. 

Basically, almost every single kind of public socializing venue is going to either close permanently or see up to 50% cuts in patronage and profitability, enforced either legally by public health officials, or emerging naturally because people will just be too spooked to go out in large crowds, probably for the foreseeable future. 

So what's going to happen to dating?

People will obviously still need to meet up and have sex, so workarounds will be found. Online dating already accounts for almost half of new relationships, and I think its pretty clear that this trend will accelerate in post pandemic Western society. I can easily see a future where people are posting negative COVID results on their profiles and going about meeting new sex partners privately, rather than risking going into public and exposing oneself to potentially thousands of unverified disease vectors. 

And, of course, for already naturally risk-averse women, anything less than Chad is now completely not worth the risk.

> Once Anna sought a divorceYou know what my lawyer called him? A parasiteshe, like many other women in her position, was in for a shock. Divorce lawyer Harriet Newman Cohen explains, The law is supposed to be gender-blind. Therefore, when a marriage is breaking up at the insistence of either the breadwinning wife or the supported husband, the lawyer has to apprise the client that when a big-earner wife comes in, the court bends over backward to be gender-neutral, and it is possible the bum is going to be rewarded for sitting on his hands.

6423,6424,"The old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off, because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics. 

Singularly, a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow. They might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief. But even then, they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of ""no innocents"" or at least, no touching those within their own communities. 

Then, as more of these organizations formed, they started getting more powerful. Forming alliances, making enemies of each other. 

Then drugs became a huge part of it, and a lot of the rules went out the window. 

Sometime during the 60s and 70s, when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs, they basically were at odds with gov entities, kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems. Their power wasn't really equal, but it was enough to be a threat. 

Where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did. 

It was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections, and that goes back even into the early days. 

If a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money, and ""reminded"" you that your business, and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate.... That probably meant that if that candidate lost, there would be repercussions. So those businesses needed to coerce their employees, their unions, etc., through whatever means, to vote a certain way. 

Well.... once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole, they have lose their usefulness in that regard, which is why they basically went extinct. 

I mean, sure... There are still shady organized crime rings, but it's mostly cartel linked stuff now. Nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day. All of that stuff more or less dissipated. 

They all either went to prison, died off, or went into politics. 

The same families, the same money, the same old power structures still exist somewhat... They just don't have the same ways of doing business. Now they just operate through political business dealings, big donors, and fundraisers. 

The ""protection money"" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money, assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out... But more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office... At which point donations are made to the campaign. 

Really.... You can think about the organized crime world like an organism with life cycles. The 20th century romanticized version of mobsters running around all Tony Soprano was basically the coming of age, angsty teenager stage. 

It matured in the 90s and 2000s and morphed into the adult stage that we have now.",0

The problem is that there is a lot of people in the field of gender equality which are only and exclusively advocates for women.

You can see how begrudging some of these schools were to allow men (into programs named for girls) simply so they could continue their agenda.

The problem is the mindset and goal is wrong. We cant even evaluate statistical inequality without looking at other things such as women making up 60 percent of degrees in masters programs. Just to point out how big that difference is and there is no school addressing it.

Also, I agree that STEM gives out harsher grades and there might be some difference either social or biological that causes that to affect women more. It could be because of inflated grades given for other subjects or if one sex is used to failiure more often that they perform better when failiure is a higher risk. However, we cant get to that conversation because people are trying to balance out percentages, but only ones they feel are discriminatory or that affect women.

I was sexually harassed by a guy in my campus and the entire incident was caught on CCTV cameras, so when I reported he was suspended but got off without any punishment by using a legal loophole in the campus rules.

Knowing this and the existence of this proof even having seen it themselves in some cases, I still see the same women becoming his friends and hanging out with him as if it's totally normal. 
He never apologized he denied the whole incident and then went ahead to spread rumours about me being a ""characterless"" woman, who was drunk and delusional.

Not just this, the popular girls here the ones that are considered nice and you know not problematic or feminist like me, are usually the ones who allow casual sexism, laugh at sexist jokes, and basically appease men. I have tried hanging out in these groups or been forced on several occasions, and I've been put off by the huge amount of shit that these girls are putting up with. And when I bring it up they make excuses and they say it's how boys are.

I'm sick and tired, I've never been able to have female friends, just a couple of them. I'm tired of the normalisation of this behaviour. Why would any woman play against her own team, why would she support molesters? Why are they so scared of even trying to understand what feminism stands for?

You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and
the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts,
situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal
level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very
existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but
at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so
important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or
dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the
opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we
should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all
educated and well read people) in a public domain? Aggression is good when
applied cleverly and certainly not in unidimensional rage.

To me the solution is not about equal numbers at all. However thats the rationale behind STEM programs so its useful to criticize other percentages based on that.

Optimally to me equality of oppurtunity would open doors to stem fields without closing any on anybody.....which includes men wanting to learn STEM in a greater proportion then women as is their choice.

Im embarrassed. It was pathetic and I feel awful that I was so entitled and put so much standards on women, that theyre supposed to be perfect, and one should come along and save me. Disgraceful. 

Women are flawed, and there are bad ones - that doesnt mean they arent beautiful. I have to start seeing women as individuals. Respecting them and respecting myself. 

I probably will never get laid, as I havent done so already. Im not that special, girls dont have to date me or have sex with me. Rather than being bitter about it, and blaming women - Im learning that my mindset is harmful to me and those around me. So, Im content with never having sex or being with a girl, thats their choice to not want me: however, I will love women, not be so entitled and pathetic, and have a healthy mindset for MY happiness.

3781,3782,"How do you dress breastfeeding boobs?I'm struggling with my postpartum body. I've pretty much lost all the pregnancy weight, but the weight was never the issue. My boobs grew like two cups sizes and I *hate* them. None of my light, flowy blouses fit. None of my bras. I've got a handful of shirts I'm surviving in and like three bras that actually fit...

What's worse, is most of my clothes thst do fit don't fit them right. I'm top heavy. And I can't wear any tight or supportive bras while I'm breastfeeding. And I actually breastfeed via exclusive pumping, so being able to access both to put on a pumping bra is a necessity.

And my husband finally has some time to help me with my intense nine month old and all the stores I would normally go to are closed. We are students, so I don't have a ton of money to spend. Amazon is a favorite.

So, all that being said, any words of wisdom or links to pumping friendly giant boob clothing? I'm finding that alot of cute, fitted dresses would fit my bust but be loose everywhere else. It's hard enough being a mom to an intense, high needs nine month old with medical issues, adding in that none of my clothes fit right and she needs to be outside everyday, it's all taking such a big toll!

5356,5357,"Your ability to break the rules is a powerful red pill truthI was sipping morning coffee and going over the worldnews sub when I came upon an article that mentioned how Japan is still reliant on fax machines and shit to report on Covid.  These people are required to go into work just to stamp documents.  Someone in that sub asked ""can't they bring the stamp home?"", which lead to the following response:  

>A question that only someone thats never lived in Japan would ask.

>There doesnt need to be any practical or logical reason for a rule

>Rules no matter how trivial are followed without question

>People actually go into a sort of shock if you violate a rule

>For example my wife once tried to order hot takeaway milk from a Mr Donuts.

>The server explained that you can takeaway coffee etc but not hot milk because you might not drink it right away and it could go bad and then make you sick. Long nonsense discussion

>My wife proceeds to order a hot milk to eat there and asks for an empty takeaway cup. At this point we assumed the server knew what was going to happen next because she gave my wife the milk and the cup without question and there really was only one explanation for wanting the empty cup.

>When my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.

>The sort of rule breaking that my wife just did literally doesnt ever happen in Japan.


This absolutely blew my mind.

Apparently following rules is so burned into their culture, that they wouldn't even consider breaking even minor rules.  

Another comment in the same thread mentions how you can't even order an omelette without rice.  You have to order the omelette with rice, then throw the rice out while the server stares in disbelief .


>Then my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.


Which got me thinking about the blue pill ""rules"" here in north america in context to the red pill (get a gf, get married, get her pregnant, pay her cash and prizes when she's ready to move on, and don't you dare deviate from that path you fucking sonofabitch!).


I realized our ability to say ""fuck this I'm gonna spin plates, avoid marriage, enjoy the decline, etc"" results in the same ""ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah short-circuiting in blue pill programmed individuals.

.


""Seducter, you can't fuck her, she's married!  ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah

.


Not only did I fuck her, but I sent her ass home to the husband who's cooking supper for her and the kids.


Just seeing that comment thread made me really appreciate the freedom that we have.  To be able to break free from society's conditioning and do what we want.  Imagine freezing up in a firestorm of cultural programming and indecisiveness because someone asked you if they could borrow your shovel.

First off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  
  
Anyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  
  
---  
  
So, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  
  
As a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  
  
We'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  
*""How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?""*  
*""What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?""*  
*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level""*  
*""Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  
*""YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU""*  
  
I honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  
  
A week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  
  
Gives me the good old speech:  
*""I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way""*  
I give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  
*""I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down""*  
*""blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.""*  
  
She eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  
  
The following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  
  
So wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  
  
Later the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  
  
---  
  
**What do I take from this?**  
  
* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out. She'll either come running back or move on.  
* Don't be deluded into thinking you're not replaceable, it's just your turn.  
* Maybe that was her way of breaking things off, but she thought I'd bite when she came at me like that, **giving her a reason to place the blame on me.**  
* It only takes her that short of an amount of time to branch swing to the next guy.  
* If I allowed that shit to fly the first time, I'd be operating within her frame, succumbing to the pressure placed on me in that situation.  
* Sometimes plates just break, that's why we have options. Without options I'd be hanging by my balls from her shoe closet.  
  
**TLDR; Plate initiates the 'relationship talk', doesn't get her own way so throws a tantrum. Then goes on to fuck the next guy after declaring love. AWALT.**",1

That doesnt mean you need to back off your job of healing people. Medicine is such a rewarding career and one women are good at! We are natural healers and caretakers after all! 

Anyway, the right man will love you because of how well you channel that innate ability. As to making him feel needed, love and support him in his journey, value his decisions, and tell him you love him, how happy he makes you, and the joy his brings to your life. 

Men are simple in that regard. They want to feel like they're contributing and that they're loved. Show him that he is by making his day easier. Maybe have a carafe of coffee waiting in the morning when you get up for residency. Little things like that.",0

4048,4049,"polarizing a woman I've known for a while - difficulty: lockdownHello everyone,

>TL;DR A girl I've known for a while, with some common friends. How to contact her and chat a bit, making your intentions of going out after the lockdown clear but without sounding like a sex predator or something?

I think this is something others are experiencing in this period too

So, there is this girl I kinda like, but we have a basic ""hello, how you doin'"" relationship since a while and haven't seen each other in months

Now, I'm thinking hell why not contact her, write a bit and polarize the thing, so when the lockdown is over we can go grab a coffee and you know.

I can see 2 problems:

\* I don't want to come off as creepy, contacting her now after months and we never talked much anyway. I really want a genuine connection

BUT

\* I don't want to come off as an uninterested friend neither. I mean, while I genuinely enjoy human contact and knowing people, regardless of everything, it should be clear that I am also looking for a more intimate thing, polarize it, that is.

I would just invite her for a coffee... if things were normal. But now?

Basic question you may ask me: why now after months?

Well, I'm a bit insecure and now I'm working on that part of myself, and also yes, I'm bored. And she is cute, and smart.

412,413,"My MGTOW story..Hello, my friends.

Grew up in an all-female home. No father. It is a criminal thing to do to a young man.

Yes, it fucks you up, but boy, you learn female nature early.

Joined the Army at 19. My first fathers were drill sergeants. Taught me about being a man. Still grateful. (Not sure what today's military is like, though..)

Afterwards, though, I was STILL blue pill, - I got down on one knee to propose (!) to a thot at 23(!).

We divorced 6 months later when she cheated.

Kinda red-pill after that- it was the early 90's- I MGTOW'D for 10 years, before it even existed.

Hit my 30's, decided I wanted kids.

Married the first mom type I found.

several kids and 15 years later, she gets the ""unhappies""..

Divorce cost over 500k.

My kids are teen boys- she doesn't understand- they come to ME, talking about Red Pill truths. She opened their eyes, without realizing it, during the divorce. I just help them understand.

Now, 3 years of payments remaining, then I. AM. DONE. Planning the remainder of MY life- MY kids will inherit MY wealth, after I've amplified it for myself, and then later, for them.

Lessons, for you younger brothers?

Women, are feral. Hypergamy is real.
(Women cannot handle power, and our divorce laws give them unlimited power- OVER YOU.)

Keeping your vows, honor, fidelity- these are knightly (masculine) concepts.
Women cannot comprehend them. ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.

Indignation is chick crack- in my case, she was a SAHM, with a 1k PER WEEK allowance, treated like a queen, but, it wasn't enough- she STILL needed to be "" the victim""..

The internet gave women WORLDWIDE a hive mind to tap into, one that thrives on victimhood. If she has a phone, she's never alone..

So-You ARE the prize. Build YOUR life. Amass YOUR wealth, and then PROTECT it. Lift. Learn. Laugh. 
Learn the Stoic way- master loneliness, 
and dependency. Start with The Meditations, by Aurelius. Work from there. 

Discuss none of this with women or SIMPs. Smile, Nod, Agree. Then move on. Reveal the Red Pill sparingly, to men ready for it. You'll know who they are..

Thus-your life is YOURS. You DO NOT exist to serve a woman. Any woman you ALLOW into your life, must be on YOUR terms, and serve YOUR purpose. YOU NEVER ANSWER TO ANY WOMAN, EVER.

In that vein- learn and understand female shaming techniques, and how they are used worldwide to manipulate men. Make yourself immune to them.

Flush the condom, yourself. Record any encounters. Or, just avoid women altogether. Work out safe sexual outlets- escorts, fleshlight, meditation, sex robot, whatever. 

Your male friends will do more to support and comfort you than ANY woman, ever. I have bros going back 40 years, now- we are brothers unto death- they've always had my back.

And, if you decide, against everything, to have children- be aware of the risks.
Expect her to behave as millions of other women have- from the beginning. Protect yourself in every manner possible, beforehand. Understand that, in the Western world- the deck is stacked against you.
 Perhaps you'll need to raise them in Russia. I don't know. Just DO NOT think she's ""different"". They did not re-write the X chromosome just for you.

And, be of good cheer. They quarantine  you only when your Truth threatens their Lies. We are winning. Deus Vult!",1
