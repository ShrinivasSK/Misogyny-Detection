480,481,"All guys know how disgusting they are, as a collectiveI was playing VRchat with my friends when we stumbled upon a younger girl who was talking about ""meeting a guy in real life"". As she spoke more and more people gathered, most of them were guys.

Then she said his age was 25, while she was just 13. Unanimously, every single guy in her immediately vicinity started screaming for her to ""not even think about it"" and that he ""did not want to meet up with her"". They all knew he was a pervert from the beginning, because they all are aware guys are all disgusting freaks. This is something men won't ever admit to, but they know is true - the only thing they care about is taking advantage of others. 

The fact that every single guy came out against her meeting up with this man shows just how much they have a coordinated language that only they, the fucking psychopaths, understand. 
It's not that they DIDN'T care about this girl, but instead knew what the outcome would be before it happened. They absolutely grasp just how repulsive men are, but can't admit it because they would have to call out each other - which they NEVER would do.",0
6055,6056,"Do you think a large number of millennial and gen z men will end up without a life partner and chance to reproduce?To clarify, [millennials are defined as being born between 1981 and 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials). Gen z are those born from 1997 onwards.

It seems like a lot of men in the millennial and gen z age range are really struggling with the sexual marketplace and finding a partner. Judging from my own observations and the discussion I read on the internet (not just on reddit, but across different social media platforms and forums). Women just consider them invisible. Large portions of them aren't having any sex at all, a lot less than previous generations, which means they won't get the chance to have kids unless that changes.

In contrast, it seems like the vast majority of gen x men and boomer men found life partners relatively easily. It seems extremely rare to find a 40+ year old man who hasn't been married, had kids nor had at least one long term partner (unless they are a Chad, but at least they are getting regular sex).

Men are told a lot on here that most men end up finding a partner and having kids, but do you think this will be true of millennial men and gen z men? What do you reckon?",0

It's amazing the emotional roller coaster that you go through once you do have kids to take care of.  I never imagined it possible to love anyone as much as I love these 2 little guys.  As a man there is a much deeper sense of meaning in your life that is discovered once you're a father and you would literally die for your kids without even thinking for a second.  The responsibility to take care of them and provide for them makes life so much more meaningful and fulfilling and that in itself provides a deep sense of purpose and happiness that I didn't know was possible.   This doesn't exist in a life where your only purpose is immediate gratification and pleasure seeking.

A traditional view is simply women cannot be raped (and even in many developed countries e.g UK, legally a woman can't rape anyone even a child) This will definitely lead to more cases now where men will have been raped by women... when a woman decides to carry on for 1 minute after the man hasn't consented? Was that finger consensual? What if the man was drunk? Sleepy? Title IX standards of evidence should make them easy to prove.

Lifetime:

* Four in ten men (41% or 3.7 million) and three in ten women (31% or 2.9 million) experienced physical violence.

Past 12 months:

* For men the proportion experiencing physical violence was 5.4% in 2016. 

* For women, the proportion was 3.5% in 2016.

In all cases it was more common for the assailant to be male.

Please note that this is physical assault only and does not take into account stalking, sexual assault etc. where the disparity goes the other way. 

For boys it is unclear, but the same survey found that around one in six women (16% or 1.5 million) and just over one in ten men (11% or 991,600) experienced abuse before the age of 15.

In the last weeks, you have probably stumbled upon some articles titled something like SELF-QUARANTINE : YOUR SURVIVAL GUIDE or HOW TO SURVIVE SELF-QUARANTINE and articles like these just elicit fear and anxiety among its readers. So Ive decided to take another approach, to change your perspective and encourage you to actually enjoy the remaining days of your self-quarantine.

First and to ease your mind, allow me to point out that once you look beyond the fear and anxiety, you will understand that there is an expiration date. You dont know when, but you know there is one. That alone will give you the strength to endure. This is the power of impermanence.

I know as youre going through it, it might not seem that way as theres a natural human inclination to think that whatever is going on is the way its always going to be. Obviously, thats not the case. This will be over again. It might be a few weeks, it might be a few months but it is going to end.

Allow me also to point out that you currently have one incredible asset in your possession that most people usually dont have in their lives which is time.  
Time is maybe the one asset in life you cant replace and we spend it usually running around going paycheck to paycheck hustling and bustling We have a period now where we dont have a choice but to have some time. Were stuck at home and that is actually an incredible opportunity.

I am going to list a lot of action steps that I consider very important so you can choose the ones youre interested in and focus on them.

The idea is to get you doing those things and do as much relaxation or entertainment as you want. That will be your reward! Whats important is that you enjoy your reward.

Lets get right to it...

&#x200B;

#### Be kind

Take 15 minutes from your day to call your grandparents or anyone you know who is especially at risk of complications from the virus.  
Check in on elderly neighbors you know (while keeping your distance). If they need supplies and feel unsafe going to the store, offer to go for them; or just give them a call to see how they are doing. And if you order something to your house, like pizza, generously tip the delivery guy.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Physically)

This is not a health pandemic. So please please please stay healthy!  
Dont get fat, keep eating well : get your fruits and vegetables. Take Vitamin D by getting some sunlight.  
This is a great moment to establish healthy routines by changing our diet and incorporating better nutrients into it.

Its also a great time to catch up on your sleep and let your body figure out your own personal circadian rhythm.

&#x200B;

#### Stay healthy (Mentally)

You can safely go outside while avoiding close contact with other people and touching surfaces that may be infected, and sometimes, this is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Soaking up sunshine and breathing fresh air will help rejuvenate you and make you feel better.  
You can also practice your walking past a stranger awkward smile you know the one

Weve all tried time and time again to get into a meditation routine, but there always seems to be something (like life, yknow!) that gets in the way. Well, now that many of us are staying home during the day we have the perfect chance to follow through on making this a new habit.

Another habit you can practice is self-care. It is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind healthy and happy. And self-care is imperative to stress management.  
And yes, for the guys reading this, its okay to practice some form of self-care. Its not exclusive to girls.

&#x200B;

#### Stay fit

No gym? No problem! We are creatures of habit and as such we get used to our daily routines and rituals. This is a great time to try and challenge yourself in other ways.  
Try a new fitness app. Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do squats in your room whatever you have to do. The important thing is that you keep moving, get your blood pumping and sweat as much as you can. This will benefit your mind and body equally.

&#x200B;

#### Read and study

One of the most amazing resources we have as human beings is the fact that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We dont have to relearn everything from scratch we dont have to figure everything out, almost everything you want to learn has been written down somewhere, its been put into a course by somebody or into a very good self-improvement blog (wink wink) so take advantage of this time to read a good book or study a subject that youve been wanting to study.

&#x200B;

#### Stay connected

Remember the phone? A long time ago it was used for a lot more than just texting and Instagram. Pick it up and call a parent, friend, or co worker. FaceTime with your friends. Improve your relationship with your family.  
Its important to keep working on your social skills, dont get rusty in that area and dont go into this depressive isolated place. This is actually in some ways an opportunity to bridge new social connections or to deepen the social connections you already have.

&#x200B;

#### Start your passion project

Not everyone is lucky enough to call their career or job their passion, but everyone has a passion. Maybe you want to start a home bakery or maybe you want to start your entrepreneurial adventure, theres really no better time than when youre sitting around doing nothing to get that in place and get that started.

You dont have to complete whatever project you start in the amount of time we are on lockdown, but you can definitely get the ball rolling and really create some momentum that would allow you to finish it soon.

&#x200B;

#### Learn a new skill

The business world is rapidly changing and new skills are needed constantly, but it can be nearly impossible to learn something new while youre just trying to keep your head above water at work. So take that online coding class, practice your video editing skills, or start learning a foreign language now. Imagine the surprise on your co-workers faces when you return from this hiatus speaking German!

There are lots of ways to teach yourself, with blogs, apps and online courses at your fingertips. If you learn a useful skill while away from the office, you will return to what may be a difficult job market with a leg up on your competition.",0
2289,2290,"I was quite frustrated and upset with myself when writing this post, so some parts were exaggerated.haha.

I always keep distance when driving in main road. Most of the scratches are from hitting front divider when parking and making sharp turn because I cant see it thus cant estimate how far my car is from the dividers. Still, its kind of worrying to keep scrapping dividers. I wish public transport is more accessible where Im living. Ugh.

Im trying to figure out my reference points when parking but tend to be panic when other car waiting behind me. Thanks for the wing mirrors tip! Will try to see how its with my car.",0

3672,3673,"There is grey area...if you just think about regular life in all situations without the red pill perspective, you will find a huge theme of personal growth in common human experiences.

If you think about friendships, employment, or relationships, there are always compromises and things you put up with sometimes this is real, and positive, and helps you maintain a long relationship when times are hard. Sometimes its toxic manipulation. 

But when something occurs that is so offensive to you that you realize youve been lying to yourself to maintain the peace. Then you snap, and its very painful. Plenty of divorces initiated from either party come from the straw that broke the camels back. 

As I said, this could be friendships, or even something like a sibilings relationship. You forgive, you accept, you think about the bigger picture, and then you snap (if the relationship is toxic)

It could be a job, so you rationalize that the pay is low, but its close, or they are lenient about you sick parent being frequently hospitalized, but your coworkers get offered more opportunities. Some of these things seem fair so you just reassure yourself with the positives, until one day you realized you wasted 5 years of your career, or opportunities to be more present with your children, with nothing to show for it. 

Relationships with men are the same. Yes, you should do the things that Laura Doyle speaks of with a man who DESERVES it. Thats the point of vetting. And seriously, ignoring addiction issues? Women who were stuck in loveless marriages with losers, mean spirited, addicted, cheating partners is what caused the feminist wave of the 60s and 70s. You can try and try and try to be a doormat, or pray, or forgive, but thats not a good relationship. Its not healthy for you. Its just convenient for him. 

The purpose of vetting is to find a man that will make your love easy, make your love flow naturally, and spontaneously, a life where conflict makes you feel protected and trustful, not fully responsible for just letting things slide under the rug. Find a man who is responsible, responsible for his own life, and respectful of the emotional support you will provide.

I feel like the whole ""women only date jerks"" narrative also puts the blame all on the woman too. As in, the idea it's a matter of woman's poor judgement that jerks get dates, rather than jerks shouldn't be jerks. I don't really know if there's an equivalent for men because I feel like even the ""men date crazy women"" narrative often comes down to blaming the women over the men who are dating them, when it is often the woman still blamed by the people judging women who date ""jerks.""",0

In 2018, similarly, [Chinas ambassador in Ottawa](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/the-lies-and-insults-that-china-has-pointed-at-canada/) said Canadas arrest of a politically connected Chinese tech executive was motivated by white supremacy. (Beijing then retaliated by [arresting two Canadians](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50592055) in China.)

The author, Thomas Brown, also spotlights both unethical media behavior and hypocrisy on the PRC's end:

>Yet we must also be aware that the Chinese government has learned to weaponize our own progressive tendencies, and has learned to exploit false accusations of racism against democratic societies. Ironically, this same Chinese regime encourages racism and xenophobia domestically.  
>  
>Government-controlled Chinese media routinely stirs up nationalist hostilities. And Chinese television frequently plays on racial stereotypes. Chinas biggest Lunar New Year television show, with an audience in the hundreds of millions, in 2018 [featured skits](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2133558/racist-chinese-spring-festival-gala-tv-show-causes-consternation) with a black man playing a monkey and a woman in blackface with a huge posterior. In one [2016 ad for laundry detergent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/china-racist-detergent-advert-outrage), a Chinese woman stuffed a detergent pod into a black mans mouth and shoved him into a washing machine. Out popped a pale-skinned Chinese man.

>The *Global Times*, a state media outlet, is well known for [inflammatory, offensive editorials](https://qz.com/745577/inside-the-global-times-chinas-hawkish-belligerent-state-tabloid/) about foreign countries. One declared that should Australia continue flights over the South China Sea it would be a shame if one day a plane fell from the sky and it happened to be Australian.

Given how the Chinese Communist Party is [already doing an amplified version of all of the above](https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1238349802338807808) in an attempt to deflect complicity in the coronavirus outbreak and blame the US for its own bungling...yeah, it's got global ramifications.",0
3740,3741,"There are a lot of different ""types"" of people and what they say they want vs what they want.  I've noticed this with both sexes too.

I am a secure man (think Christian red pill) and I fully support my wife finishing her education and both her current, as well as future proposed career, among other things including helping her learn anything she wants, getting hobbies, and having self-care time (as Laura Doyle mentions is so critical).  I was not hesitant about any of the things you mention, but that is because I largely knew what I wanted and I was pursuing real love, not lust, or just friendship with benefits or something.

The biblical Proverbs 31 woman is so capable she works to sell things and even buys property.  But the key is - everything she does is part of her household team with her husband and under his authority.  It clearly talks about how her husband can hold an esteemed position because she is truly his helper, she supports him so he can function at a higher level.  Wow, I would love to have this type of support!
Can men abuse their authority? Definitely.  Can women be just as abusive like that or in other ways?  Definitely.  So again, it comes down to each person's individual heart - what they truly believe in and live out.  And I agree with the comments that it is an utter shame that most of us are not taught these key concepts, both men and women.  There are so many opportunities in our childhood and teen years to teach them.  My children will not grow up in ignorance and they and their future spouses will greatly benefit from that.",0

Somewhere in Southeast Asia...

We were all in high school age...

It started with my cousin, the light skin Chad-lite. 

His friend, the normie 6'0"" basketball player. 

And, the young femcel who was about 14-15 years old. She was brown skinned with severe acne problems. Her dry hair is always at chin length and never grew. 

All of us knew each other because we lived in the same area and played together. Then I moved to Toronto.

One day, cousin called me and CACKLED about what happened. He told me that Basketball player, femcel and him went to the outdoor flea market together after school. The femcel suddenly disappeared. They didn't waste a second to wait for her.

""Bro, let's go!"" his basketball friend told him. 

So the him and his friend left her there and went home without telling her. 

I asked him. ""Bro, why!?""

He said. ""Who the fuck am I to wait for her!? She's not even pretty!""

Well, that was mean. 

Fast forward, the basketball player asked her out, for God knows why. She agreed. He never brought her anywhere in public. Never held her hand. Never showed her affection. 

You wanna know why?

My cousin told me that. ""He dated her because he wanna \*have sex\*.""

Out of every place he could've done, he broke up with her in the CROWDED market after HE TOOK HER VIRGINITY. She ended up breaking down into tears in public in front of at least 100 people. My cousin was cackling, telling me all this.

I feel so bad for her.

4979,4980,"Fwbs - Unsure if she's pulling back...confused on what to do?I'm unsure if she's consciously pulling back, she's lost interest, or she's just comfortable....but something has changed. 

I've been seeing my female colleague Fwbs for the last 6/7 months. She initiated the whole thing and we called each other our 'distractions'. 

Sex started out as once a week, which gradually increased overtime. In Feb, she told me we may have to stop as she's starting to feel attached. I think this was to gage my reaction and interest level.  Up until then, I held my emotions close to my chest and always let her bring up the flirtiness and 'emotions' first - she would often message saying she would like a cuddle or whatever and then apologise for ""needines"" saying as ""there's no place for it"".  I always reciprocated to the same level and energy. 

Then in March, I started to compliment her more and tell her how much she turned me on etc. At the start she told me she was very needy and insecure - and believe it or not, but these compliments and reassurances did wonders for our 'relationship' - we were having sex nearly everyday. We ended up staying a night in a hotel through work - the day after, she was telling me how much she liked it and that it made her feel like she wanted more. She then wrote me a long message about how attracted she was physically/sexually and started it off by saying ""some things are best left unsaid"" - I asked her but she refused to tell me. At this point, it was her doing most of the chasing - I was just sitting back and letting things happen. 

Then lockdown happened. We have a bit of freedom so can see each other occasionally. For the first few weeks, she would come over a couple times a week, however, I would always have to ask her (I've always done it, I think she feels too vulnerable in making plans for sex) as she would never invite herself round. She was still being flirty by message, saying she wished she had more time etc. to come round. 

Then, 3 weeks ago, I asked her round and she said she couldnt but ""would honestly love to see me. Maybe tomorrow?"". I said ""yes, providing you can get here by xx as my roommate will be in"". She replied ""I will see. You can always meet me for one of your walks on the weekend"". I said ""my roommate normally comes with me so we'll have to see"". She then had a slight outburst and said ""you told me you normally walk alone, good to know I won't have to go out my way"". I replied ""he does on the weekend but not in the week"". Anyway, she said that was ""nice we do that"" and then messaging continued in a normal chit chatty vibe.  I will admit, I did tell her I walked alone everynight a few days before and I only said my roommate comes with me on the weekend to lash out in response to her saying no - she's always so flakey and I felt like she asked me about 'going for a walk' as I didn't reciprocate her saying ""she would love to see me"".  

From that point however, she has taken a lot of emotion and flirtiness out of her messages. We've met 3 times since, once for sex and I can still feel her physical attraction is strong. But her messages have been quite dry. I will also say that she does continue to message me first everyday (always, always messages me first) until we say goodnight, but it's mainly chit chat and about work stuff. She seems to deflect any flirtiness and doesn't initiate any emotions anymore. 

I like her a lot and want more but it's difficult as we work in a very small team, and neither of us wants to be rejected. 

I just find it odd that up until the whole walking conversation, she told me a few days prior that she was missing me, and that seeing me once a week wasn't nearly enough. Then a few days after the convo, we met up and she said to me ""little every so often is nice though, at least it's something"". I mean, seriously? 

Another interesting point, is that nearly a week prior to the walking convo, we had sex and she messaged afterwards. It seemed like she was 'teeing' me up to be emotional towards her first but I didn't. Nothing obvious but my gut told me by her messages that what she was doing. And when I didn't, it's like she tried to play it cool after. 

I want to ask her if she's okay but it's been a while and I wanted to see if she would come around and be more open but she hasn't. I also don't want to ask her as it will make her feel vulnerable and she will likely deny it anyway. I'm also cautious that perhaps I've overpursued her and she's losing interest and backing off slowly. 

Is it best to just play it cool, give her space and let her come to me more, or just tell her ""I think I upset you?"". I wonder if she's slowing things down to keep her emotions in check - perhaps she realised we were getting carried away? I just don't want to blow it by coming across as needy and seeking validation when there's nothing concrete to present back to her...",0

113,114,"California ex-DA fabricated that a TV Doctor raped 1000 women with no proof, says new DA "" DA Says Couple Accused of Drugging and Raping Up to 1,000 Women Did No Such ThingEx-DA Made it All Up

 

A California prosecutor is dropping all charges against a doctor and his girlfriend, alleging that his predecessor manufactured allegations that the couple drugged and sexually assaulted up to 1,000 women.

The stunning turn of events comes a year and a half after the case against [Grant Robicheaux](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dr-grant-robicheaux-orange-countys-most-eligible-bachelor-accused-of-drugging-raping-women), an orthopedic surgeon who appeared on the TV show *The Online Dating Rituals of the American Male,* and substitute teacher [Cerissa Riley](https://www.thedailybeast.com/cerissa-riley-arrested-for-rapes-with-dr-grant-robicheaux-was-an-evangelical-missionary) exploded into the headlines.

At the time, Orange Countys then-district attorney, Tony Rackauckas, claimed the pair lured women to their Newport Beach home, knocked them unconscious, and raped them.

At a press conference in September 2018, he said investigators had seized hundreds of incriminating videos from the couples phones. Asked whether the number could be as a high as a thousand, Rackauckas said, I think so.

A few months later, though, Rackauckas was out of office, replaced by current DA Todd Spitzer, who eventually ordered a review of the evidence. He says he was appalled by what he found.

**The prior District Attorney and his chief of staff manufactured this case and repeatedly misstated the evidence to lead the public and vulnerable women to believe that these two individuals plied up to 1,000 women with drugs and alcohol in order to sexually assault themand videotape the assaults, Spitzer said in a blistering statement.**

As a result of the complete case review I ordered beginning in July, **we now know that there was not a single video or photograph depicting an unconscious or incapacitated woman being sexually assaulted.**

Rackauckas has not responded to his former rivals allegations. But Robicheauxs attorney praised the reversal...""

So the next time you hear how Bill Cosby must be guilty, just look at all of his accusers, think real hard about it.  If a DA could literally find 1000 accusers out of thin air that a new DA has determined to all be fake, every single one, all of a suddenly it becomes much more plausible that a congo line of fake accusers be rolled out against any man.  Come on, if there was really all that much rape out there, do you think the DAs would have to be inventing ones that don't exist?",0

I know the meaning can be unique for certain people, but these last few months in quarantine have revealed to me that his political views are really different from mine. After making him dinner (again), we got into a heated argument on the gender wage gap. He doesn't get that (despite being illegal), female counterparts are paid (on average, counterparts meaning those colleagues in identical roles) less than their male counterparts. And now I am starting to doubt myself...

Yes, women have historically taken on lesser-paying professional roles, which is what my partner was arguing. I get that. But from what I've learned, it goes beyond that.

As for your specific example - if a girl uses text messaging differently from you, then just be straight with her on how you use it. If you don't often text because you have other things on your plate, then simply tell her this but remind her that you're still interested and want to see her

If you lose the girl because she liked texting more than you then (1) you dodged a bullet because she might have been using you for attention, or (2) you both dodged a bullet because you two expect to be using texting in a different way in a relationship

You're breastfeeding and running a household, that's an enormous amount of work and it's a 24/7 job. Feeling like you're a failure or losing yourself is normal, it happens to us all but it's not a part of motherhood that's openly discussed. I do worry about you mentioning frequent breakdowns. Have you been screened for post partum depression or anxiety? Your OBGYN should be able to help. 

For practical advice, find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. I mean for everything. Make a couple of hours a week after the baby is in bed for you and your husband. Take some you time. Even if its getting up fifteen minutes earlier to enjoy a cup of coffee alone. Those alone minutes can be the difference between staying calm and losing your shit entirely. If you're able, hire a babysitter one night a month for a date with hubby. Remember it's okay to ask for help. I waited until my youngest was three to hire a nanny and she's a godsend. Her creativity and input is well worth every penny I've spent and she's become an invaluable part of our family. 

And finally, this to shall pass. All of the struggles you have are temporary and you'll be okay. Your baby will be okay if you're not perfect and so will hubby. Don't compare yourself to other moms or families. You're doing great.

rude and short tempered..that's his fault and director portrayed the impact in

to do whatever Kabir singh does...if anybody gets inspired..then he will be
also inspired to kill people by only playing PUBG

which hero fights villains without any weapons(like he is superman).at least
something is different from the previous Bollywood romantic movie trend..

being is not portrayed? Who stays confused in his life? I think you have not

3418,3419,"> Communism is bad: Starving people, 

so the millions starving due to poverty due to the existence of capitalism and socioeconomic class everywhere in the world is okay, but communism causes starving is bad?

look you are romanian, surely you know what happened to post-soviet states after the ussr fell - how crime, poverty and hunger exploded over night? capitalism causes far more deaths than it helps. also, the only reason europe has a good lifestyle under capitalism is it exploits poorer countries for their resources.

also, under both soviet and chinese communism, their goal was to eliminate starvation and give everyone access to food

>killing people, 

right and capitalism doesn't start wars over oil or resources for the benefit of a few? I'm sure syria and libya would beg to disagree

>propaganda, censorship, 

I have shown you in OP how capitalist/democratic systems engage in propaganda/censorship. if you really think that there is no propaganda in the West, you're delusional

>cult of personality, 

how is raising someone as an example for people to follow bad? This is literally what happened throughout all of human history through figures like odysseus/or skaldic bards.

>eliminating classes, 

so giving everyone equal opportunity to succeed is somehow bad? isn't this precisely what europe is doing now anyway?

>creating a rich elite that is devoted to the party only

capitalism creates a rich elite devoted to money only, that allows them to justify traitorous immigration laws, avoidance of tax, unbeneficial laws, etc.

>no opposition, 

all of the opposition in western countries is controlled, because any opposition that threatens the status quo is either shut down through concepts like 'hate speech' or the powers that be do everything to discredit it. how is that any different from what the communists do?

>collectivisation

and why exactly is collectivization bad? collectivization protects the individual from harmful influences, gives him a goal to live towards and protects him from the consumerist nihilism present in the modern world. in fact, collectivization would solve many western problems from the opioid epidemic, to obesity, to feminism to male suicide.

collectivization is holding people to a standard necessary for survival/prosperity. if you oppose it, you oppose standards, which means you want to stay mediocre making you essentially bluepill

No most democracies are not based on the roman republic model. the roman republic model is actualy close to the chinese ruling system, where a small cadre of men (the senate or in china's case the politburo) make decisions and then execute them.

western nations are a twisted form of athenian democracy.

>hina is doing better economically, yea, in some areas facing starvation, poverty and other stuff like that. If it is as you say, would you also add the argument that Germany under A.H. was an economical power also?

just because there is poverty in some places in china does not at all take away from its economic achievements. it has singlehandledy raised hundreds of millions out of poverty and continue to raise millions more every year.

And yes, germany was an economic miracle under AH

>Ok, I see why you bought women into discussion, you made a point. Well, communism exists in countries like Cuba, China, N Koreea, Vietnam, not sure about Venez and all of them are crap holes, except China that is doing better because they liberalised their economy.

3887,3888,"Is the happiness and fulfillment of bottom tier men dependent on the suffering and misery of women?Did I get that right?

So we have this ""sexless"" men problem. Of course these guess talk about sex but every-time we say get a prostitute they say the problem is love and intimacy . 

Something about sympathy because maslows hierarchy of needs aren't being met and a section of men are going to start offing themselves. 

But there's a reason these guys aren't getting a girlfriend. It's a free market hence very competitive. You are both the product and the sales man. These guys either have shitty products, are shit sales men or both.  Basically no woman wants to buy what they're selling. And some set their price too high (they only want hot chicks). 

And these failed sales men are very sad. They can't get girlfriends/wives. They'll stop working because they'll never have a family. Something something taxes. Then they'll shoot up a couple schools . Did I get that right? 

Once upon a time it wasn't a free market. Markets were very regulated and women couldn't choose who they wanted to marry. Being young wild and free was shamed. And pre-birthcontrol that lifestyle would have been much harder. 

Women married men they didn't feel anything for. They had sex with and raised kids for these men. They lived quite lives of servitude and were more or less miserable. Not all women . Just the women who had to marry the bottom tier men. 

After the sexual revolution women no longer had to date and marry bottom tier men. Online dating was the  dating markets version of globalization hence ""Chad( The Chinese)  is stealing our women( manufacturing jobs)"". So anyway these men stopped getting sex and we're back to current 2020. 

It seems there's no middle ground. Either the bottom tier men get wives and are happy and productive  while their wives are miserable.  Or the women date who they want and are free to be single while bottom tier men suffer from loneliness. 

Personally I wouldn't want my daughter being forced to date someone so he won't commit suicide or shoot up a school.

4633,4634,What is the line between being a girlfriend and being a wife?Part of using the red pill dating strategy is to marry someone who values you as the woman you are and to keep that marriage healthy and happy. Something I've noticed though is women acting like a wife when they are only a girlfriend which only gives a man more reason not to marry. What do you think is the difference between being a girlfriend and being a wife is? What behaviors should a wife do but not a girlfriend as to not give too much to a man who hasnt fully committed to her yet? I am sure there are many different answers for different women even within this community. As someone who is a girlfriend and not quite a wife Im interested in what you ladies think.,0

If I held that spider to get over my fear, and it bit me or jumped on to my face, I would be even more afraid than before cause I would have verified my fear is rational. If someone who is afraid of women was told just do it with no social skills, they will have a bad experience and further push them away from approaching. Theres a process that needs to happen well before actually trying to overcome the fear.

I'm a woman who's been fortunate to find success in her career, so I end up having a significantly higher income than a lot of men I meet. This isn't something that really concerns me. The way I see it, if we get married, my money becomes *our* money so it doesn't matter in the end as long as my partner can support himself and shares my financial values. However, what I discovered over and over again in the dating pool was that men themselves seemed to have more of an issue with it than I did. 

What was most hurtful was when I would begin seriously dating someone only to discover they felt insecure and resentful about it further down the road. They didn't like their girlfriend picking up the tab for things. They felt stupid waiting for me at home while I worked long hours. They didn't want to play ""second fiddle"" to their girlfriend as they saw it and have my career be the one dictating our living situation. These things hurt their pride and made them feel emasculated.

I don't believe every man is like this. But isn't this how TRP would have men act? The brand of destructive masculinity TRP touts would have you believe that all these things ARE inherently emasculating and negative. Would they allow their girlfriend or wife to have a career that comes up against theirs or be the primary breadwinner in their household? My sense is no.

So what is the end result here? If that's the case, I'm effectively forced into giving up my lucrative career at my partner's behest, or only dating men who equally or more successful than I am who won't feel threatened by me. So wouldn't RP ideology force me into ""hypergamy"" on its own?",0

In the past week alone, I went to make a purchase with my LTR. Because she didn't want to meet up one-on-one with a random guy from the internet. Know what happened? After she bought shit from him, he spammed her phone with messages asking if I was her BF, if she was interested, if she wanted to add him on social media, blah, blah, blah. And I was there and she said maybe two words to this man. I handled the transaction. And that was one of two times THIS WEEK something like that happened.

You're looking at this wrong. If you're with an attractive girl, THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. Get used to it or start dating uggos. Stop fearing the competition--be above it. If you're with a hot girl, you should ALREADY be above most of the competition. It shouldn't matter. Treat yourself like you're #1.

My brother got into a massive argument with my parents accusing them of never giving a shit him and never listening to him about his mental health. 

Hes a real stubborn type, never will listen to anything new, left wing, blue pill kinda guy, in college, never had a job or a girlfriend. Sits inside all day and beats off and plays video games. 

I come downstairs because of all the yelling, and see him banging his head against the wall just screaming telling my parents to leave him the fuck alone, my dad trying to grab him to stop him from banging his head, while my mom tells my dad to just let him run his course, and that if he truly wants to kill himself we wouldnt be able to stop him 

He storms out, steals my bike, so I try to go follow him, but cant catch up. I get my parents to call the cops, so they can find him before he tries anything. They find him over the edge of a bridge, and get him down. Hes in the hospital right now. 

I was never close with him, or any of my family. What do I do moving forward? Hes so stubborn, so if he doesnt end up killing himself, idk how Ill get him to turn his life around, which I think is the root of his problems. 

Hes very convicted, and I think because of his depression and low serotonin, he reacts to any attempt to help him change with extreme hostility. 

Any advice on how to move forward? How to help him? Or at least keep my family from falling apart?",0

The problem with kabir singh is not with the negativity of the character, but
with the people buying into the negativity. People are proclaiming him the
HERO and is glorifying him as an inspiration!  
Kabir treated Peeeti as his Toy, his 'Bandi'. Kabir at no point asks preeti
for her consent regarding his forcing her to be into relationship with him,
which can mislead many men too, even lots of girls will find it cute too..

regressive to the society..  
The character is celebrated as a romantic lead which is dangerous if subjected
to real life, people are finding his actions , his abuse, hus anger cool.. his
negativity is celebrated but thats really wrong.. his character is so real
that it can provoke men in our country...

3182,3183,"Self improvement resources for being a better/warmer conversationalist and for regulating emotionsI couldnt find this specifically through the search functions. Anyone here has book recommendations or practical applications on how to improve conversation skills in RPW context (I feel like conversing as a businesswoman is very different) and on how to regulate emotions?

Struggling with these two aspects a lot - its the last two things on my list to work on for my current self improvement journey. 

For conversation, I struggle with putting on a social mask, so to speak. Social niceties and sounding open/warm drain me a lot, because my character tends to be more calm, straightforward and logical, even serious. When Im not mentally prepared to make small talk, sometimes I get nervous and dont know how to reply, unless there is a point to the conversation (eg. we are meeting to discuss X, for example) or it is a genuinely interesting discussion without the social niceties filter.

I worry sometimes that I may be good for stimulating discussions, but may not be warm/affirmative enough. How can I present myself as warm in a conversation, without having to act bubbly? (I do feel warm and open to listening, Im just not sure that Im coming off that way!). I also have a very low threshold for bullshit, and many times conversations seem to involve white lies, feigned interest, bullshitting, which make it tiring. Is this a perspective problem that I have or is this something everyone just does out of practice?

This area in life has confused me so much. I would rather I have a more natural strategy too because I dont think I can keep up an act for the rest of my life. My MBTI is INTJ because it may explain some things.

My goal = be a better *female* friend to my female friends (not just a *masculine* friend), and a soft place to land for my future partner



Also struggling with regulating my emotions, I tend to change moods very quickly and dwell on the past/future a lot, and although there are no major mental health concerns, I would like to feel more stable/in tune and in control of my emotions. Stronger. I cant go to therapy at the moment because I pumped my money into fitness/feminine goals. Can anyone recommend some books?

Any other self improvement suggestions for soft skills also very much welcome. Hope everyone is safe and healthy in this climate!",0

I know, I know. Abundance - but that's currently not an option. Social distancing is heavily enforced in my country, clubs and gyms are closed, my school reopened but teachers are very strict about the rules. Tinder might even be counterproductive as meeting up is prohibited. 

So when abundance is impossible, what can I do to kill my oneitis? I don't want to break up either because in my current state of mind I'd probably feel very beat down about it, and I'll take my finals in two weeks, so that won't be good.

To give some info, I [29F] have been with my boyfriend [30M] in the relationship phase for around 5 months now. We were in the dating phase for around 3 months before he asked me if I was interested in becoming a couple (relationship). I was initially surprised since I felt it was a bit soon for me, but I did (do) like him a lot and thought why not give it a shot and see what happens.

I feel that our chemistry has been very similar to the dating phase to the relationship phase, other than the fact we are dealing with lockdowns right now (like most people around the world). I like him a lot! I really do. But, I have noticed over the last month or so of talking with me, he brings up a lot of interesting topics around me. Last weekend when we were together, we ended up having this conversation where he was saying; *You were riding the cock carousel before you met me.* - things like that.

I did figure out in the dating phase that he liked the YouTuber, Entrepreneurs in Cars, since we talked about a couple of videos that Rich Cooper posted (he likes him). One of the reasons I like my boyfriend a lot is because I feel we can talk about pretty much anything and have good discussions. Im always trying to be the feminine addition to his life and compliment him on his journey. However, I dont like him accusing me of things like riding the cock carousel, or even when he mentioned me possibly monkey branching on him for another guy.

The last few times these comments have come up, it has bothered me quite a bit because I like him a ton. I dont like him accusing me of things that are not true (i.e. I havent rode the CC). Im looking for advice on how to approach this topic if/when it comes up again. For some reason, I feel like it will come up again at a later date and I would like to shut it down completely. Any thoughts or advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated!

toxic man who might have beaten women or you are supporting movie only because

but at the end he is shown as true lover. People like this are main reason
behind rapes & domestic violence & it's supporter like you are also part of
it.  
People like you are biggest hypocrite because you people will start blabbering
about Sanskar after watching 4 more shorts or Veere di wedding but proudly
defend a toxic masculinity character. If you are really honest person then
just for few minutes imagine a senior of your sister treating her like this in
the name of love. Will you let your sister to marry him at the end if she
tells you that she is sorry for all this toxicity?? Do answer if you will

5310,5311,"Although pinnipeds are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, such as sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.

The meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.",0

\- Women are hypergamous, they place priority on finance and status and stability. But hypergamy isn't the only thing that women care about. Likewise how men don't always care about looks alone. It's complex.

\- Alpha F\*\*\* and Beta bucks concept makes sense but **to me it applies to both genders**. I'd also be okay with a really great looking woman who's loyal and supportive and all that, yet fun in bed? ""Alpha males"" just seem to give off the vibe that they would be good in bed anyways so perhaps some women who are feeling it at that point of time would be more inclined for casual sex, in this case when they are ovulating which does seem to be the case even with girls I've talked to about ovulation (good friends so we talk about weird stuff all the time..)

\- Spinning plates theory. The number of plates they ask you to have seems abit unnecessary. Nonetheless, having options seems like a good idea.

All in all, i just took away the fact that I need to have more self-respect, self-improvement and I need to be more strategic in the sense that I don't subconsciously put a girl on the pedestal just because she ticks some boxes.

4737,4738,"Do you think breasts are inherently sexual?Sorry if this sounds a bit scattered, I'm just writing a stream-of-consciousness about my thoughts on this right now. This question has been haunting me for many years. I remember this one time I was at the beach when I was young and I was watching the boys around me wearing just their swim trunks and how free it must feel not to have to wear a top, and I felt this sort of painful longing. I felt sad that girls just couldn't do that, because boobs are ""inappropriate"".

Now that I'm older, I have many more thoughts about this. I still feel the painful longing I felt when I was younger whenever I see men just being allowed to have their shirts off and not have to cover their nipples. And I just wonder, why is it that boobs are seen to be nearly as sexual, if not *just* as sexual, as genitalia? There is really no difference between male nipples and female nipples except for the female breast's function to breastfeed, which requires more fatty tissue.

My theory on this is that women's bodies are just so objectified and oversexualized in every way that even body parts that seem biologically and inherently sexual really *aren't*. Rather, everyone in (at least western) societies have become socialized to cater to the male gaze, which views women through a lens that hyper-sexualizes women for male benefits. I do not think that female breasts are inherently sexual; rather, our response to viewing breasts in a purely sexual way is a result of being trained over and over and over that breasts are for men's sexual viewing pleasure. We have sexualized women's breasts so much that women cannot even breastfeed their children in public, a normal biological need, without being hyper-sexualized and condemned.

Theoretically, I think it is possible for women's breasts to be seen as just as nonsexual as men's are. It will take many, many years of deconstructing the male gaze and removing men from the position of the ""default"" human being (thereby removing marginalization), but I think it can happen. For the most part, I believe we have a choice of which body parts we choose to sexualize or not sexualize (besides *maybe* genitalia). For instance, biologically, cis straight women overwhelmingly prefer men with larger shoulder to hip ratios, but you do not see men's shoulders being covered up and hypersexualized. I do not think that is because men's shoulders are actually ""less sexy"" than women's breasts; rather, I believe it is because most societies have been designed for men, with men being the ""viewers"" and women being the ones who are viewed. And so, men's preferences and decisions on what is ""sexy"" or not have taken precedence and are thought of as being universal, while women's desires and what body parts they view as sexy on men are mostly silenced or not recognized to be as sexy as any body part women possess, because women are, as we have been trained, inherently sexual, while men are not.

In general, sexualizing women's nipples while not sexualizing men's nipples creates an imbalance where women are taught to be inherently ashamed of the body they possess because it is automatically ""sexual"", while men are taught that their body is the normal, default body that is allowed to view women as objects for their sexual viewing pleasure.

Whoops, this was a lot longer than I meant it to be. But I'm curious, what are your thoughts on this?

**TLDR:** I believe women's breasts are over-sexualized because we have been socialized to view women through a male gaze which believes women's bodies to be inherently sexual. This, in turn, sexualizes body parts that are not actually sexual. I think it is theoretically possible to desexualize women's breasts in time, when men are no longer deemed to be the ""default"" human and society is not designed solely for men's benefits and desires.

**Edit:** I also want to add that I am bisexual and nonbinary (AFAB). While I find women's boobs to be sexually attractive, I do not think of boobs *only* in that way and I do not think of women as being inherently sexual objects because of their bodies. I would have no problem living in a world where women can walk around with their tops off, because boobs are beautiful in ways that are more than just sexually, and so are women as a whole. I think boobs are a body part like any other, and they definitely can be sexy, but they are not aggressively inherently sexual and inappropriate like we have been ingrained with. Society has an undeniable problem with looking at women as parts rather than as people.",0

If your girlfriend has an abortion and you did not want to be in a relationship with someone who would get an abortion, you did not ask the right questions and get honest responses before having sex.

I'm tired of 'nazi bad, communist good' bull shit narratives, when communists killed far more people than nazis ever could or did even during the same time line and for worse reasons. How about a storyline where it shows how some one became a nazi or some shit, cause it's not out of fucking ignorant hate like people like. Something drives people to evil or wrong deeds where they see it as no other solution for an issue they have. Go over how WWI was a mixed bag of blame and who started it really is confusing to this day, but germany was given the shitload of blame for losing and despite multiple leaders saying it's a bad idea to blame them and punish them for WWI cause there'd just be another one after, left them a toothless, trodden, stepped on pile of turds by the rest of the world that they don't even blame them for. Imagine living in a country like this and seeing it constantly mock you. There's a snapping point where people don't care anymore after being picked on or stepped on for so long and so hard they'll turn to dark actions.

Show why the south has a weirdly french cultural influence and all the reasons why the civil war happened. Slavery and why the south didn't want that to end just there. One of the main thing is that the south had a lot of french refugees from Haiti 60 years prior to the civil war when the Haitian genocide happened, when there was a slave rebellion that killed the french settler army. Then soon after a second genocide where all french women and children included were targets, they went house to house with this.

Go over the basic concept of hate doesn't come from ignorance, it is a reaction to knowledge of things. It is not inherent, it is learned. Don't put some sort of dehumanizing lens of cartoonish evil nonsense on it constantly and understand why people turn to these horrid things. Basic fucking empathy to understand how to avoid it repeating. Every evil deed in history has been justified by the time it happened and the stakes it presented. Every evil deed reviewed by history is demonized or idolized by who ever controls the lesson plan for that day.

Oh, and stop two things in every fucking game in the past: Every 'minority' group getting along fine, and the weirdo progressive main protagonist that thinks the other group of criminals is worse than them cause they're racist/sexist what ever. Every civil rights group has historically HATED each other. Black-civil rights groups hated LGBT as did the feminists, feminists called black-civil rights groups N-word constantly and complained that they let (word) vote before them. Hell, it's LGBT today not because it was chosen like that, it was originally GLBT for how many there typically is going down with the letters, but to stop feminists from hating gay guys they changed it to LGBT. Hell, feminism's proudest thing in american, Planned Parenthood, started by a super racist eugenicists who wanted to open a bunch of them to abort black kids mostly, and looking at their typical locations, they're doing great in that regard for her plan.

The other weirdly progressive for his time protagonist thing. The worse thing you can do is kill some one. Because one dude is more selective/trigger happy when their target is a different shade doesn't magically make them better than the trigger happy ass hole who just kills cause reason. Being selective in who you murder doesn't make anyone worse for being a normal murderer.",0

4369,4370,"A lesson I learned from a stranger on the busThis past winter, I was riding the bus consistently to a new job in a new city. I'm a nurse, and the transition was stressful, and the shifts were long and the mornings were dark, early, damp, and cold. There was a woman who would ride the same bus at the same time as me, and although we never exchanged a word, she has made a lasting impact on me, and I find myself thinking of her often. I wanted to share my experience with you ladies. 

This woman was an average woman, likely in her 50s, with a rather plain face, plain clothes, and sometimes rather disheveled. She often sat across from me, with muddy rain boots, and hair slightly askew from wind and rain. Every other person on the bus was either sleeping, or on their phone, scowling, irritable, and cold. 

But this woman wore a smile. Her expression was always soft, inviting, friendly, and she had a peaceful presence about her that was mesmerizing and downright fascinating. She was beautiful, warm, and kind. She never looked impatient, she never scowled down at a phone screen, she would not look away when I met her gaze but would smile sweetly at me, and I would smile back. We shared these rides together in silence, and I found myself smiling too. I would look out the window as the first traces of light came up through the treetops, and I would find stillness in an otherwise stressful commute. 

Then, as weeks passed, I noticed a shift in my own behavior. I noticed myself smiling at work, among coworkers who were stressed, anxious, and exhausted. I noticed that I could make the people around me laugh, and smile too, and maybe even complain less. My patients seemed to smile more as well,  despite their suffering and fear. I noticed that I would catch myself smiling while standing in line at the grocery store, or while doing the dishes, or weeding. I would smile in the car, when going on rides with my partner.

And as the world has changed through this pandemic, as people have begun social distancing, and fearing not only the virus but one another, smiles have seemed to disappear altogether, mask or no mask. 

Whether you cover your face or not, smile more. Smile for yourself, smile with your eyes. It will change your life, it might change someone else's. It is feminine, it is gentle, it is kind. It seems we need more of that these days than ever.",0

When men are young, they want what they want and convince women/spread the ideology that what they want is the best thing for women. It benefits them here. Themselves > potential female partner.



However, when they have their own daughter, they care about her deeply and understand seeing a woman as more human - this woman is an extension of themselves. Themselves>extension of self>other men.

&nbsp;



And men know deep down what male nature is like, they understand that what they may have promoted in younger years isn't actually the best thing for a girl. 




Now, they change what they promote because now protecting their daughter serves their best interest, therefore promoting women's well-being/independence serves their best interest.

I corrected you on this horseshit the last time you peddled it.  It's not that the utter lack of conservatives proves there is a clique.   It has been *claimed* by an inside source that there is such a clique, and the existence of ONE NAME is all it would take to disprove the allegations. 

And they can't do it.  

>Just as the lack of black superheroes proves that Hollywood is keeping out black people,

1.) The lack isn't total, there have been several black super heroes, and

2.) Hollywood is on the record as constantly bending over backwards to prove how woke and diverse they are. 

Compare that to the games journalists who can't give us ONE NAME and who are on social media continually acting in exactly the ways an anti-conservative clique would in fact act.    If there wasn't a single black super hero in Hollywood and famous actors and directors were on Twitter constantly talking about how much they hate black people, then maybe you'd have a successful analogy.

3003,3004,"In everything in game, besides holding frame, even in which in rare times it must be broken for comfort reasons, you must utilize it as push pull. Eye contact is to create tension, to project energy, mindset, focus. In pick up we use what we call laser eye contact. 

1. Forehead relaxed

2. Eyes low like someone shined a light in it, or you just woke up

3. Barely able to tell that your eyes are open, but enough  to know you definitely are alive

4. Focused on a singular point. A point within that point. Like staring at the eye of a needle. Then trying to find the middle of the eye of that needle. That's what makes it laser

5. You project what you're thinking in your mind through your eyes. If you feel it genuinely, your eyes will assume it

5a. Relaxed, yet loose and solid. Like how you lightly pull a rubberband apart and when you snap it it returns to position. It didn't have to do anything to do that. It simply was.

Strong eye contact implies many things. Dominance. Confidence. Ability to be present in the moment and be relaxed. Lack of fear. But it can also project the desire to be violent. A predator never takes its eyes off its prey. You however know she is not prey. 

You hold eye contact just long enough to communicate the right things, then break it. Like you break for natural pauses in conversation. Push pull. Good feelings, then take it away. The tension comes from them wondering and wanting the good feelings back. 

There isn't a magic formula for when to pull back. You have to feel your way into it and be empathetic.",0

6493,6494,"Mental bandwith to listen, note body language, AND be flirty?I've got a problem with my metal bandwith. Over text I can be very flirtatious and escalate. Then when I go on the date, knowing this is supposed to lead to a hookup, I fail to escalate and make a move because I am so distracted by actively listening to the conversation and paying attention to body language that we have a fun conversation and that's it. She drops hints, but because my mental bandwidth is maxed out, I can't respond to them in the same way I would over text, when my mental bandwith is hardly being used at all. 

I can only do two things at a time, and here I'm required to do three.

* I listen, but ignore body language to be flirty and make moves, but screw it up because it's unnatural and ill-timed (because I'm not paying attention to body language).
* I pay attention to body language and try to make natural, well-timed moves, but now I can't keep the conversation going and things fall flat.
* I listen and keep the conversation going, and I pay attention to body language, but I'm too overloaded for flirtatiousness to enter my mind. 

One of those three scenarios, most recently the last one, have been *consistently* cockblocking me when  I should be already in. All of my successes have been with extremely high-interest women who forgive those mistakes.

3419,3420,"Ooook, so, let's begin.
1. There is a difference betweet starving because of commies and capitalism. In capitalism, you have a real canche to get out of poverty, in commie, no.
2. Commies also start wars so, no strong point there. Taiwan? Tibet? Butan? Hong Kong?
3. Your ""propaganda"" is not real. China is solely at fault for Corona. Look at their culture. They eat dogs, cats, bats, koalas, snakes, etc and thet try to eat it as raw as possible because it is considered healthy. Well, that backfired, did it not with Covid? In this case: eating bats is not a good thing. Some cultures are better than others.
Still on propaganda: I can watch, listen and read pretty much everything in democracy, can even real Mein Kampf if I want, you can buy it but not in China.  Media must he aproved by the gov first, not cool.
The ""propaganda"" that you showed, it is in fact, reality. Sad to break your commie chinese love but reallity is reallity, just like TRP regarding woman. Get over the anger phase.
4. No, cult of personality is not raising someone as an example. Stop toying woth words, you start to sound like an SHW/Antifa. Cult of perso is when you are forcebly shoved in your throat a person. For example: Stalin, Hitler, Muso, Che, Fidel, the Kims of Korea, Hirohito in WW2, Mao, etc.
5. No, it is not bad, that's why we have universal free healthcare (at least in EU), free schools and colleges, police, firemans, housing program, car program.
People are not born and will not be able to be all equals, have same chances, this is by default. You might be good at math but I really suck at it, for real.
You might be bad at programming but I am a sharp tool in programming PLCs in Step7, TIA Portal and also designing electrical systems in Eplan. You and me are by default not equal. Equality in chanses, not really, again. Even with free healthcare, education and all, there can not be equallity. Stop this commie thinking please. Also, people do not like to be equals and the same. Not everyone wants a VW Passat, others want Seat Leon for example or Fiat.
Also, you want to be equal with Elon but Elon does bot want to be equal with you.
6 capitalism creates them naturally and by that I mean rich people just became rich because reasons. Commies just creates artificial rich people.
So you are a starter banker? If you are not in my close group of friends and not commie, nope, bye. The state wants you out of the elite plus you do not seems, subjectively, dedicated to the commie ideals.
Sorry man but you are really losing this discussion. Commie is bad for culture, humanity, science, etc. Whatever.
7. What other political parties are in China? Is there a liberal party? Conservatorist party? And I am talking in EU politic terms (USA is garbage with politics). Nope, only commies and if you do not vote commies, you are a bad, bad citizen, off to reeducation with you.
I am not in the USA sphere of thinking. We have opposition here that fights for it's causes. The democrat socialists were in power in Romania, they did terrible things and wanted to do more like pardoning people accused of corruption, fraud and money washing but the opposition managed to unite (liberals, technocrates, idk if i spelled it correctly, other socialist formation) and together with the people's protests, the social democrats felt. This is an example.
China? Nope, no opposition, no protests, nothing.
8 Yes, I am romanian and collectivisation left a huge wound and scar in our society and for me also. My grand grand father owned a lot of land that was productive, he was working it but when the commies vame to power, he was executed because he did not want to give hi's private property to the commies. After 24 years of commie downfall, my family managed to get back only 60% of our rightful lands.
No, collectivisation is not ok. It kills private innitiative, it keeps people poor, it keeps people in slavery, etc.
Stop thinking red. You are in TRP and you come with all this crap? Obesity is because people do not care what and how much they eat. Suicide rates in males is mostly because they are pussies and not being able to man up. Feminism, how it has affairs in collectivisation?
Yes, I oppose collectivisation so you can call me a bluepill beta male, I do not care. My wallet says other thing and the keys I have on my keyring also say other thing. Ask my lawyer also and he will say another thing regarding the rest of 40% of the missing property that will be gained back.
9. I will not comment on that, it just sounds so SJW retarded crap with social order. What do you even mean by that? Always explain yourself man when you are having a discussion with someone or an argument. Chill, I view this as a discussion and I would like to get more replies from you on this subject.
Regarding my point made for Godlike strict rules: no, I would not like such a system that tells me how to walk, what to wear, how to interract with people, what hairstyle shall I have.
The ""new man"" is bad because totalitarian regimes impose their view. In commie Romania, the commies envisioned that the new man (does not matter what sex you are) must be an engineer, architect, excellent at maths and exceptional scientists. There was no room for philosophers, artists, bankers, priests and other occupations related to those fields. Not good, a stable and functioning society needs everyone. From garbage collector, ticket seller, waitress, baker, banker, broker, aetist, philosofer, priest, stripper to engineers, mechanics, scientists, etc.
10. No, the roman republic =/= chinese republic. Do your homework please. USA, France, Germany, Spain, Romania, UK, Canada, Italy, etc are based on roman republics. China is just a dictatorship, a plain one.
11. No, there are no drones, spy camers, secret police, radar vans, etc in EU countries. In USA maybe, I do not know but in EU, nope. As I stated in this post previously, policits are totally different from USA and EU. Bernie is the only socialist in USA. The rest are conservators that are both in the left and right side which is impossible. Only Bernie can ve a lefty because socialism and communism in left. But again, I do not know much about USA politics. I view USA as being retarded. While the whole world uses metric system, they adopted their strange and confusing metrics in all aspects of life.
Wtf is a yard, gallon, mile, inch, fahrenheid (i am sure i spelled it incorrectly), lefties, righties in USA?
12 Well, if China was so rich like you said, why it did not made a huge national program for all people to have electric cars? Heavely reduce air pollution, ban kid labor, not affording more thay 1 kid in family, etc. Nope, even tho China is an economic giant, it's people are still poor.
Also, Germany's economy during A.H. was strong is fake. Nope, it was not an economic miracle. Hitler knew it and also he said it. That's one of many reasons he went to war, for hi's country not to economically fail in the next 5-10 years after '38. Please, just please, do not throw the ""but brah, da tankz"" because GE was not having that many tanks that others believed and also the tanks were crappy tanks. I would take a Sherman, Stuart, T34, SU, Firefly over any crappy Panther, Tiger, Toger 2, Elephant and also I would take a Spitfire and Hurricane over any german fighter until the jet ones.
13. Well, communism surely failed. It was present in so many countries during the Cold War and then it felt down.
South America, Africa and other capitalist failed countries do not represent an against capitalism point. It is important to see how they failed also.
I can say about Romania. It is a struggling capitalist country because 1. We did not know what capitalism is after 1989 so we are still learning what it is. 2. Our geopolitical position was against it. For cebturies we were invaded and razed by Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Russia, Austria. Can't really develop when your villages and small cities are razed, can you? 3. After 1989, people choosed neo commies and guess what neo commies did, they ruined the economy. Do you want details? I will give them if you want. In 2000, there was another chance. Between a nationalist, racist, commie hater, extremist and a commie hooligan, Romania choosed the commie. Vadim Tudor lost the elections because all ex commies allied against him and started a massive propaganda and spread fear (if he is elected, we all gonna die, executed, at gun point. He will lead us in chaos, dictatorship). The commies feared him because they knew that if Vadim would be elected, all ex commies would be shot, deported, jailed and monarchy would be reinstalled back in Romania under Michael the First.


Can you provide more sources claiming that US soldiers planted the virus in China besides UNZ?

As a resume: yes, commie is bad, no doubt in that and China created and exported Covid 19 by eating crazy stuff, more exctly in this situation: bats. I am not implying or advocating that China should be nuked, attacked with soldiers or anything but instead, China should apologise and take responsability for the situation and also stop being hyprocrites. Some cultures are just better than others my friend.


Edit: you claim to be red pilled but you are against it with commie loving ideas. If you look at TRP ideas, values and way of thinking, well, those things would not be allowed in a commie state for both genders.",0

2545,2546,"Oh yeah, the CCP's ""proof"" backing its claims of America being to blame for the coronavirus?

A Globalresearch.ca hitpiece, with a Japanese account noticing how said article was quoting Asahi, which is apparently known to have received CCP money:

https://twitter.com/Tomo20309138/status/1238337777755811840

And I kid you not. This was posted by ""Spokesperson & Deputy Director General, Information Department, Foreign Ministry"" Lijian Zhao: 

https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238292025817968640

Further skimming seems to confirm that the ""Japanese research"" was inconclusive speculation spun by pro-PRC ideologues into some warped conspiracy theory about an American army spreading the disease. Also, no Japanese scientists were actually quoted at all, as it turns out the Asahi bit was sourced via PRC outlet Peoples Daily.

3666,3667,"How important IS vetting?Hey ladies, I just have a general question about vetting, and the importance of it. I have been reading and re-reading the Surrendered Wife in the past year and a half, as well as listening to Laura Doyle's podcasts. I just get confused because there's so much in her theories that makes it seem like nearly every marriage situation IS salvageable. She even came out to say that she now doesn't agree with the statements in her first book about not surrendering to men in specific situations, like for example addictions. I've read columns where she interviews women who have never even really respected their husbands from the beginning, and they most certainly didn't vet, BUT they applied the skills and they have transformed their marriages. It seems to me that here in this sub there's a lot of emphasis on proper vetting, and that if you don't do that you can't find a real captain and therefore you really can't or shouldn't submit. So, I'm just wondering if there's gray area with that? Doyle seems nearly totally convinced that any situation can be turned around. What do you all think?",0

Understand that emotions, although powerful may not always be rational or about what triggered them. That doesn't make the emotions less important, just that they should be approached differently than logic.",0

destroyed. call me a sexist, misogynist but the history is the bearer of truth
that when power falls into the hands of women/power hungry people, they always
destroy the nations. want an example? look up what indira gandhi did and also
look up the current situation of eu right now. it's simple, men live by logic
and women live by feelings. while i have certainly witnessed exceptions to
this rule, it's generality cannot be argued.  
men have always been the builders and drivers of civilizations, built roads,
buildings railways, transport, drainage systems, working at dangerous
construction sites and other hazardous jobs, going behind enemy lines to fight
wars and many more things.  
but somehow today's world is hellbent on demonizing men and claiming that
women are always good and men are bad. hell even children today are
indoctrinated with this bullshit, as i heard this from my six yr old niece.
there are some mentally crack people which need to be controlled and because
of this, the laws are formulated, implementation of those laws is a separate
topic. it's really important for us to teach our children our essential roles
in today's world that both men and women play, and instill in them sense of
responsibility and habit of pulling their own weight in society. abolish the
social stigma of preferential treatment, and head towards equality like a true
progressive society with your traditional values intact. only then there is

Lockdown ending this week  week 9

Stats: 40 yo, height 186 cm, weight 85 kg, bodyfat 16% navy method, wife 39 yo, living together for 13 years, married for 8. Kids are 3 (girl) and 6 (boy).

Home workout stats: Q&D protocol by Pavel Tsatsouline, usually with a 20kg kettlebell 3 times per week. This week was pussy week, however.

**Readings:**

Sidebar books read: MMSLP, NMMNGx2, WISNIFG, RM, TWOTSM, MAP, Saving a low sex marriage, Bigger Leaner Stronger, Pook. 

Books read that are not on the sidebar: Bigger Leaner Stronger, Leangains, Kettlebell Simple and Sinister, The Quick and the Dead

Now reading: Fuccfiles, SGM

Reading queue: Day Bang, 48LOP

**Shit to own**

*Health:* In his books Pavel Tsatsouline calls the 48kg kettlebell The Beast. In keeping with the tradition, I will call the 12 kilo bell The Pussy. Long story short, I injured my back and switched to The Pussy for this weeks workouts. It happened after waiting in line for a long time with shitty posture reading SGM on my phone. Bad KB swing form could be a contributing factor, or it could be the extreme back flexion required until recently to put my daughter to bed. Constant 4-5 level pain in the very low back near the hips, on the right-hand side, with the occasional flashes of 8-9 when I tried to bend over or get up from bed. Lasted for 2 days and then subsided but did not completely go away. For two days, putting on socks or tying my shoes was a challenge. I pulled out Kettlebell Simple and Sinister, the chapter on hip hinge and proper form with the swing and did all the exercises with The Pussy two-handed. Yesterday did the same, with the 20kg kettlebell. Back felt fine. I decompress the spine by hanging from a bar at least once per day, I do hamstring stretches and try to avoid flexion of the spine as much as possible. I might even go to the doctor as an extreme measure, if all else fails. 

Gyms will maybe open later this week. If so, I will do the first barbell workout this weekend and keep it light. 

Key takeaway: Im dealing with the back pain without being a miserable whining pussy, esp. with the wife.

*Relationship (contains action item from last week):* So I play this game where I initiate at least two times per week and I win if my initiation was good according to me. Actually, its according to my dick  if it gets hard, the initiation was good. I continue to watch out for diminutive words and Im being successful like 80% of the time. 

By above mentioned measure I did one low quality initiation and one high quality, both did not result in sex because the wife was tired or something. But the sexual pressure got to her so during the say she started giving me IOIs and coming to me for a kiss and an ass grab and eventually initiated sex herself. It was exactly like my standard Nice Guy initiations, only with the roles reversed: I asked her for a back rub because my back was sore, she gave me a good enough back rub and then started escalating with kisses all over my back and shoulders, getting naked and grinding her pussy on my ass and hips. I threw her down, ate her out, did a quick 69 where she licked my balls and then fucked missionary. Barely managed to last long enough and she came several seconds after me, which means I had to pump away with the post-cum erection. P.S. Sex makes the back pain worse. 

I had so much fun eliminating dimunitive words, I am going start another game  speak slowly, with a strong tone, eliminate verbal bullshit.

Key takeaway #1: at some point I switched from seeking validation from my wife to seeking validation from random Internet faggots. Takeaway #2: I need to improve my Immersion first before focusing on the D, E, or V. Also, jerk off more often so that I can last longer.

*Work (action item from last week):* this week my company returns to the office full time. I stay till late in the office and focus on clearing the to do list.

*Kids:* I am doing a better job of setting boundaries before I lose my shit. I am also keeping cool when my wife loses her shit over the kids misbehaving. She has a much lower threshold than me.

The son wanted me to buy him a new game to play on his Android. Its a gigantic sum of money, around 10 euros. I wanted to buy it and use it as a reward for some desired behavior. I decided it should not be something he is supposed to be doing anyway, so I think I found the perfect solution: the son now has to demonstrate to me and the wife how he plays the free version of the game and stops playing when we tell him to stop. I told him  in order to buy you a good video game I want to see that you are able to control your addiction. We use the words phone sickness with him.

*Thoughts on SGM:* the #1 thing Ill remember from SGM it the notion that women need sex more than men. It may or may not be true, but its a great frame to adopt when dealing with the wife, as in: I am giving her the gift of fucking.

**Goals till May 19th  next week**

 New: Eliminate verbal bullshit, speak slowly and deliberately

 Get back to 15% BF or below <-- getting there

 Own the 20kg kettlebell  100 reps one-handed in 5 minutes <-- fuck, not gonna happen

 Keep initiating and DNGF <-- going OK so far

 start one of the game books (Day Bang?) and try out stuff on the wife <-- might have to postpone the deadline

**Mission/ long-term stuff**

 Stop giving a fuck what others think, switch to internal validation

 Become a high energy charismatic guy. Prioritize my career and be successful in my current role, which is essentially running a business within the company

840,841,"You might try reading something like Feynmans The Character of Physical Law.  I thought it gave a good introduction to various concepts without just reciting a bunch of formulas.  Have you learned any calculus?  I found I understood some things better when I looked at back after learning calculus.  Beginner physics courses often bypass needing calculus by just giving derived or integrated equations that apply in particular simplified situations, while some get a better understanding by knowing how the given equations were derived.  


Some people also do better when they start thinking about how those concepts apply in day to day life, and are able to get some sense of scale.  This is particularly an issue in America where you might be using USC in day to day life but SI in the classroom.  Mathematically, I can work out that a 10 kg block with an applied force of 100 N should have an acceleration of 10 ms^(-2).  Then think about something you can relate that to, 10 ms^(-2) is about how fast a dense object will fall, 10 KG is a small/medium size dog, or maybe a bag of onions sold at the grocery store, 100 N is about the weight of that dog or onions.  Highway speeds are around 28 m/s, residential areas might have a speed limit of 11 m/s, a typical walking pace is around 1.4 m/s.  Then if you get a question involving a trolley that has a speed of 2 m/s and applied force of 700 N, you can think of that 700 N being about as hard as you would be able to push something and the 2 m/s as a brisk walk to get an intuitive idea what the result should be before you put pencil to paper.  This also helps as a kind of check in that if you make a mistake in your calculation and get a result of something like the trolley weighing 2000 Kg you might notice it doesnt fit with your intuition from above.  

Then again, sometimes it comes naturally over time as you start recognizing patterns in the questions, or you start getting more complex questions and have to apply those formulas in more complex ways.  Sometimes I found my skills grow when I would forget a particular formula while doing a test and work it out from more fundamental ones.  For example, I might not have always remembered the quadratic formula but I remembered enough from reading how it was derived to apply the same process to a test question.",0

I think it's also important to note that girls are in different states at different times. If she's feeling social and wants to meet people at the particular time you're talking to her then she's likely to be more responsive than if you catch her at a time when she's worn down and wants to chill for a couple of weeks.

of his character and ultimately idolized him , if it ended in a tragic way and

Study"" . To say the truth Kabir Singh is an absolute idiot who has no control
over his life. On the other hand movie like ""Taxi Driver"" actually exposes
effect of loneliness , frustation of repressed masculinity , toxic outburst
and most importantly effect of his actions i.e. his girlfriend leaves him and
his attempt to commit suicide, moreover it's not shown as a love story.",0

My major contention is with the idea that we should avoid working on one area of inequality because it is currently in tension with another area - expressed here as the concept that the disparate impact of childbirth and rearing on women should affect our decisions on conscription. This kind of ""tit-for-tat"" inequality, where the argument is that equality of a sort can be reached by a balance of inequalities, is in my opinion a barrier to progress. Refusing to accept a balance of inequalities does, however, mean we must be careful in our prioritisation of our efforts.",0

3856,3857,"Musings on a MSM's journey towards masculinity.Me: 26 years old, teacher, living in a big but not huge city.

I am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity.

I was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth.

I had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago.

Beneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men.

I began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily.

Of course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted.

A turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time.

I came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned:

\- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness.

\- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity.

\- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with.

\- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles.

\- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood.

\- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood.

\- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women.

\- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc.

\- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities.

\- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc.

\- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice.

\- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play.

\- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina.

\- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again. There is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man (or vice versa), buy a house together and pretend to be man, wife, and kids et al., nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we 'love' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us.

\- Masculinity isn't necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys, making lots of money, and being muscular, though for many it is, and will be. Masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible.",0

Over years I didn't forget her. I tried to stalk her but she wasnot using social media. Whatever. Before 1 or 2 years ago I found her profile in a design application and I began to follow her.

To answer your first question, research in the US shows older widows return from grief more easily than widowers, because women are more likely to hold the burden of keeping social networks alive. ([Source 1](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/56/1/S56/546685) [Source 2](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=widower+loneliness&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DBPk5Uv_P2e4J)). When their husbands pass, theyre far more likely to have their network to lean on and come comfort them. What do you think happens to the husbands whose wives arranged their social calendar for the last 30 years?

Toxic masculinity dissuades boys from working with their friends to process emotions. Whereas women and girls *define* friendships by how vulnerable they can be with each other. 

So, men grow up thinking a romantic relationship is the space where you can be open about your emotions. Oftentimes they dump all their lives emotional baggage on their partner, which is bad for the female partner who expects to *share* this work. But worse, how many years can a man go without that space where he can process how hes dealing with life stress? 

If a man never learns the tools to process everyday emotions, and never had a friendship where they felt open doing so, I have no doubt they can turn bitter and violently lash out at women.",0

Particularly for young and naive girls, the porn industry can be so brutal. Few actors are able to make a real career of it, and any involvement leads you down a path where society shuns you. There is no such thing as only doing porn for a few years to get you through college, but that's an idea that some people seem to have when they do it.

3806,3807,"Own Your Shit Weekly - April 21, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

6513,6514,"New Mother Needing Advice On CopingHi Red Pill Wives! I'm really in need of some advice in this very trying time of my life. Well, I don't know if I need advice, a slap in the face, a shoulder to cry on, or just to commiserate - I guess I just need some context. My husband and I have been married for a year and a half and we have a 7.5 month old son. I'm really struggling with the transition from purely homemaker to include being a stay-at-home-mom. My husband works a great job and we have always been in agreement that our ideal situation would have me staying at home looking after our children.

I feel like I'm currently not meeting my own expectations or my husband's expectations of what I should be doing at this point. The first few months were absolutely survival, we both knew that going into it, but now that we've found more of a routine with the baby I'm struggling even more now that there's more expectations of me. The idea that there's zero ""time off"" from motherhood is really eating at me in a way I hadn't anticipated.

I end up feeling slightly resentful and come off as ungrateful to my husband when his job ""ends"" and he gets a break in the evenings. He frequently works on things at home (he'll VPN onto work and check things during some evenings and on weekends) so it's not that he only works during the day and lounges for the rest. However, I get up and cover anything that our son needs between bedtime (around 7pm) and I'll get up anywhere between 6-8am and look after him for his first wake-window. Neither of us are morning people, so I find myself envying my husband who gets to stay in bed until 9 or 10. Partially for the sleep, but partially because he gets the opportunity to stay up late to enjoy his hobbies where I feel pressure to get to bed early so I'm not absolutely dead for a 6am wakeup.

We counter this problem once in a while by my husband taking the first wake-up. I'll get up and feed our son and he'll get up and spend an hour or two with him so I can get back to bed. This is usually a great treat but it's not feasible for him to do it super often and I feel a lot of guilt asking him to get up earlier on a work day or after I know he's been up late.

A lot of things I previously enjoyed as a homemaker (cleaning, cooking, general errands) don't bring me joy in the same way now that it's a juggling act with a baby. Even though I really enjoy making food for my husband, I get frustrated and anxious about getting groceries or meal planning and frequently ask if we can get take-out instead, which in turn makes me feel like I'm doing a bad job. I try and stay on top of the laundry and dishes pretty well, but the overall state of our house is not something I'm proud of. 

My husband is an absolutely awesome dad and he's so willing to be involved and help when he can around his work schedule. I honestly love being a mom too, it's just been really hard that I don't feel like I get to be anything but a mom anymore. I'm half and half breastfeeding and pumping (about 4x each per day). If the baby isn't up, I'm usually hooked up to my breastpump, cooking/doing dishes, or doing laundry. I get a couple hours in the evening where I can take part in my hobbies, but by that point I'm usually so exhausted that I crash and get to bed as soon as possible. Any energy for physical intimacy with my husband is almost a distant memory at this point.

Anyways all of this aside I just feel like there's a normal amount of adjustment to being a new parent, but I feel like I'm on the verge of just not coping whatsoever. I'm having multiple breakdowns a month and I feel like I'm putting a lot of extra burden on my husband.  Is it just going to be hard until baby is X months/years old? I feel some added pressure since my husband is facing a possible big promotion where his workload will increase drastically and he won't be able to help as much as he is now. We also want more kids eventually, but I'm barely hanging on with one as it is. 

My husband was speaking to an older work colleague over the phone the other day and they were discussing a conference that was moving to online. They have evening discussions and my husband said that he'd try and be present once our baby was down for the night. The colleague was surprised that I wouldn't be able to handle doing that by myself and asked what I would be doing if he was having to travel and be at conferences in person. That's been eating at me for a little bit ever since it came up. The last couple of times my husband had to travel for work, my parents came to stay with me to help out (we're in the US and they're in Canada, so they've had to cancel all pending travel for the time being).

firmly believe the male character in Kabir Singh was irresponsible and doesn't
have any reflection with real life or practicality. As you said in the later
part of this video, ""if you're in relationship and your partner is self
derogating then run as fast as possible."" Don't you think this line defy your
Joker analysis, where you appraised/empathize Joker's mental state and called
the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of
person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would
our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir
Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality
disorder. In the movie ""principal"" told the class about his Anger management
issue.
Kabir also has emotional/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him
precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian

>I cant really tell when she wants to me go for it and start making physical moves.

I've learned that they're never going to give signs that they want physical moves. They will only give signs they *don't want* physical moves. If you are close to her and she leans back, she's not ready yet. If she doesn't, you can move to the next step. If she has some kind of accessories on her wrists or fingers, lightly touch her hand/wrist and ask about them. She'll probably be okay with that, so move to the next step. Lightly brush her hair and compliment her on it. If she doesn't move her head back, you can continue moving up. If she does give a *no* signal, go back one or two steps, then work your way from there again. That's basically how it goes.

Now what helps me easing into getting more touchy is creating excuses. If she's wearing heels, take her down a route with some stairs, and lock your arm into hers for ""support"". Go roller skating and take her hand. Teach her how to shoot pool or throw darts--anything that involves touching and moving parts of her body, under the guise that it's not *only* sexual touching. Kinda like innuendo in speech.

One thing I'm keen to try, is at the first meet going for a handshake and instead bring her hand up to kiss it. I live in Japan, and 98% of the female population here goes apeshit over Disney prince/princess crap, so I'm curious how it would play out.

22M. I noticed that I suck at establishing physical connection with girls during dates and fail to show my romantic/sexual interests fast. So it ends up seeing like I either dont like them or I am just not confident to make moves. 

I (more or less) tick other boxes like eye contact, questions, confidence, jokes and teasing etc. But when it comes to physical escalation, my game SUCKS. 

Firstly, I am not a touchy person in general. Even with close friends or relatives, I prefer to go for handshakes rather than hugs. 

Advice needed: 
How can I improve my physical escalation and make intentions more clear during first dates? I am
also careful trying not to kill the vibes if I go touchy and then she does not appreciate it. I dunno how to work on this.

Just cause everyone is asking. Im in the field of law still finishing up my studying though. I like the comments so far. But Ill throw in a more specific example of when this has happened. Ill mention the career field and they suddenly ask what car I drive, type of house I want etc. Another thing is like when Im confident or vague they start saying like yah I can tell why youre in the field. What annoys me is that they are extra inclined to be in my life and suddenly everything I do is cause of my career lol. Its not a bad I guess. But its just off putting cause its just my career. Im really not the type to care about what field anyone is in cause Im not very judgmental. There is a plus side I guess.

6385,6386,"People assume any approach is a sexual approach because it's no longer common to have casual friendsApparently a portion of people below the age of 30 think a man inviting a woman over for a drink is a form of sexual harassment. And this mentality appears to have spread to many fields of daily life; if anyone talks to me it's because they want to fuck me.

And I thought, why do people think like this now? This idea that if anyone of the opposite sex interacts with you there's a high chance they're just interested in getting you to bed.

It's technology and the rise of voluntary self-isolation. That's the cause. Over the past 30 years people in developed countries have learned to spend more time connected to their electronic devices than actually talking to others in bars, cafes, etc. How many people of the overall population spend 3 hours a day chatting with friends, neighbors, coworkers and acquaintances in person? And how many spend 3 hours a day browsing the internet?

Even mundane things like talking with your neighbors or trying to spark a conversation at a bus stop. People, especially younger people, just prefer to stick to their phone, and doing otherwise is often seen as an awkward attempt to converse with a complete stranger. Many folks don't even consider the idea because they have no interest in talking to people around them at all.

[A study by YouGov found that people below the age of 25 had the fewest friends and the fewest acquaintances](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/07/30/loneliness-friendship-new-friends-poll-survey), meaning they're lonelier than people of older age groups. Every new generation appears to do worse in this aspect so it is safe to assume the generation younger than this one, Generation Z or ""Zoomers"", will be even lonelier. And this definitely has been influenced, very likely to a high degree, maybe even directly caused, by the raise of personal devices.

Having friends of the opposite sex that you have no interest in dating or having sex with has become such a rare situation that most people don't even consider that scenario as a possibility. Everyone assumes that if a man shows interest in a woman or if a woman shows interest in a man there must be, by necessity, some sexual interest between the two of them.

In fact, this even affects people of the same sex. It is becoming more and more difficult to present [male friendships without people assuming the dudes are gay inside](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/42/51/bb4251056186c8c04dc36e8a76ce0f97.jpg), to the point where folks [insist that two cartoon characters are gay simply to pitch them together](https://www.thegamer.com/stop-lying-nintendo-cj-and-flick-are-gay/). I have seen this among my friends, both women and men: every time two guys show any more affection than a fist bump or a high five several people comment if they're bi or not. My friends laughed at the 1917 movie because for them two guys being friends during war is definitely a sign they're gay.

EDIT: This has even affected soooo many comics characters like Wolverine and freaking everyone. You have a social outcast, a depressed loner, a dude from another era who has seen all his friends die and hates himself and struggles to even get by and one day he manages to make a friend despite the brutal depression, like Nightcrawler or Bucky or whatever, and they hang out and tell each other their insecurities and drink beer together and... It's wholesome, they finally made exactly what they needed: a friend. And then a gay writer comes along and goes ""This is going to be sexual now, this is now driven by sexual interests instead of friendship or camaraderie. I know it's toxic to sexualize and romanticize depression and suicidal thoughts, but you know what these characters need? Gay sex.""

**Despite the social isolation** and the raise of friendlessness, there is one aspect of life that can never be satisfied without physical contact: sex. People have become less likely to go out to make friends, but more likely to go out to get laid. The impulse to have sex still drives people to talk to strangers and younger generations have become more open about casual sex and approaching strangers with the clear intent of fucking.

As a result of this, if you get approached by a stranger in public, the chances of them wanting to be your friend are lower than ever before in history and at the same time the chances of them wanting to bang you are highest than ever before.

**Change My View**: People assume the worst of any interaction because wanting to make friends has become less common than ever but openly wanting to fuck has become more common than ever.",0

When you say something like this, a girl will by default feel like a loser if she's your something casual if she was raised even remotely decently. (Or even if like your girl, she was raised by the streets and is now wary of guys like you.)  

Maybe you say it because you want to be honest, or maybe you say it because it gets you off to emulate some FR you read on here. 

But realize that the game for a woman is commitment, and by outright shutting the possibility of her success down without supplanting it with a new fantasy (IE: How amazing being casual with you would be,) she ends up needing to do a lot of emotional labor to hamster what she's doing with you.

While I do agree more money should be invested on reducing how invasive the process is (and how difficult the procedure is to undergo and recover from) for people with ovaries, because they are internal organs and testes are external, there's only so much that can be done in that respect as well. I think because of those hard limitations on the potential advancements for oocyte collection, research has focused on making the eggs collected more viable for longer-- specifically because they are harder to get in the first place.

feminism and liberalism when you have no idea of what it is! I am surprised
beyond anything to see the comments supporting your views and number of
followers you have.  
  
Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit
of a common sense are hurt-  
1\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie.  
According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can
just impose whatever you like on her?  
2\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country,
let alone the question of feminism in that scene.  
  
And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned.
For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for
killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be
considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse.

> When China joins the W.T.O., by 2005 it will eliminate tariffs on information technology products, making the tools of communication even cheaper, better, and more widely available. We know how much the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open society. Imagine how much it could change China.

> Now there's no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet. Good luck! That's sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall. But I would argue to you that their effort to do that just proves how real these changes are and how much they threaten the status quo. It's not an argument for slowing down the effort to bring China into the world, it's an argument for accelerating that effort. In the knowledge economy, economic innovation and political empowerment, whether anyone likes it or not, will inevitably go hand in hand.

3585,3586,"The feminist steelman answer is... why don't you men solve this problem for yourselves?

After all, though heavily oppressed, women organized to get this all done, lobbying the government. Why can't you?

And that's a good question. Why do men have such a hard time gaining a foothold for charities and non-profits? Why are both conservatives and feminists so agreed that under no circumstances should welfare go to men? (I have my guesses but I don't know for sure.)

I personally don't know if welfare for men is the answer. But we already have a billion dollars a year in VAWA funding for organizations that care almost exclusively for women despite literally decades of peer reviewed research showing the full picture of DV.

***A democracy is always temporary in nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is always followed by a dictatorship.***",0

just one horror of a human being... And it is sad college goers get inspired
and influenced by such things and get swayed by it and do all these things.
Extremely sad.
