Shes always been keen on having me move in with her, asks around about serious stuff which Ive always just laughed off or avoided all together.

However this morning she hits me with the When are we getting married? bomb. She had a grin on her face and had this false joke of a tone which instantly gave away that she was indeed 100% serious.

Now, Im obviously laughing in my head and I couldnt possibly go down that road so I told her We can do it whenever you want, I just need to notify my other girlfriends and see if they are okay with me settling down.

Afterwards I would just dodge the bullet, but I have a feeling shes always gonna be looking for my ultimate commitment both by moving in with her and ultimately marrying her, which I obviously have no intention of doing.

4266,4267,"Cried in my Zoom Class todayWhy do people have to be so cruel and nasty? I suffer the reverse halo-effect. People always assume that I'm retarded & think I'm weird/ annoying.  I make people physically uncomfortable. 

My class had a debate on zoom today, and I struggled with public speaking (as usual). One girl had her microphone on & she laughed at me when I stuttered for a moment & forgot my argument. Everyone in my class thinks I'm massively retarded, and they will speak over me or completely ignore me. 

During the debate this one guy kept picking on me and being rude/ condescending. I noticed a stark difference in the way he spoke to me v.s the prettiest girls in class. It is pure suifuel, & makes me feel like complete shit

Our professor asked us how the debate went at the end of class. This one girl from my group (who really dislikes me) openly stated that ""certain people"" in our group are ""incredibly frustrating"" and she ""couldn't stand"" listening to them. Those were her words, almost verbatim. Everyone just laughed...but it was clear she was talking about me. There are only THREE ppl in our group. I don't know why she had to be so nasty and passive aggressive. I am nothing but nice to her. I guess ugly people are garbage though & worthy of no respect 

 I waited until the zoom session ended to speak with my teacher about my struggles with class participation/ public speaking. I immediately choked up and stated to cry before I could say 2 words. My teacher just sat there with this awkward smile on her face and asked if I wanted to ""come back in 2 minutes.""

We then had this INCREDIBLY awkward conversation. It felt like I was holding her hostage lol. Even my own teacher thinks I'm a creepy weirdo. I explained my autism & struggles with social anxiety, and she suddenly started talking about how many students find the course material"" unfamiliar"" and ""intimidating."" She couldn't understand why I was upset..... You should have seen how uncomfortable she was lol.

That was one of the most awkward moments of my life. She looked like she thought I was fake crying. I really wasn't though...I'm just that mentally unstable lol",0

6106,6107,"1. Whatever vibration you put out, you will attract 

A lot of you sound like garbage (or just have very flawed, incel like, views/behavior) and wonder why you keep getting trash partners.  Ppl can feel the vibe you put out and I can bet most of the times you come off like a creep instead of a genuine man and thus you attract low vibrational females who cause more drama or have incredible self esteem issues, etc. 

2. Yes dirty talk works sometimes but also a lot of factors come into play 

One of those factors, sadly, are looks. 
And before you give me hate, Dont act like you dont give a fuck about looks either. Ffs OP just rated a girl in these comments. Or  if youre VIBE is right/in check and you dont come off like a fucking creep then youre good. 

3. Calling females bitches and sluts is not ok unless you are close with them and they SAY its ok.  it can be used as a form of endearment. 

You wouldnt want girls calling you a fucking imbecile, cuck, fuck boy, asshole, jerk, prick, fuck face, etc. but if you continue to refer to girls like this, that radiates out and again you will only attract the subpar females that you guys keep complaining about. 

4. NOTHING BEATS BEING GENUINE

Regardless if youre quirky or weird, or whatever else, there will be someone who will match or even compliment that and appreciate you for that. BUT  dont fuck it up by acting the way some of these posts are telling you to act like. 

Also you might think youre a nice guy...but if youre posting here and believing some of these Ill written advices...youre probably not as nice of a guy as you think.",0

First, wrap shirts if youre looking for a shirt and pant combo. Theyre easily accessible and look nice with a top heavy figure imo. 

I like to wear dresses, so Ive been wearing the cami dresses from old navy and gap. The tops are adjustable so I loosen them up and slip an arm out when I need to nurse. The tops are also lined so I can get away with not wearing bras with them, even with white ones. I like the midi style cause I feel like theyre more functional while doing housework, but they have shorter ones too. 

As far as bras go when I want a real bra while Im going out and dont have to constantly pull my boobs out I wear a Demi bra from Victoria secret. All other times, which is most of the time, I wear a bralette. They surprisingly give me a pretty good amount of support. I also just found wireless push-up bras from aerie and Im excited to try those out. I hate feeling floppy but also hate underwire when Im breastfeeding.

Because they know they failed to teach you and prepare you to vet for the kind of men that is ok to be a SAHM/W with.

They know that they made such a poor job that if you try to be a SAHM/W it is likely that you will pick a man that is incapable of doing his part or flat out evil.

And since they still want what is best for you instead of teaching you right from the begginng they take the easy route and just tell you to avoid the risk. They didn't bother to give you the tools you needed to chase the path of the SAHM/W if you wanted it, so they just advice you against it.

3411,3412,"tl;dr: Exercise is by far one of the most irreplaceable methods of improvement and self-love, with one of the best guaranteed return for your investment. Whatever you may think you are, it's better to be that AND fit.

-----

Self-discipline is unique and has no substitute. There is no other way to do something than to just do it. Whenever you feel like not doing what you should, try this: acknowledge to yourself this emotion and then simply *do it anyway*.

The best time to start is twenty years ago, the second best time is yesterday. To address your specific examples:

> I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside

Pursue proper hygiene for your own benefit. It's much better to exist in a physical husk that is clean and smells nice. Also, you don't get another body and teeth aren't going to grow back. Even from a financial perspective you are saving money with good habits. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

> Im on Disability Welfare

It's a tool. Use it to attain the point of the tool: progressing past needing it.

> I have creeped out literally every girl that I have some sort of interest in due to getting obsessive and impatient.

Reflect on what you could've done differently. Try that. Reflect again. Repeat. The only real mistake is not learning from your mistakes.

> Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. 

Bro. Literally throwing money in the trash is better than spending it on egirls. There will always be more women for you out there, there will not be more yourself for you.

Spend the money on your own self-interests instead. Basic exercise equipment, healthy whole foods, clothes that fit, fundamental hygiene accessories, etc.

> I am 130kg

This is one of the most salient areas of improvement right now. You don't need to leave the house to start living healthier. Drink enough water, get enough sleep, eat enough protein + vitamins/minerals, and AT LEAST one hour of exercise a day. Day 1: sufficiently taxing cardiovasular activity (lay down and bicycle pedal if you have to) and Day 2: strength training. Repeat. Eat less calories than you burn to lose weight. You can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.

> I just do not want to be like this anymore. I dont want to keep creeping out everyone I walk past and be pitied like I was all my adulthood.

GOOD. Harness that.

> The worst part? I get panic attacks after hearing crowd noises and applause. This means no concerts, clubs or events. What the fuck am I meant to do here? Thankfully I wear noise-cancelling earphones with pink noise which can let me go to the city without panic.

Therapy and hard work. You can get past that.

You could spend another quarter of a century being unproductive and STILL have more than enough time to turn your life around. You are still at the beginning of creating who you are, the finish line isn't even remotely close to being visible.

The most important thing is to structure this progress. Don't overwhelm yourself with impossible goals and then get dejected when they don't work out. All you need to do is NOT do nothing, even if it's just one thing per day.

Practice 'seeing the world with math'. By this I mean connecting your intuition with the numbers in the equation. 

Take F = ma as an example.

What happens mathematically when m increases? (""m gets large, and either F must increase or a must decrease for the equation to hold"") 

What would that mean in the real world?  (""the ball gets heavier, and if you don't push harder, then the acceleration will decrease."")

2717,2718,"The Riot TR boards post referenced in this reddit post makes it clear that the issue with the lolskin software is that it enables player to use Riot skins that you normally pay for, for free.

This practice is called ""skin hacking"" or ""skin porting"" and is unanimously rejected by the modern custom skin community. At least, it is the case for VoXskins, the community I'm a part of.

The problem didn't ever stem from the ability to use custom, fan-made skins. Custom skins are something that Rioters actually find pretty cool, and modders are usually very involved players. There's always been a gray area and a tolerance towards us, and it is clear that custom skins haven't ever been a legitimate ban reason.

Any person that was banned because they used custom skins were banned because they installed their mods through a software that was bundled with other unfair features. This was the case with MKLoL / MKJogo, which added an unfair advantage through jungle timers (didn't exist in game at all back then). This is also the case with LoLskin: it isn't an unfair advantage but that software hurts Riot's business strongly by jeopardizing their main source of income. The widespread use of LoLskin is what pushed Riot to decide to make it bannable.

Nowadays, custom skins can be installed using clean software that was developed by members of the custom skins community, that aren't bundled with any features that could pose a problem with Riot's business or give an unfair advantage. The community closely pays attention to what is distributed so that we remain in the best terms with Riot possible.

TL;DR lolskin is bannable because it gave you free skins client-side, not because of custom skins",0

I've always thought of myself, deep down in my subconcious, as a beta. No matter what I was trying to do, I was a beta, because I was thinking so of myself.

I made some money... still a beta, cause why not? I somehow fucked some girls... still a beta, cause why not? Worked out, dieted, turned my body into a fucking anciet greek sculpture... still a beta in my mind, cause why not?

No matter what I did, I was a beta. No matter how better I got and how much I advanced, I was still a beta and I was to remain a beta, whatever great achievement I might've had.

**Because I was brainwashed into it!**

This my simple epiphany. We are brainwashed by the society to think very lowly of ourselves, the government wants us as manipulable as possible, so they instill these thoughts in us ever since we're kids.

We, as men, we naturally are alphas, thanks to our biology, thanks to our dick, balls and endocrine system and thanks to our anatomy, we're BUILT BY NATURE to conquer, or at least to relentlessly try to conquer as best as possible.

There's not one single motherfucker out there, who's a natural born beta, there isn't such a thing.

Think of it this way: you start out as an alpha by nature the moment you're born, and your anatomy is there to confirm it. Then, with each passing day, society, friends, family, the government, the massmedia, social media, start fucking with you, a little here, a little there while you're growing up, instilling certain retarded, against your nature thoughts in your brain, which don't benefit you, but benefits them, until you forget your true, masculine, animalistic, conquering nature, thus, you become a little puppet.

This is why you always feel an interior conflict, this is why usually you feel anxiety and depression. You KNOW who you are, deep down. You very well know what the fuck you feel like doing and saying, there's a little voice and instinct in your head that you feel like you should follow because it's gonna turn out good. But just before starting to follow that instinct, you start thinking... ""but what if he thinks I'm a weirdo cause I didn't laught at his joke? Better start fake laughing"", ""but what if she thinks that I'm not a good boy that she can trust, better not tell her how retarded she sounds"", that's the voice of your fake beta that has been instilled in you, taking over your natural alpha instincts.

Retarded ideologies which go against rationality and biology: feminism, gay acceptance, veganism, fat acceptance.

Cheap pleasures such as: 24/7 pornography, junk food, sugar, on demand pointless entertainment (netflix, youtube, tik tok).

Stupid bandaids: anti-depressive pills, pushing any sort of medicine down your throat, getting you addicted to xanax and all that shit.

Mind games: the purposeful lack of certain education, the purposeful miseducation in some areas, slave 9-5 working making you believe you're a champion, meanwhile you're making some other dude rich.

They want you to be a mindless zombie.  ""Don't brag, be humble"" ""Stop judging people"" ""Accept them for who they are"". They want you to have no personality. To be like a falling leaf, floating in whatever direction the wind blows.

They feed you cheap pleasures. Junk food. Stupid entertainment. Crap medicine.  Filling your brain with cheap dopamine.  Keeping you docile, like a tranquiliezed lion in a cage.

You think you're a good man, because you believe in God, you go to work, you get your monthly salary, you fuck your wife and raise your kids, which you do... but you're doing it on their terms. You're not free, you're theirs, until you break out of this mental pattern.

Fuck them.  The only way out of the cage is by forming your OWN opinions.  You don't like fat people? Good, me neither, fuck them, fat shame them until they lose weight.  You don't like hobos? Good, me neither, fuck them, they should go to work and not beg like some losers.

STAND FOR SOMETHING.  If you don't stand for something, any fucking thing at all, there's gonna be an empty spot inside you waiting to be filled.  It's gonna be filled by something else and someone else, unless YOU FILL IT FOR YOURSELF.

**Physical**

Began the ninth (or tenth?) repeat of the 3-month-long Athlean-X program I bought a couple years ago. It has been money well-spent. Having an ""official program"" that spells out what to do every day is great for discipline, and reviewing the prep videos is always motivational. Also there is enough variety and intensity in it to keep it challenging - except I don't get the same variety with just home equipment. Next week we're told gyms open! I've also finished my first run thru the Core 4 Abs program and restarting it.

As part of getting my blood pressure under control the doc had me quit taking Naproxen. Consequently my joints ache all the time. Let's me know I'm still alive. New diet seems to be helping with weight, though, which is good.

**Work / Financial**

About a month ago just as the lockdown started I was transferred / matrixed to two women. I always ask ""what else do you need? What else should I be doing?"" etc. This week I find out one of them is complaining (not to me, of course) that I'm not doing what she wants. I contact her and ask her to tell me which team I should be working with, which of course she doesn't do. So now begins the recovery and ""alignment"" process. More importantly, trying to avoid being fired in this current work climate.

**Mindset**

This work situation is not unusual. There's always some executive somewhere looking for a reason to be upset. The tension is the ""edge"" for consultants. You never want to be too comfortable, you'll miss something. Also you need to continually be ready that any given Friday they can say ""don't come back Monday"". Its happened before and it will happen again. Sort of like the Stoic practice of thinking through the pre-fail or worst outcome as a way to mentally ground yourself.

Shift your focus from abstract ideas to placating to people. When you're talking to someone, always think about their emotions first more than whatever it is you're trying to convey.

He also believes that masculinity as a concept is inherently toxic (I'll get into the details below, he did an interview where he explains why)In case you didn't know, he describes himself as a radical feminist. He did an interview with Vice.com where he goes into more detail on his views on this topic, but I think I can summarize them pretty well in this post. [Here's his full interview with Vice if you to know his view on this issue in greater detail](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/zmk3ej/all-masculinity-is-toxic&ved=2ahUKEwjbmcu_5fnoAhXDTN8KHQ12B80QFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1cB20RqEciXqCreKtu6mEY&ampcf=1). I recommend reading it.

Basically his argument is that traits and qualities associated with masculinity or femininity are just human qualities that any individual might have, man or woman. Men can be shy, quiet, emphatic, etc. and women can be violent, aggressive, prideful, etc. John think's it's unfair that some of these qualities are associated heavily with one gender or the other, and that qualities such as empathy and kindness are universal human qualities that should not be genderized or viewed as feminine. Likewise, women can be violent too, and as such violence should not be viewed as solely masculine. All these traits should just be viewed as human traits. I pretty much agree with this point of view.

However, he argues that the main thing that distinguishes masculinity and femininity (as social concepts/ideas/roles) is that masculinity promotes violence and aggression, while femininity does not. As such, he argues that masculinity as a social concept is inherently toxic, because masculinity promotes harmful behaviors that femininity doesn't promote. Even though he believes that toxic behaviors like violence and aggression are not inherent qualities of men or women, he believes that that traits and behaviors promoted by masculinity are generally more toxic than those promoted by femininity. Still, he thinks masculinity and femininity as concepts should be done away with.

Thoughts? I recommend reading the interview with Vice.",0
4665,4666,"Focusing on self awareness and self improvement in general will put you miles and miles ahead of other girls. Hypergamy is subconsciously strengthened by all the content most women and men take in on a daily basis (like Netflix, product advertisement, big news networks, etc.), so being aware and mindful of that will help you to be avoidant of it. Self improvement topics such as finances, ethics, health, and productive hobbies are a great alternative to unhealthy mainstream content. Strengthening yourself in these areas will help prepare you for real problems and avoid the ""dellusion"" that many beautiful women find themselves in during their 20s before waking up to a nightmare in their 30s when the constant attention stops being thrown at them.

Men who are extremely needy assume that, to be not needy, you should be the polar opposite - completely disinterested. In truth, it's about striking a balance by having clear boundaries you don't cross. Highly recommend you read the book if you struggle with needy behavior. 

To apply this to your example. The girl who wants you to be in touch constantly is playing on your neediness. You obey her because you desperately want your needs met, but it's actually hurting you. You appear low value because you're too available. 

Nothing else more important is taking up your time? No job? No gym? No hobby? No friends? That subcommunicates that she's more important than anything else going on in your life. Not what she's looking for. 

A boundary you can set is that you won't placate women who demand your attention. She can learn to deal with you being unavailable or she can find someone else to annoy.

You'll find that actually this boundary might upset her initially. But, if she's a good person, she'll respect you for having the self-respect and self-confidence and self-assurance to set and enforce a personal boundary. Men who capitulate demonstrate a weak character.",0

3412,3413,"The RedPill on Propaganda in democratic countries from an immigrant from an ex-Communist country using anti-Chinese Propaganda as an exposeeMany in the West claim ""our Press is free and fair and is not controlled by the government and therefore we have NO propaganda!"". I am here to show you how wrong this is. Coming from an ex-communist country, my propaganda detector is well honed. The Propaganda machine in the West is far more insidious than that of a ""totalitarian"" nation. While a ""totalitarian"" nation may blatantly repress dissenting speech and thus make the dissenters look like martyrs, the West - under the guise of free and fair press and under the guise of democracy can shape and influence public opinion and few will be the wiser as there is no blatant repression of speech and thus no obvious tyranny to resist. Furthermore, repressing overt nationalism further aids the propaganda machine, as any anti-country news will be viewed as ""objective"" because it is not overtly nationalistic. But ironically this conception plays into peoples need to identify with a tribe, and people do so subconciously while being able to feel good about themselves that they are non-nationalistic and a fighter for ""democracy"" and ""freedom"".

Why do I write this? Today I have received a blatant anti-chinese propaganda newspaper on my doorstep, from a previously unknown newspaper that is encouraged by the municipal government.

Since we on the redpill are concerned with truth, we should not only be seeking truth in terms of women, but also truths of the world and how the powers that be are attempting to influence our perceptions indirectly. As an unassimilated immigrant it is much easier to see and fight back against attempted mind control, not only because I have seen this in my own country but because I am already distrustful of the culture as a whole.

Attached I present you the first page of this propaganda piece. Not only does the paper present an anti-china stance, it is also an expos on how language is on how language is manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.

It almost feels like we are on war footing, with the level of anti-chinese propaganda occuring and it progressively ramping up. It seems to me that the Western governments do not want this crises to go to waste and are looking to bring down the greatest threat to the Western rule since the fall of the USSR if not since ever.

China is poised on the brink of becoming the new world leader and to wrest control of the world from the United States - if it weathers this storm, I think it will become unstoppable manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like ""70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship"" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.

The Western method of propaganda and influence of the population works in much the same ways that TRP suggests one influences women, through insinuation, implication and plausible deniability - never through direct statement. This is why the Soviet propaganda machine was inferior to that of the US, it operated on absolutes rather than insinuations (at least internally - it was much more effective externally). I recognize this method of propaganda, because this is how the KGB ran its own Propaganda campaigns in Western countries, creating fake papers and journal articles to influence western governments to believe in the possibility of nuclear winter and thus make the idea of nuclear disarmament more plausible.

I write this as a warning to all of you living your daily lives, just as you are wary of women and the bluepill regarding them, be aware that much of the same techniques are used to control and influence your thoughts regarding the political situation in the country. Also, think whether this control is actually in your benefit, because if it was, would there be a need for propaganda campaigns?",0

So what he was asking was if women fart periodically every 5-15 minutes during ovulation so it would be acceptable if the ovulating woman was to have sex.

According to him all he knows about ovulation is women are more likely to get pregnant and they are gassy.

Edit: I should elaborate, I agree with him about women possibly having stomach issues when ovulating, thats what I was discussing with my friends when he interrupted. Its the perfectly timed farting that makes no sense.",0

3897,3898,"Parents who didn't want to have kids - are you happy now?Hi! I have a problem and I need a straightforward advice. I have a question for all the parents who didn't want to have kids and now have them - has life changed for better or for worse? Is it worth having kids? And for all the parents who always wanted to have kids and now regret having them.

WHY do you regret it or WHY are you happy? Be honest, please. 

Me (f28) and my partner (m29) have been together for almost 10 years. Recently we've been having more and more fights about having kids - he doesn't want them and I do. I know you think it's stupid to discuss kids after 10 years of being together. A quick backstory is that when we were dating for about two years, he said to me that he wanted to have a baby with me someday. Over the years he was becoming more and more red pill, saw the negative sides of having kids and told me a few years ago that he doesn't want to have kids (and I get that, there are a lot of bad sides of parenting). The problem is that we love each other so much. We are soulmates. But we know whether we have or we don't have kids, one of us will probably be unhappy. But if I leave him, I know I'll be miserable becuse I love him so much. I also think there is a LOW chance that I meet some other guy who I will love as much as my partner now and who will want to have kids. Me and my partner really get along. I know if I end up leaving him I'll just be miserable.

So I am obviously wondering if we ever end up having kids afterall, how much chance there is for him to be happy. (I'm not intending to get pregnant ""by accident"" because that means I'll be intentionally ruining his life.)

So ... what's your story? Thanks!",0
6043,6044,"I just meticulously measured and hung a 3-panel piece of art that I bought some years back.  I had to make a run to the hardware store for a drywall anchor and decided to grab a growler of my favorite IPA on the way back.  

Hung them, measured, and measured again.  I'll probably have a cold one and watch the latest episode of Billions before putting together a desk I've had in storage.  Of course, this means rearranging the home office.  I'll probably take a break and walk outside for a half-hour and then finish the job.  I'll break it in with an hour or two of studying.

After that, dinner.  The store had ground 80/20 on clearance, so I'll dice up some shallots and make some pan burgers ([Julia Child-style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6ugR74z9M8)).  Cutting the shallots and lettuce will give me an opportunity to practice my shitty-but-improving [knife skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMA2SqaDgG8).  I found a recipe for copycat[ Big Mac sauce](http://secretcopycatrestaurantrecipes.com/mcdonalds-big-mac-special-sauce-copycat-recipes/) and made it last night..  It has been marinating in the fridge since.  If everything goes right, I'll be watching some old K-1 fights or Moto GP races over burgers and beers before the sun goes down. I'll end the night with a couple of fingers of Canadian Club Apple with a splash of Vernor's. Maybe I'll play a few of the old records I found at the thrift store. Maybe I'll just sit in silence and enjoy my thoughts.  

To your average woman, this probably sounds incredibly boring.  No drama, not much excitement... But to the single man, this is a joyous expression of freedom and self-love.

2627,2628,"I'm a bit desperate to find an IDE / Editor tool set that actually worksIt's been now a couple of weeks since I've started learning Haskell.
**My impressions so far:**
It's beautiful.

The syntax is clear and unlike other languages like scala you're not constantly wondering: ""Is this actually functionally pure?"", because the language itself won't allow you to write impure code. 

Anyways, now I wanted to start a larger project and learn about game development with the ""SDL2"" library. 

At a first glance game development in haskell sounds like a great idea as it allows you to write nice, stable and composable functions. 

I finally learned enough about stack, cabal and the project structure to get the libraries installed. I wished there was more beginner friendly documentation, but I managed.

**The part I did not manage to get through, is the the environment / toolset part.** And it's not because I need more knowledge, but I'm finding a LOT of bugs that break something.

**Intelli-J default plugin**
* Best experience so far. Easiest to install, but it does not have a debugger as far as I know.

**Intelli-J haskforce**
* Crashes at start. I tried to compile the latest bug-free version but the gradlew script also crashes.

**HIE**
* Crashes. Haven't gotten it to work.

**GHCIDE**
* This one works pretty well, however there are some undocumented errors that happen with certain default files. For example I have to delete ""Setup.hs"" for it to actually work.

There is veeeery little documentation on how to create a ""hie.yaml"" file to exclude these files.

**Phoityne-vscode debugger for VSCODE**
* Crashes as well trying to debug a .hs file that definitely compiles and runs. It complains about some characters when jumping over to the next function.

I'm pretty desperate because so far I have spent much more time trying to build the toolset than to actually code anything.

So, if you allow me the question, what is the current best editor / IDE / toolset combo as of 2020? Something complete and easy to install.

I really don't want to leave haskell, because it's the most popular ""pure"" functional programming option and it's got a lot of documentation and quite a healthy community. I just need something that works :)

I've always been a believer that being an ugly woman affects more than just your ability to form a romantic relationship with friendships coming in a close second.

Human beings as a whole just don't value you or respect your existence when you're ugly. Any 'friends' that I've had would exploit my insecurities  by either making fun of things I'm self conscious about, give back handed comments, or state ways in which they look better than me ect. They also just didn't value me as much as their other friends. I'd have to message first, always, or risk not hearing from them, ever. They were always curt and impatient towards me, as if I was a nuisance that should be thankful that they waste their time on me.

Because of this I realised a very long time ago that platonic relationships aren't worth my while. I'd love to have a friend but I've yet to find anyone that cares about me even slightly, even the people that seem to be nice to 'everyone'.

character, his downfall to the path of self destruction and final redemption.
Actually for me it's quite an inspiring story. We all have inner flaws and
demons within us and are constantly fighting with them. Kabir Singh became a
victim of his inner demons which led to his downfall. But its inspiring to see
his final redemption after controlling all his inner demons.  
So I request all feminists to have some basic knowledge about films before
trying to criticize. They should watch the Oscar Winning film of Robert de

I've noticed this myself - a huge number of people here (and in other self-improvement/dating communities) struggle with taking that first step and actually starting to work on themselves and fix their issues. It's easy to read everything on here, buy seduction books/courses, read 100 websites, watch other people hit on girls, feeling that rush of dopamine as you excitedly think, ""It's not that hard - I could do it too!"" But it's another thing to actually *do it yourself*. **Taking that first step is the hardest step you'll ever take.**

Other guys feel like it's too late for them, or that they're ""far too fucked-up"" to ever have any hope of getting laid or finding a girlfriend or being in a happy relationship. They'll lurk on here (maybe even comment every now and then), reading everything that's posted, but they'll never in a billion years even consider for a second that they could be out there making progress themselves. They gave up hope years ago; after all, getting laid is something that's reserved for *other people*.

I want to share my story, to show you no matter how much of a handicap you're starting with, no matter how screwed up your life or your mindset or your head may be - you can turn it all around. It won't be easy. It'll take a shitload of work - probably years. But it's very bloody doable.

**I'll give the short version of my story:**

I was extremely suicidal from age 14 to 23. As in, every single day Id have fantasies of killing myself. I lost count of the number of times I found myself in the kitchen holding a knife to my wrist, willing myself to have the courage to *finally fucking do it*.

I was in 2 abusive relationships, had ZERO friends, and my life consisted of nothing that really made me happy. I didn't think any women would ever truly like me (my girlfriend at the time hated me, it was a pretty fucked up relationship - we just yelled and screamed at each other all the time). I had a job for a bit but I lost it, and that was when things *really* got bad.

That job was really the only thing getting me out of the house, and once I no longer had it, I turned to alcohol. I became a raging alcoholic (was drunk basically 24/7), developed a severe porn addiction  (most days watching 8hrs of porn) and spent the rest of the time playing video games. I developed really bad agoraphobia (fear of leaving the house) - I literally couldn't go outside to check the mail. I'd make excuses not to even go to the grocery store - I'd make my girlfriend buy all our groceries, which only made her hate me more.

I hated my life, and I hated *myself* even more. I had no friends, no confidence, no reason for existing, nothing that made me smile. My family lived 5000km away so I didn't even have them. I was obviously depressed as hell about it all - like I said, I used to fantasise about the knives in the kitchen draw, or I'd be crossing the road and I'd see a truck coming and I'd think, ""If I just closed my eyes and stood here right now, it could all be over.""

Worst of all I was completely hopeless - I was convinced there was **no way** I could ever change. I was stuck in this miserable existence and I'd always be unhappy. I told myself when I hit my 30th birthday, I was allowed to kill myself.

Eventually I hit rock bottom when my girlfriend broke up with me, and my family found out how depressed/suicidal I'd been. I had to confess everything - the addictions, the alcoholism, the agoraphobia, the suicidal thoughts, how much I hated living.

My parents were so fucking supportive - I moved back home to live with them for a year. They forced me to go see a counsellor, and forced me to start leaving the house. It was absolute *hell* at first, but I slowly got better at just being outside, then making friends, then working on my addictions. I lost weight (75lbs in total), started hitting the gym and lifting weights (went from not being able to do a single pushup/pullup/squat, to being able to deadlift 175kg). I found self-improvement websites and started getting my mind right, worked on actually *liking* myself, and started building a life I could be proud of.

The last thing I had to fix was my dating life - and that was honestly the hardest thing ever. I went through an ""approach anxiety program"" (google ""Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program"" - it's free) and that was absolute HELL. You end up talking to 1500+ girls over the 6 weeks. But, by the end of it, I was confident enough to actually hit on girls properly and try to have sex with them (even though I was still terrified and shaking most of the time), and I actually started getting laid. I went on OkCupid/POF/Tinder/etc as well, and over time got really good at getting laid on there too.

I've met some fucking *amazing* women over the years since then, including my current girlfriend of 2 years. She's the sweetest, coolest girl I've met - she adds a *hell* of a lot to my life. She's also bisexual so we've had a bunch of 3somes with other girls (about 12 from memory). Good fun.

I never in a billion years thought I'd actually have any women truly *like* me for who I am - let alone have sex with me - let alone have 3somes and wild sex adventures a girlfriend who adores me. That stuff seemed so impossibly out-of-reach for me all those years ago; like a pipe dream I dare not even contemplate.

Most importantly of all, I'm really fucking **happy** with my life. I haven't had a suicidal thought in years, I haven't been depressed in years - every fucking day feels like I've been given a gift and I'm so bloody grateful for it.

I hate the idea that anyone is sitting on here thinking they're a *lost cause*, that it's too late for them, that they're too far gone, that they'll never be able to change. I hate the idea anyone feels like their struggles are insurmountable. Trust me when I say this: **I am nothing special**.

It doesn't take willpower (in fact, I have [very little discipline or willpower](https://killyourinnerloser.com/andy-discipline-willpower)). You just have to start working on your goals a little at a time - aim to just take *one tiny little baby step forward* every single day. Those tiny little steps add up over time, and before you know it, you'll be a long way ahead of where you started.

If you're unhappy with your appearance - start losing fat/hit the gym. All you have to do is sign up for a gym membership, or go Google ""how to lose weight"". **That's one baby step you can take right now.**

If you don't know how to talk to girls, go google ""Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program"". Just google it and read a bit of it. **That's one baby step you can take right now.**

If you have no idea where to meet women, sign up for Tinder and just start talking to girls. I have a huge (free) Tinder guide on my site that covers literally every step from improving your looks, to taking pics, to messaging girls, going on dates, having sex, and even keeping them around for months/years afterwards. Seriously, just install Tinder and just start getting used to how the app works (you don't even have to message any girls yet) - **that's one baby step you can take right now.**

If you're super depressed, google counsellors in your area. Or send a message to a mate, ""Hey man I gotta be honest, I've been feeling really bad lately."" Or send a text to a family member telling them you've been feeling down for a while. **That's one baby step you can take right now.**

No matter where you're at right now, there is always *something* you can do. Some tiny little baby step you can take **right now**\*.\* Stop reading, stop sitting around watching other people find success, and stop thinking you aren't worthy.

If I can do it, **you sure as hell can too.**

4688,4689,"The 80/20 concept is inherently flawed, based on data that doesn't represent the population, and selectively ignores parts of that data that make men look bad.I'm a guy. I like a lot of what TRP has to offer. It helped put words to things I had felt and experienced for a long time. But it's very clear that certain pieces of TRP wisdom have spent far too long in the echo chamber and become dogmatized and mythologized beyond all rational sense as a result.

The 80/20 concept is a prime example of this. I often see it referred to as the 80/20 ""rule,"" and see guys use it to show that 20% of all men are Chads running a harem.

The 80/20 rule is, so far as I can tell, based of a combination of a misappropriated Pareto principle and some very selective data pulled from [Tinder](https://medium.com/@worstonlinedater/tinder-experiments-ii-guys-unless-you-are-really-hot-you-are-probably-better-off-not-wasting-your-2ddf370a6e9a) and [OkCupid](https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/).

The most glaring issue with treating 80/20 as a rule for romantic interaction generally is that the data isn't based on the general population - it's based on data extracted from two very specific dating sites. The best you can say is that it applies on Tinder and OkCupid. That does not therefore mean it applies to the general population. A small percentage of the population use these apps. They are a product. They attract a certain kind of person, often for a specific purpose. Tinder dynamics =/= dating dynamics.

The Tinder study is so flawed it's hardly worth looking at. It's based off the self-reported data of 27 women. 27. Millions of women on the app, and only 27 were interviewed. So beyond not being representative of the general population, that study isn't even representative of Tinder.

The OkCupid data is a bit more solid. What does it show? Well there are a few things to note:

Yes, it appears women on OkCupid are pretty brutal in regards to how they rate the attractiveness of males. 80% of men on OkCupid were rated as below ""medium"" attractiveness. But again, this isn't an analysis of dating in general - this is an analysis of how women on OkCupid rate men on OkCupid. It's possible that women on OkCupid are just pickier about looks compared to the general population. It's possible men on OkCupid are just uglier than the general population. It's possible they just aren't good at dressing, grooming, and taking good profile pictures (and having looked over the shoulder of female friends as they swiped, I can confirm there's a lot of dudes who probably look pretty decent but absolutely suck as presenting themselves well). 20% of men were rated as above average. I've often seen this ""study"" used to confirm that 20% of men ""get"" 80% of the women. That's nonsense. And here's why:

What TRP conveniently omits from this analysis is that while the women were pretty brutal in terms of who they rated as physically attractive, women also largely went on to initiate contact with that same block of men they just rated as physically below average. Look at the graph. In terms of who women are actually willing to pursue they basically the opposite of picky in regards to looks. Arguably this is evidence that women are *not* particularly shallow - they have high standards when it comes to looks, but other things in a guys profile - humor, career, charisma, hobbies - prompt them to contact these men.

What about guys (*on OkCupid)*? Well we're much more fair about attractiveness ratings. It's a nice bell curve peaking right around ""medium,"" although I have to imagine the thought process here went something like ""mm... boobs... hot..."" But who do guys (*on OkCupid)* contact? That same study that ""proves"" 80/20 found that two thirds of all male attention is focused on the top one third of women. So why isn't there a 66/33 rule? Well because that would make men look like shallow horndogs drooling after only the hottest of the hottest women who are way out of their league and then complaining when they strike out. It would make men look bad. So TRP ignores it, rather than codifying it as a rule for all human interaction the same way they did with the data on women. Well that's not quite correct - they only did this with the data that makes women look bad. The part that shows that women happily initiate contact with far more than just the top 20% conveniently gets omitted from this ""rule.""

Finally, just on a common sense level, one fifth of all men are not Chads. Think of any time you've seen a pretty random subset of the population, have *one in five* of the men present been jacked, jawlined, charismatic pussy-slayers? No. Not even close. Probably more like 1-2%. And do these men get a lot of sex? Yes. Do they probably get sex from the hottest women? Yes. Does this mean there's no sex available for everyone else? Not even close. A majority of men report having multiple sexual partners over the course of their lives - the 0-1 category is a minority and, considering that many religious people who weren't trying to get laid before marriage are in the 1 category, it's probably even smaller. Only between 12-14 percent of adults aged 20-24 have never had sex. This number drops to around five percent for adults aged 25-29, and by age 44, only around 0.3 percent of adults report never having sex. So if your goal is to be able to effortlessly hook up with different hotties five times a week, yeah, sorry, you're shit out of luck. That's only something Chad (or a very very rich guy) gets to do. But you don't need to be a Chad or in the top 20% of men looks-wise to have a normal, happy, healthy sex life, or even to get laid quite a bit.

But it conveys so much more about the speaker using it in an effort to hurt others than it does those others. It marks a lack of restraint, personal weakness, and little forethought. It marks immaturity for succumbing to that tempting anonymous release of racial hatred. Its a word used by unthinking bumpkins and yokels to mark themselves as such.

Well... yes. Things tend to go wrong if you treat a woman who has any semblance of self-respect based on redpill rules. Redpill is emotionally abusive and mostly succeeds with vulnerable people, if you try it with someone who has self-esteem, it's not gonna end very well for you. Whatever you were doing until that point was clearly working, why on Earth did you try to ""start trying your arsenal on her""? A relationship is not a war. If it is, you should break up.

Stop caring about what the ""Iron Rules"" say and start thinking for yourself. You two had something good, then you started playing games with her, which she didn't appreciate. Do not rely on dogma. Also, do you actually believe Rule 6? 

I obviously can't tell if you've ruined everything already, but if you're willing to admit that you were wrong to play games, you still might have a chance. Apologise and go back to when you two first started. If she ends it over this, you learned a valuable lesson - treat women like the people they are and don't play mind games with them based on arbitrary rules some random dude made up. Good luck.",0

"", I think that is a very BOLD statement! because you are basically generalizing here, have you tried ALL MEN to know that they don't have feelings?! SOME DO HAVE FEELINGS (if that's good or bad I still don't know myself)...

I think this is a common cause of being ""too nice"" of a person and not getting the results you wanted/expected. Therefore comes the frustration.

I, as a young man of 23 years old, am in the same situation. I had a breakup because apparently I was ""too nice"" for her and wanted to commit into a marriage and have children. By showing that I had emotions and that I deeply cared about her, I think I scared her away??!! (things just started going sour after I opened up to her).

After this breakup, I got involved into TRP community and started buying into all their crap... Barely got to the point of hating all women because of their suppose ""hypergamy"" and all the mind games ""they play"" on us men... But after a while, I realized it's all BS. 

It just depends on the people you meet in your life and the way they think/see things.

Let's break the cycle of generalization and hate towards the opposite gender. People are people, some click with you, others don't. Just appreciate the good moments and try to move on.

5346,5347,"Your identity catches up to your actions and vice versa.We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore our habits shape and create our lives and our identity. Our identity does the same in reverse.  

When you decide upon improving yourself, whether you start by eating healthier, working out, cold showers...
you should aim for attaining an identity of someone who eats healthy, who works out, who takes cold showers, not necessarily the act itself.

This is so because, our ego is our biggest factor of motivation for keeping or developing habits. If you perceive yourself in a certain way, you will subconsciously strive to do what makes you remain that way, which is why breaking bad habits is so hard. You are comprised of them (good or bad) 

Most important thing to keep in mind is to have patience and not get discouraged by not seeing immediate results. If you workout once, twice and so on you have to keep doing it until your identity catches up to your actions. When your identity catches up and you are a person who works out on a regular basis no strings attached, then it becomes automatic and requires little to no willpower.

Also don't get dissapointed if you for example have developed a healthy habit of working out, but can't seem to do work/study consistently or whatever else. Each habit requires it's own growing and nurturing, but a carryover effect is real.  Make your life a rolling ball of compounding quality healthy habits and don't go in all at once, start small.",0

You've had a fundamental shift in your thinking, which is perfectly healthy at 20. That being said, he is under no obligation to go along with it and probably won't. You might need to start considering if this is actually the right relationship for you.

Aside from that, husband benefits is an interesting topic. We usually only talk about wife benefits. I would say the following are singular to a husband:

For better or for worse: This pandemic has been really rough on me, on the heels of some other life altering stress. I've not handled it well. Vetting is over, though. We're married and my husband takes that seriously and has been my rock through my stress and tears and paranoia. I have been a *chore* of a wife at times, this year. I would never expect a boyfriend to put up with that.

For richer or for poorer: As your husband, his money is likely yours. Before marriage, anything he buys for you is a gift. Don't forget it and *never* ask for financial help. I actually have a rather long anecdote about my husband thinking I was about to ask for money when we were dating, when it was the furthest thing from my mind. It would have seriously dampened the relationship and he would have refused.

In sickness and in health: It's perfectly acceptable for him to bring you soup when you're sick or hang out with you and watch movie, but he isn't obligated to care for your physical well-being like he would were you married. When I nearly cut off my thumb last year, my husband took off work, rescheduled his call shift, picked me up as my emergency contact, drove me across the city to get stitched up under worker's comp, and stopped to get Chinese food on the way home for me. That is pretty above and beyond and while it would be nice of a boyfriend to do it, I'm not sure it's fair to expect it. The same goes for running out to get medicine or cleaning out the trashcan after you've thrown up.

The mundane: Sharing household chores and responsibilities and daily routines really muddies the water and it's why I caution cohabitation. My husband is in this for life, so cleaning my hair out if the drain is part of that, as are all the other gross parts of living with humans and the pets we share. I would never expect a boyfriend to take responsibility for trimming the dogs' nails, putting up the Christmas lights, chopping up the Christmas tree for firewood, or getting our oil changed. Those are husband tasks, as are the many little chores we've decided to split between ourselves.",0

I also care a lot about social equality movements. So I recently got a jean jacket and decorated it with different patches. Two of those patches were a Rosie the Riveter and Feminism patch. One of my friends said it was kinda cringe that I had them on there because I wasn't a girl and it comes off as ""white knighty"". Which makes me feel weird about having them on there. I thought it was important to show solidarity with the feminist movement because I grew up with a sister and its been amazing to see how its affected her and the woman she's become because of it. I truly believe in the cause and have been involved with the cause for a long time now.

>Feminists dont agree on every point regarding gender disparities. Pasquerella, for example, is not troubled by the lopsided overrepresentation of women in nursing, she said, because there is no evidence men face stigma or discrimination in that field.

I find that hard to believe. I mean, it's anecdotal to be sure, but I have friends and relatives that have gone through nursing programs, and this wasn't their experience at all. It was actually akin to the worst stories that you hear about women in other courses. 

> A paper she co-authored for publication this year -- Choice of Majors: Are Women Really Different From Men? -- reports that girls respond to a variety of influences and are more likely than boys to change majors when they get poor grades in STEM classes. Ironically, female-only programs may diminish their interest and confidence.

Truth is, this is a culture that I think really stands out of if you look at it, and there might be something there there, in certain STEM courses. ""C's get degrees"". ""What do you call a doctor that barely passed their tests. Doctor"" and so on. 

I actually think there's something to be explored here, and that this might be where there's a very real socialization gap. The problem is it's not sexy to talk about. Girls and Women tend to place a higher intrinsic value on grades. And then changing it....again, not something we're comfortable talking about. 

My position is clear...I believe that these barriers exist far less in different environments. It's why I encourage things like commuter schools and online learning. If discrimination is a problem...IMO these are the things we can best do to directly address it. But that stuff is probably off the table.

But I think this sort of results-driven hammering? I don't think it's sustainable, for that very reason. It's too self-contradictory. Unless we're going to straight up say OK, things are going to be draconian until we get to statistical equality, deal with it....but even then, honestly, that's just going to create fights over who gets to be the target of said draconian measures. Who gets set on fire to keep other people warm?",0

Thestory kicking off with the hero being falsely accused of rape was especially controversial, with many seeing it as being at odds with the zeitgeist of the #MeToo movement, if not wholly opposing it. This led to many Western fans in particular criticizing the series for its casual misogyny, though the sentiment was significantly less felt in Japan. Regardless, though this plot point is played for laughs, many felt that the confines of a fantasy isekai might not be the best place to handle such a serious topic.

About a month after I blew it with the Filipina chick, I ended up meeting a brunette that was a solid HB9. It was at an upscale cafe I frequent every now and then. Since I emphasize common sense, I didn't walk up to her and say ""holy shit I want you to ride my dick until it looks like a deflated pepperoncini"" but I played it cool conversationally until it was time to bag the number, without any hesitation or planning I said...

Just as an example, there's the example that men are more likely to have physically demanding jobs and to be injured while doing so. If injured working men are being undersupported by society, it's possible that that's rooted in a belief that working men are disposable, and that's something we should challenge not to make people feel ashamed of implicit biases they have, but to solve problems for working men.",0

:

When most people hear this they automatically think I mean a girlfriend, fianc or wife. While I think having a partner is important to being happy & full-filled it's not the only important relationship.

A solid relationship with family, high quality friends, and even a strong relationship with yourself are extremely important. The dynamics I've create in each of these have been the backbone to my success. Having people I can count on, people I can learn from and people who raise me up.

:

It took me longer than I'd like to admit to handle this area of my life. I was perfectly content just coasting by with little effort for a few too many years but I decided at some point that I wanted more from myself. My parents didn't work as hard as they did for me to make an average income. Being financially free has allowed me to not only re invest into myself and my business, but also eat where I want, stay where I want, travel where I want and buy what I want. Life isn't only about working hard but also enjoying the fruits of your efforts.

:

Split into 3 parts:

Garbage in = garbage out. I used to love shake shack. If I could have it more than once a week, it would be a no brainer. Problem is I was always tired, slow and lethargic. I would need naps just to get through a day. As soon as I started to care a little more as to what I put in, I had more energy than ever before, and I stopped getting sick. Now? I can't even stomach a shake shack burger even if I tried!

Working out and getting in shape. While I'm no bodybuilder, I'm always working to improve my body and take care of myself physically. If I look good, I feel good.

Rest.

For some reason we've all been sold on the ""KEEP GOING TILL YOU DIE"" mentality. We forget how important rest is for the body, for the mind, for ourselves in general. If you don't take some time to rest your body will force you to do so. (I was so overworked last year that I collapsed in an elevator and smashed my head due to this 'keep going no rest' mentality, wasn't fun)

:
Educating yourself on a continuous basis. Reading books, meditating, learning how to be in control of your emotions when need be (not over reacting) but also being able to express them and experience them when need be. Your mind is capable of more than you give it credit for. If you take care of it, it will take care of you.

      :

Being able to drop your ego and being able to say ""I don't know how to do this, maybe someone can help?""

For a large majority of my life, I held myself back because I was too proud to ask for help. I kept telling myself that I'll figure it out somehow. With that attitude my progress came to a stand still. For years I was lying to myself, till I finally said ok maybe I can use some help. As soon as I did that, every area above accelerated. I had momentum and success in more areas than one and I was able to achieve things I previously could only dream of. Sure I had to invest money to do so, but the trade off vs the results I achieved was a no brainer.

There are people out there willing to help you, you just need to reach out and ask.

Hope this helps

One was a virgin in his 30's when he first started seeing me; he's since gotten laid about 5 times now (over the course of a year).

Gym - you seeing a trainer or a coach? I can't say that I ""earned"" my gym gains (I mean obviously I did the work) - 95% of the credit goes to my weightlifting coach though. I'm a lazy bastard so I literally just pay him to force me to workout - there's no way in hell I would have gotten strong without him. So many days I've said ""I don't really want to work out today, Dave. Can you yell at me and make me do it?"" and that's exactly what he does.

You're doing it on your own! Realistically, it's an absolute slog (no matter how much you love it). Can you get some help from your mum or mother in law, or a friend, or a neighbor?

Diet goal is to hit sub 12% BF during the Time Of No Lifts, sub 15% BF by end of #60DoD.

I'm eating healthy and 1000+ below my TDEE, OMAD except one or two days a week after morning workouts, protein is staying up at 1-1.5g/lb body weight per day, but my body seems to have decided that it wants to stick at 192lbs. I've lost 15lbs in the last 6 weeks but I've got another 12lbs to go to hit sub 12% BF and 7lbs to hit a true sub 15%. I'm about to go back into full Keto OMAD as I'm frustrated with the stall, I'm basically looking for some advice from guys who have done quick cuts like this 60 day one I'm doing now. Do I just soldier through with the low calorie count? My primary concern is to finish dropping this fucking fat and meet my BF% goal. If I lose a little muscle as well, fuck it, I can build it back better later from sub 12%.

###Financial

I will find and buy a nice pair of shoes. 

###Professional

""I will update my resume with my new experience in preparation for promotion opportunities.""

I've put together a list of what I've accomplished of significance over the last 3 months to be refined into my resume. 7 things that those responsible for selecting the promotion would appreciate in a candidate.

###Social

I got halfway through writing out a mini FR for each date, and then realized the dates themselves don't matter. The girls don't matter. What does is what I learned about myself from them. 

I learned that me being ""me with MRP"" works just fine, most women eat that shit up, and those who don't seem to be unbalanced in some way, or else I showed too much weakness and they smelled it. 

I learned that I can more and more frequently think fast enough to frame myself positively while in the flow of conversation without lying, and if I can't I can change the subject, STFU, or AA AM PF. I'm learning that most of that I do automatically, its not a ""thinking it through"" kind of thing. You either do it or you don't. It's got to be natural, not forced. If it isn't, STFU.

I still talk way, way too much. 

I default to comfort/Beta behaviors so I have to constantly keep my focus on creating DHV/Alpha display opportunities and on that mindset, because the Beta comes through on its own. I also am successfully eliminating many low value Beta behaviors and sticking to more ""oakish"" and higher value ones. 

My attitude with these girls now is basically ""I'm interested in learning a bit about you to see if I think there's the possibility for more, but IDGAF if you reciprocate, and if you misbehave, bye because I've got better shit than this to be doing, this is for fun *for me*, and there's literally girls who wish they were out with me/talking/chatting tonight instead of you"" (this is not something that's spoken, its just my attitude. I'm not rude but I'm pretty clear about covertly signaling that they have stiff competition and about not caring if they like my personality or not)

###Mental

MRP fixes the man, and I've decided that I am a man worth the effort to fix. Even with how little work I've done so far, I have value. I am my prize no matter what anyone else thinks about how I'm living my life or the choices I make. Fuck who I let myself become with my ex, that guy was a butthurt dick who blamed everyone else for how his life was turning out. I'm better than that. The past is a lesson that doesn't define who I am or will become. 

*But* - that guy doesn't ever disappear. He's always there, waiting for me to get tired or lazy, so he can take over again. He mocks me with catcalls of ""its so nice to just relax and not be so *busy* all the time "" ""this soda is delicious, especially when paired with these French fries "" ""this videogame/movie is awesome! So glad I decided to spend hours of my life on this "" He is constantly testing my resolve. 

There is a ton of work to do. I have drive and high standards for myself, but like everyone else I avoid the hardest internal work and seem to be at my best when focused on one or two areas at a time. For the last 3 months that focus has been work and has now shifted to work and plating. 

I've been attempting to establish my career and my ""single life"" at the expense of my most critical internal work and my children. The first is not such a bad thing, a short term push for long term gains, the second I still feel has been necessary to figure out what I need to be focused on internally, I get constant data about my mental state from how I react to women. I've also needed the external motivation in my current frame-less faggot mode of being... That being said there hasn't been any wasted effort, just lessons, and groundwork laid for next steps in my journey. 

###Marriage

I've been making STBX calm down 3yo before bringing her to me for bed on my nights if 3yo isn't already with me as I wind down, because STBX lets 3yo stay up while she plays video games on STBX's nights, despite me telling her she needs to give 3yo a reasonable bed time. 

I'm not dealing with the fall out of her poor choices, she can fix it herself and give me a reasonably behaving child, not a tantrum throwing mess getting dumped in my lap at 9pm when I'm going to bed so she can go visit Chad.

###Family

Playing with 3yo more regularly, engaging her and being present. 14yo I am playing a long game, most times when I get home she is playing online with friends. I offer to do things she likes, so far only once has she taken me up on the offer, but I'lltake it, and we both had fun. I'll seek to build on that experience. I also drag her outside on weekends, even if just for lunch in the backyard with my parents and a bit of play with her sister on the swing set. She ""hates it"" but has fun once forced away from the screens inside the house with a moment to adjust her attitude.

###Goals

Don't let on that I know about STBX indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (16 week streak)

Plating OPSEC (4 week streak)

Go to at least one Social activity without family. (5 week streak)

Approach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (11 week streak)",0

2814,2815,"What people don't realize is that if Kabir Singh made you feel uncomfortable,
it was supposed to. It did exactly what it set out to do. With Arjun Reddy and
now Kabir Singh, the director Sandeep Vanga is only exhibiting a different
kind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist
who's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey
rather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his
perspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right,
wronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the
same basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the
movie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That
it's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny.  
  
  
Throughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost
feeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by
his self-inflicted agony. Vijay/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this
torment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues
till the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any
kind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn
by finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't
find anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way
glorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and
repulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his
lifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as
a person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering
misogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message
instead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You
literally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting
characters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while
trying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact
a very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed
man, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch-
black. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a
positive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the
rock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at
his lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered
a personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the
choice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for
eternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus
the film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of
its runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life.  
  
For all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said
earlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and
technical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience.  
  
  
I wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with
an open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially
since this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to
distort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when
they are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like
Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society.

adult population are still illiterate which constitutes more than 50% Women
who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time

The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC
and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions
added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process.  
You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart and

Not in a I want x outcome and therefore should do Y but really I dont give a shit about what anybody thinks, I did give a shit what they think. 

I clearly do not think Im the prize and still want women to want me. 

**Breaking Free Activity 15:** Identify emotional pukes. 

* Withdraw/sulk 
* Threaten to leave when I dont want to
* Get angry with them
* Escape fantasys 
* Ruminate and talk about what a shitty person they are
* Get sad/down

**Breaking Free Activity 16:** Put yourself first 

Hard in the circumstances, however I have noticed I consider other people a lot, especially ex in the mediation negotiations. I am just noticing these feelings and what comes up around it. I am trying to do a few more things just because I want to and again, noticing the feelings. 

**Breaking Free Activity 17:** Examples of how you used coping mechanisms in childhood/adult life for a smooth and problem free life. 

I didnt want to do this one but Im very glad I did. 

* Doing it right: In childhood I wasnt naughty I would follow the rules and do what was expected of me. As an adult I have to get things right, I have to do each part of my life correctly. 
* Playing it safe: As above for childhood. As an adult I dont do some of the things I want to do e.g. start a business/NGO, I take the safe and easy path e.g. current career. 
* Anticipating and fixing: as a child I would anticipate what would make teachers happy and do what they wanted rather than what I wanted to do. As an adult, in relationships, I anticipate what they might want and try and fix their problems for them. I feel responsible for other peoples happiness. 
* Trying not to rock the boat: as a child I was meek and quiet, I tried to please others, I never wanted attention on me. As an adults Ill often smooth things over with people particularly in relationships. I want to call someone on their bullshit but I dont to avoid causing problems. 
* Being charming and helpful: childhood  Im not sure if I used this one. Probably the helpful, as an adult fuck I love being helpful. 
* Never a moments problem: childhood basically the same as many of the others. As an adult, I try not to have any needs to avoid causing any problems, anything you want. I remember the first thing I did when I started lurking (fuck I should have just started OYS) was start to have an opinion, yes actually I do want the steak over the chicken for dinner. 
* Using covert contracts: childhood, not entirely sure, I think I used the if Im good, Ill get love and affection reasoning and wont feel abandoned. As an adult I use them all the time, if Im the perfect partner Ill get the love, affection and sex I want. I use them a lot, I try to be something of value to other people and in exchange Ill get their friendship or whatever. Im trying to just be more authentically me, and great if they like it but its ok if they dont too except that secretly its not ok they dont like it, I want them all to like me. 
* Controlling and manipulating: as a child I have vague memories of needing something to be sad about, I couldnt just be sad and ask for affection, I needed a reason. Not sure if that really goes in this category, as an adult I fill the same way. I need to have a reason for wanting or feeling anything. 
* Caretakeing and pleasing: childhood, if I pleased my parents I get love. As an adult, if I take care of everything and pleased my partner, I would get love, affection, admiration, sex and kindness. 
* Withholding information: as a child I remember feeling a lot of shame and like I had to hide things to be accepted. As an adult I feel the same but to a lesser degree, I hide mistakes and perceived flaws. 
* Repress feelings: Childhood, anger, strong emotions were not ok, you just got over them on your own and then everybody pretended nothing had happened. As an adult, I repress a lot of emotions, anger, sadness, shame, sexuality, aggression, hurt, fear, love 
* Making sure other people dont have feelings: not sure in childhood. As an adult, I treated the emotions about an issue the same as the issue itself. I would say/think The situation is xyz and therefore your feelings are wrong. I am scared of other peoples emotions. 
* Avoiding problems and difficult situations: as a child I avoided competition because it make me nervous and I avoided trying at things in case I failed. Basically the same as an adult, I also avoid problems in relationships.",0

But as someone said a couple days ago under a post in the main sub, after being locked down for so long, you can't keep yourself busy the entire time. I'm currently revising all of my school books for the fourth time since the lockdown started, I've literally watched all the series and movies that interest me, my workouts take one hour if I drag it out, and after another hour of reading books I get tired of it. I was actually able to compensate this by playing ridiculous amounts of Call of Duty (I know it's unhealthy, but hey, at least I didn't catch oneitis during the first weeks of the lockdown due to it), but my PC broke down six days ago.

3133,3134,"One thing you have to know is that there is a fundamental flaw in this question - ""What do women want?""

The flaw is this -- Every single man who ever asked this question is operating in a woman's frame, with her as the goddess whom he's trying to learn to please. And as we know, women don't have much of a frame at all. That is the source of the confusion. 

As for the much more useful question ""Who am I, the man?"", it never occurs to the average man to ask himself that, let alone answer it. His self awareness is limited to the knowledge that he's got a dick that has begun to work for more than just pissing, that his heart rate is a little higher and maybe his navel's tingling. I doubt if the thought even arose that yes, he is indeed a man... 

Which doesn't help him have a frame of a man in the least, let alone a life worthy of a man. 

It takes men a long way down the road to realize that even if they are doing everything else right, they are still not operating in their frame yet, but trying to find hers. That is more subtle stuff, not as easy to spot as skin and bones or a pot belly, or that you don't even know how to talk to a girl -- but it's the root of the problem. It takes even more experience to learn all the ways in which we're still subconsciously doing it. 

If you have properly gone through the trp factory, when you come out the other end, you should have an honest answer to ""Who am I as a man?"" and ""What kind of woman do I want? ""

And even then, growth and learning never end even for the best of us. We just learn to find out own way and make our own contribution from there.",0

1817,1818,"I'm confused by this post. For starters - Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot""? She's an attractive skinny white blond woman who spends her internet time trying to get people to shit on shooting survivors. I guess ""hot"" means looking like idiot mean girl Tomi Lahren?

All of these people style themselves based on high school mean girls and Ann Coulter.

  They're all minions of disgusting right wing mouth breathers who secretly wish we lived in ""Handmaid's Tale"" Gilead, rape was legal, and it would probably be legal to murder ugly women or women and little girls who protested rape with impunity.

She **does** deserve it. No offense OP - but the woman you're posting is right on target, if what she's saying is true.  Fuck Kaitlin Bennett. I enjoy when misogynistic women reap what they sow. You think they're allies? They're not. They're not worth spilling tears for either. And I'm saying this as someone that finds the left as creepy, looksist, and secretly often as misogynistic as the right, so long the selected target is white (maybe Asian), cisgender - shit, even a lot of their attacks on men frequently strike me as fucked up and underwritten by ulterior motives totally divorced from any real, sustainable concept of justice, logic, or interpersonal accountability. Caitlin Jenner - who spent her pre-transition life as a right-wing jock with no interest in problems for women or sexual minorities and apparently has the same politics now, theoretically at her own detriment (but not literally of course - she's rich) - being lauded as a heroine is proof of that, frankly.

I'm just sort of at a loss as to how Kaitlin Bennett isn't ""hot"" but I don't give a shit if misogynistic women reap what they sow. Fuck right, they deserve it. They're agents of the men who want to put their favorite hookers in cabinet positions (Berlusconi), make rape legal, illegalize any medication or health procedure women need to participate in society as equals/control their own reproduction, and create a right wing theocracy. 

No sympathy.

Also - whoever this LivPosting is, she's not actually a hot chick or any ""hotter"" than Bennett; she strikes me as an average looking woman calling out a blond bimbo wannabe for supporting an ideology that leaves ""not hot"" chicks out in the cold, so...I dunno, what is the point of this post again? 

This woman isn't justifying looksism, she's pointing out the consequences of hypocrisy and being felled when you charge for misogyny and misogynistic ideology while female. Do you not see that? Are you offended because of your politics (in which case, I guess I should apologize for speaking so frankly) and the apparent anti-woman mindset of this Liv Posting? 

Are you really caping for hateful anti-feminists like Kaitlin Bennett, who are even less sympathetic to femcels and ugly women than even shitty corporate ""liberal"" feminists who are as focused on virtue signalling for a paycheck as anything else (like our wonderful friends at Mel Magazine, who have such contempt for the women here they'd lift their posts without asking) and have no empathy for real women if they have a self-serving goal in mind? 

The whole point of these posts is that Kaitlin Bennett supports a misogynistic society where looksism and sexism used against women is embraced. She's a (horrible, hateful, stupid, famewhore) woman without a country.

I'm sorry if you're conservative and that's why you're irked here.


Right and left - be it vocal, performative antifeminism voiced by babes of Fox primetime, Tomi Lahren, Meghan McCain, and Bennett; or highly visible corporatized ""feminist"" values presented by shitty faux-""woke"" startups that are revealed to treat their employees like garbage/shitty ""content"" spewing blogs like Mel, at al are mostly predicated on two things, two gods they worship in kind - self-serving engagement numbers, and money. So they support quashing labor laws and fair wages and fair medical leave and HRs that actually treat sexual harassment seriously and, in Bennett's case, try to jumpstart a career by inciting people to wish murder on high schoolers that watched their friends die, wearing AKs as accessories. On top of whatever right wing woman-hating horseshit she's promoting while hustling for a speaking engagement on the neocon airwaves.

Those antifeminists are the ultimate pickmes and only support feminism (for themselves, primarily, and perhaps women exactly like them) to justify...anti-feminism. To justify pushing the overturning of Roe v Wade. To justify ""my choice is a feminist choice because I have a vagina! (There's no such thing as marital rape! Let's murder gay people and burn witches again! Rah rah rah! Let me show you my tits!)""-style feminism, from their seats of influence, their soap boxes and promotional events. 

They're all united with one idea in mind - so long as I get mine (get my abortion, my featured piece, my seed funding, can roast other women alive for deserving to be harassed/raped, can use a shitty hashtag phonily presenting any incident where a woman is victimized, polarizing men and woman in the aftermath or something like a high profile revelation of a sex crime) - fuck everyone else. Fuck facts. I want the spotlight.

He's not saying that every trait seen as masculine is toxic, but rather that the need to feel secure in a constructed male identity leads to devaluation of women, and that traits should be evaluated by the standard of what makes a good person rather than what makes a good man or woman.

Edit: I do describe myself as a masculine person, but that has nothing to do with seeing myself as male (I'm a cis woman).

 **Work**: 4

I am not in school now. Tinder doesnt work for me anymore. My current job has no attractive females.

I am a decent looking dude and understand the many concepts of seduction and attraction. However, with the only three areas that Ive had success with women out of the picture, Ive got no clue where to meet women to end this dry spell.

Im not depressed about it or anything, I actually really value my time alone. I just think its time to smash some walls or maybe put myself into a position to have a selection of girls that I can choose from to have a intimate relationship with.

This is an extreme example but consider Harvey Weinstein - the few women who did report him early on lost their careers because of the power he held in the film industry. Other actresses who *definitely* were aware of his behavior continued to work with him because if they also spoke out about it theyd be blacklisted as well. A smaller version happens within social circles.

And it can get to a mentally abusive point with Red Pill ideology. 

But stuff that's not harmful like working out, looking nice, coming off confident, and tips to help make a connection with a woman or get her to notice you aren't too bad. Stuff like dreading a woman is pretty messed up though. So the basic tips that are perfectly healthy and just increase your chances aren't too bad but when it gets to manipulation which it will, steer clear of that stuff. 

The ideology, techniques and language Red Pillers believe in and use is designed to warp the perception of men new to the sub of how things really are and get you to doubt yourself and women, see flaws in yourself/dating/women even in normal interactions where there aren't any, and take self doubt and disenfranchisement with dating women and grow and use that to indoctrinate you with their beliefs and turn that into hatred of women. It gets pretty toxic ngl.

Just look at some of the ex Red Pill stories about Red Pill ruined a lot of guys relationships, not just romantic but nuked relationships between even years long friends and family, and at the time the guys thought they were doing better because they were drowning in
pussy, and every time they were sad because things in their life were fucked up, they leaned more into Red Pill instead of realising that it's normal to be sad when you've burnt down bridges with years long friends and your own family and lots of pussy is not going to solve that.",0

Others similarly welcomed the companys removal of the butter maiden as long overdue.  
>  
>How did Mia go from being a demur Native American woman on a lakeshore to a sex object tied to the trafficking of native women?

>Mias vanishing has prompted a social media meme: They Got Rid of The Indian and Kept the Land. That isnt too far from the truth.

3692,3693,"I've never really thought much about this, but I do feel like you have a point. 

Made me think of pretty much any big ""alpha"" male movie character or star. James Bond. Bruce Wayne. All the Pacino, Eastwood, Cruise, Hardy, Bale, Pitt, and a couple of DiCaprio and Gosling characters. Their characters are typically men of few words. Confident. Stoic. Smooth. Stylish. Guys like these can probably have any girl they want, but there is a common trope in movies that they will try to win over the girl who was initially cold to them. James Bond is actually the perfect example now that I think about it. Has less to do with the girl (or guy) itself and more to do with the ""chase"" of winning him or her over. I think another difference is that with girls there's a trope of them wanting to ""fix broken men"" that may be connected to the trope of ""girls like jerks"" but honestly idk. 

However, I think a key point is that most movies and media are usually not a good demonstration of how relationships work irl at all. But there's a distinction to be made. The trope isn't that guys and girls are into people that treat them like shit. The trope is that guy and girls are into people that give them the cold shoulder. Does this make someone a ""jerk""? Not really. 

I've definitely known guys who have straight up told me that they initially treat high-self esteem girls like shit to get them to sleep with them and it actually works. But there's a high level of confidence and nuance people need to pull shit like this off. Albeit, guys like this go through relationships like professors go through dry erase markers so this really isn't the best way to go about finding a meaningful and healthy relationship.

I use this rhetoric a lot when talking to feminists specifically.

*""Why is this the only issue where you think men are different?""*

The problem ultimately comes down to them only ever caring about gender stereotypes when they negatively effect women, while at the same time amplifying negative stereotypes about men (I guess to make women look better?).

get tired soon ,i have proof for everything each and every punctuation marks
in the petitioners petition is lie i even have video and audio proofs to prove
my innocence,rti reports to prove forged documents were filed with the help of
cops to frame me in false cases ,but when will i get the opportunity to prove
it all false? only when the bloody trial starts until then i am guilty ,
""innocent until proven guilty "" is an joke in our judiciary when it comes to
gender biased law's the judge's, cops etc somehow love to torture innocent men

members for these organizations are torturing my family members also ,they are
threatening ,they even threathened my wife before my marriage knowing my
tragic life she stood for me and didn't dump me she was threatened by an lady

And there might be angles in evopsych and sociology that are ""interesting"", just from the standpoint of knowledge being interesting.

But like I said I don't fault women for it and I don't think many MRAs do either.  Some men may be bitter after being taken to the wringers in divorce court.  So it's not like there aren't issues in society that need addressed because of it. But I don't think any man if put in the same position would do anything different than what most women do.",0

Yes, I think a lot of us do this as well, even normies.

> Is this ""maladaptive"", and is there anything wrong with that?

It depends. Like I said, daydreaming is something even normies/NT's will do, it doesn't necessarily have to be bad.

&nbsp;

It becomes ""maladaptive"" when it's used as your preferred coping mechanism for loneliness or boredom (just two examples). Daydreaming might feel nice at the moment you engage in it, but especially the maladaptive kind will take up significant chunks of free time that you could be using to solve the underlying problems that are causing you to daydream in the first place.

&nbsp;

Indicators of daydreaming being maladaptive are for example:

- making facial expressions/talking during daydreaming sessions

- feeling distressed when something is preventing you from daydreaming

- preferring daydreaming over real life activities/socializing

&nbsp;

These are just a few things I remember.

How does one make a man feel like a hero or that he is needed if, well, you dont really need him (in the traditional sense)? I am not masculine or alpha or aggressive at all, but I have had relationships break down because I didnt make my partners feel needed. Both of my two big breakups were with men in respectable, but not high-powered, careers whod been excited about me because I had a real job. Both breakups happened because they said they felt like I did not need them, and I am trying to figure out if it was due to something that I did wrong or if egos had played a role. If I need to play down aspects of myself or if Id just been with very insecure people. 


I do not brag about my schooling or my job or anything like that EVER. It is a lesson that has been voiced to me by many of my female mentors and I am well aware that men do not care much about womens accomplishments, Ivy League pedigree, or professional prowess. If anything, I downplay my career (currently a resident) and background. But the fact of the matter is that I have always worked hard, gone to top schools, and stayed on track. I am not a hardened, un-feminine career woman but I am simply driven by what I do (specialty derm) and am good at it. And I feel like I am being penalized for having high income potential on top of it all. After my most recent ex found out that I would be averaging $500k in a few years, he started picking fights and always making me out to be the villain, and I know Im not imagining it. It ultimately ended with the explanation of you dont need me, youll find someone better and leave. Maybe he was letting me down easy but I myself know that I am attractive. My work ethic translates to my physical upkeep, and I have improved my looks since we began dating, if anything.


I know that a lot of it has to do with him not feeling like a hero, but I really did try to make sure he felt needed. Its just that I dont really need any saving. I want a partner, and it seems like that is too much to ask. Has anyone else been in this situation?",0

5643,5644,"<https://www.change.org/p/devendra-fadnavis-mentoo-needs-your-support-to-stop-
misuse-of-laws?signed=true>  
  
women misusing laws against men in india for extortion, manipulation and
revenge/vendetta has become an epidemic that not only threatens the moral
fabric of our society but puts lacs of innocent men behind bars.  
  
lacs of innocent men are languishing behind bars in overcrowded jails, and
there are no laws to protect them or legal body to hear their anguish and
support them.  
  
our constitution states that we are all equal irrespective of caste, colour or
gender. however, we have laws that only protect women and no parallel laws to
protect men. in fact, pro-women laws are being misused to victimise men and
men have no real recourse under law.  
  
we need to put deterrents in place to prevent misuse of laws, victimisation of
men, and also to ensure gender neutral laws are put in place.  
  
[#mentoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mentoo) with pooja
bedi intends to push lawmakers to draft legislation in parliament to create
checks and balances in society that give men and their families equal
protection under law and punishment to those who misuse laws.  
  
please note; [#mentoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mentoo)
is not anti [#metoo](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo).
women who misuse laws and file false cases are a deterrent to women
empowerment movements.  
  
what needs to change?????  
  
1\. name of accused to be kept as confidential as victims name until proven
guilty.  
  
a woman who files a rape complaint gets her identity protected but the men
carry the hashtag of
[#rapist](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rapist) from moment
case is registered. not just them, the women in their families be it mother,
sister, wife, daughter all bear the brunt of his rapist hashtag. shockingly if
case is proven false, no real punishment is meted out the woman who has
destroyed the life, career, reputation of the man and put him and his family
through mental, emotional and physical torture. punishment for the woman can
be a mere 500 rupees.statistics are shocking.  
  
data by the delhi commission for women states 53.2% of rape cases filed in
delhi between april 2013 and july 2014 turned out to be false.  
  
2\. rape/ domestic violence cases filed post 3 months of date of alleged
rape/abuse to be treated differently and arrest only after investigation of
the same.  
  
most fake cases are filed after deliberation, plotting and connivance with
friends, family and lawyers.  
  
statistics claim almost 75 % of dv cases are false and according to ncrb data,
10% dowry cases filed each year are proven false. there are over 11 lac men
languishing in jails implicated in false cases.  
  
in 2013, out of the investigated 1,12,058 cases, 10,864 were false. and in
2012, 10,235 out of 1,03,848 were proven false. after this data was released,
the supreme court had observed that the law meant to combat the menace of
harassment of women by their husband or in-laws was often being used as a
‚Äúweapon rather than shield by disgruntled wives‚Äù. the ipc 498a being a
cognisable and non-bailable offence only worsens the plight of those falsely
accused. sections 354, 509 and 376 are there to protect women, and not to
terrorise innocent men.  
  
3\. severe penalty to put in place for women who have been proven to have
filed a fake case as deterrent to others.  
  
please note: there is a distinction between an acqquital on grounds of
insufficient evidence and when it is a proven false case.  
  
4\. creation of national commission for men.  
  
if women have a body that addresses their issues we need one in place for men
as well. data states that for for every 16 women who commit suicide 25 men
commit suicide.  
  
5\. introduce purushdhan which will give a man the same economic rights and
footing as streedhan.  
  
many cases are coming to light of women marrying men and within a few months
demanding divorce and large sums of money. they threaten a man and his family
under sections of 376, 354, 509 and 498a if they don't comply. the assets a
man is given by his famliy or what he has earned prior to marriage should be
considered his. only what is earned during their marriage should be part of a
divorce proceeding based on number of years spent together and whether kids
are involved.  
  
6\. right to prenuptial agreements  
  
currently pre nups are not legal as it absurdly gets challenged under bonded
labour laws. men are increasingly shying away from marriage as it means
extortion. clarity on money will bring rights and respect to both.  
  
7\. to clearly define rape  
  
there have been judgements stating that if a man is in a live in relationship
it can fall under rape. promise to marry and not marrying is equivalent to
rape. rape is a heinous crime and laws for it are stringent. we need to
clearly define rape.  
  
8\. palimony to be taken as seriously as alimony.  
  
if a man is not earning and a woman is, he should be entitled to palimony with
the same respect and laws that grant a woman alimony.  
  
9\. gender neutral laws to be implemented  
  
when men face domestic violence there is no law to support them even if they
submit videographic evidence. same with rape. men on men rape and women on men
rape needs to recognised especically when rape is defined as intercourse under
threat/coercion. also for sexual harassment laws in the workplace to be gender
neutral.  
  
men in india have been imprisoned not only by gender stereotyping but also a
lack of laws and no official body to hear their cries. men are human. and if
we want an equal society, equal relationships, equal justice, we need equal
laws.  
  
please support our petition and lets push for equality and justice  
  
thank you so so so much",0
6395,6396,"Own Your Shit Weekly - May 12, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. 

We have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. 

Think of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.

Finally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.

3554,3555,"How do I become more receptive to feminism? I hope this question makes sense, but just a short explanation of what I mean.

I'm a guy in my early twenties, I'm going to university, and I've been trying to change recently, so I also started reading up on feminism. Now, I've always been generally left-wing, but when I read a feminist critique for example, I sometimes become quite dismissive. What I mean but that is that I think things like:

""That's ridiculous/not true""

""Oh, so that's a problem too?""

""Seems like everything is an issue""

But when I think about the points, I was so eager to dismiss, some more, I'm more open to them and usually understand where they're coming from. However, that first impulse is really weird. It's sort of like I'm realising that I've been benefitting from some of the problems women face in society, simply because of how society is set up, and my brain doesn't want to admit that because it's easier for me to ignore everything and act like I've done nothing wrong and that everything is fine and dandy?

STBX is having car issues. Keeps dying in random places because she hasn't gotten proper maintenance done on it.

I need to reflect on why her negligence with her car maintenance makes me angry... it doesn't put the kids in danger really, just inconvenience and embarrass them and me (at least according to my feelings, and I don't want to make decisions based on that)

After reflection I've come to the conclusion that (as usual for me) it stems from my lack of control of the situation. I can't force or coerse STBX to live her life better, and yet she still has an impact on my children in very real and tangible ways. She is their female role model, and I don't like what she models a lot of the time. 

That said, I need to focus on my own shit before calling the kettle black. 

I made the appointment for the car and drove her to the bank to get her money. (Her car was fully nonfunctional at this point) Hopefully this puts an end to it IRL, but either way it was another opportunity for me to see inside myself and fix a fucked up thought/feeling.

###Family

STFU continues to be a critical part of my life, for a Different reason than most guys here. As previously covered, I rent the second floor of my parent's large home. Large enough that the space over the garage is now STBX's ""apartment"" with me just using the kitchen and laundry, and the space over the rest of the house is ""my apartment"" where I spend the majority of my time when I'm actually home. 

My parents obviously know that I'm out late several nights a week and for a chunk here and there on weekends, and while my step dad hasn't said anything, my mother has been probing and pressuring consistently. I've taken this as an important part of my growth program, because a large part of my BP conditioning and Nice Guy tendencies came from being raised by her in my early years as a single mother. Mostly I just STFU and ignore her, and I Fog outside of that. She's even gone overt once ""you're not working or running errands or working out this much, so why don't you take 3yo to play with your *friend's* kids? I'm sure they also have some???"" She's trying to Frame it as me missing time with my 3yo, but I'm doing this my way, and the stage of me being out until 9 almost every night will have been short lived. Like I said a few weeks ago, I always knew that my level of activity to create the plates I have now was not sustainable. Her feelings on this are not important. No one needs to know my inner thoughts, my plans, my weakness or my strength. No one. I am the judge of my own actions and I decide what I will do with my time. 

Had a ""critical moment"" with 3yo this week, from my perspective anyway. Critical more in my evaluation of my own efforts as a parent. Bedtime has been a sore point for me for a long time, and I haven't been consistent here like I have in many other areas of parenting for 3yo.

She had riled herself up to throwing a tantrum with mom, refusing to eat her dinner, despite STBX and my own attempts to de-escalate and distract her and get her to listen to us both. She was warned by both me and STBX many times that if she didn't stop, it would be early bed time with daddy. She kept going intentionally, gauging us both. So I took her to bed in my part of the house, spent about 15 minutes patiently but firmly leading her to calm down and stop the crying and screaming and such, then explaining what a consequence is and why she needs to listen to mom and dad, and staying firm through her varied techniques and attempts at getting me to cave and let her go back and finish eating her dinner in the noisy lit up part of the house. She finally fell asleep, and so did I, but even just a week or two ago I would have gotten frustrated that she always wants to be with mom where the screens are always on, and I would have taken her back to STBX and told her to deal with it. This time, while I am still unhappy with how STBX runs her end of bedtimes and continue to express this in the form of suggestions when 3yo is misbehaving, I didn't take my 3yo expressing this preference repeatedly as a personal offense and was amused by it instead - I had empathy for my 3yo and realized if I were in her shoes, I'd prefer mom too (little/no restrictions, stay up late every night, get away with a lot, tablet all the time to keep me out of mom's hair, etc) - but also I understand that as her father it is important for me to be consistent and follow through on things I tell her I am going to do, and teach her to live a life of integrity. I also want to model the type of man she should look for in her adult life, and a HVM doesn't let the mood swings of a toddler get the best of him

**Take responsibility for your little prison of flesh and everything else will fall into place.** 

Today was the first day of this pandemic that I felt like it wasn't going to be easy.

In the rare occasions I feel down I tend to think ""Welp that's it, I feel like shit and I have no control over the situation so I guess I'll just feel shit until I don't.""

I know, fkn helpful huh.

Thankfully I've been working on this and a lot more. So after a long day of things just not going my way and my overall state of mind not helping I recognised it was time for a good ol' meditation. I have found that taking a breather can go a long way.

So there I am all zen and shit when I allow my mind to wander a little so I can figure my shit out.

I asked myself what might be one of the oldest questions: Why am I not happy right now?

Well idk I've been taking care of myself. A couple weeks ago I started taking workouts far more seriously (thanks TRP) and doing some yoga too. But hmm now that I think about it such a change in lifestyle can temporarily make you feel drained of energy. I have also been eating well than before BUT HMM now that I think about it I skipped a few meals in the last couple days. And I did (make a conscious decision to) relapse from NoFap today. And yadayadayada

Huh, it makes a whole lotta sense my brain isn't giving me happy chemicals, even tho just a few days ago I was thriving in almost the same routine. I've been on autopilot, haven't I?

So I considered all my past experiences on this contentment subject and looked for the exact things I haven't been doing.

Surprise surprise, it was nothing I didn't already know subconsciously. And yet I had it so perfectly laid out in front of me that I wrote it down and stuck it in the window in front of my desk. Call it a dogma for contentment:

&#x200B;

""But a disciplined life without dopamine seems so boring!""

You'll be surprised to find how fulfilling it becomes. Not only it's far easier to find contentment, but you also know what you want in order to be happy. 

More specifically, you are more aware of what your body and brain need in order to stay tf out of your way.

Let me break down my experience:

1. **Let go of vices** \- I was doing NoFap and getting laid consistently so I had to make a smooth transition. Space out masturbation and don't fall into porn. Weed (which is everywhere in my social circles) also tends to make me lazy and can get me down. Social media, youtube videos with no valuable content yadayada. 
2.  **Good habits and looking after yourself** \- Exercise, yoga, meditation, staying in touch with people, watching a few sunsets and adding variety to the day through a hobby.
3. **Appreciate Life** \- The day goes by faster, you enjoy the simple things, you feel fulfilled and in the right course.
4.  **Know what you need** \- By going off autopilot and cultivating mindfulness you don't fall back into old habits and you notice what you need as soon as that need arises.

Thank you for reading. Honestly, I wrote this more for myself. My state of mind can be quite volatile, which probably isn't the case for most fellas. But I hope it helps someone. Also if there's any grammar mistakes or incongruencies: English ain't my first language.

China is a postcolonial revanchist ethnostate, and its entire state ideology is really a kind of fascism driven by the same sense of humiliation which fueled German Nazism. 

Their entire state ideology is about reclaiming China's ""rightful position"" in the world as the ""middle kingdom"" (by which they mean the center of the world), which they see as having been ""stolen"" from them during the Century Of Humiliation (the colonial period). They were one of the first *incubators* of the ideology of post-colonial grievance. 

CCP ideology is basically Nazi, but replace ""Aryan"" with ""Han Chinese."" They demand Tibet and East Turkistan as *Lebensraum* for instance. 

Chinese Socialism has always been, from the very start, a nationalist project (even to this day, the CCP regards Sun Yat-Sen as its forefather despite Sun Yat-Sen being the founder of the rival Kuomindang). 

Of course the CCP lob the ""racist"" accusation at the West. Their entire state ideology is built on an experience of unfair treatment at the hands of Western colonial powers (and with some exceptions, such as Hong Kong, the simple reality is that the Western colonial powers DID treat China appallingly). 

The reality, however, is that the West eventually realized that racism, colonialism and the like were bad things. The Chinese government, on the other hand, has no such moral scruples. Imperial China, and even present-day China, engage/d in absurd levels of racism and colonialism (they subjugated their Asian neighbours frequently, with no remorse whatsoever). 

I mean the blunt reality is that slavery, oppression, imperialism, colonialism and such was the *reality of human history up until the last few centuries*. Almost every civilization engaged in these things to some degree, and almost every civilization was the victim of these things to some degree. The West *absolutely* engaged in them... just like everyone else.

The West's record is distinguished only by two things: first, the formalization of the scientific method and the resultant industrial revolution made the West more capable at engaging in these things. Secondly, the ideas of the enlightenment ultimately made Westerners come to the conclusion that slavery, racism, imperialism and colonialism were all bad things. The West didn't invent slavery, but the West was the first civilization to abolish it. 

Yet the West is asked, unlike every other civilization, to contemplate and repent for its own sins. Despite the fact that we were the first people to realize they were sins, and the first people to develop a philosophy which consistently opposed all of these things. 

When the Chinese government calls you a racist, tell them to look in the mirror. There's a reason the Christchurch Gunman said the PRC was the state most aligned with his values... the PRC is a fascist, ethnonationalist, racist, colonialist shithole, and Beijing is guilty of every sin it accuses the West of committing.",0

called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir

Men and women, in the grand scheme, are far more alike than we are different, and the more time you spend talking to women on a human to human level rather than a man to woman, the more you will see that. Generally speaking, female motivation and male motivation come from the same human desires. The desire for companionship, the desire for validation, the desire for safety. The differences in how we seek these things is largely socialized and even so varies wildly among those in the same societies.

The way I've understood it thus far, it is ""fair use"" to use a piece of copyrighted material if you are providing critique, commentary, education, satire, etc *on that material.* Providing commentary on copyright law in general is not commentary on that piece of music.

Of course, there is no market usurpation, and I'm sure a minimal clip was used, though that might not be enough of a defense. The nature of the work is clearly a for-profit music arrangement in an artful and novel expression.

In effect, nobody is claiming this *isn't* copyright infringement, but is it really *fair use?*

While it's been a bit busy the past couple days, I've been able to keep tabs on how, since the weekend (at minimum), Sophia Narwitz tried to ask one simple question from the game journo cliques. Indeed, it's just one single name. [ONE NAME](https://twitter.com/SophNar0747/status/1231439926115389445).

...And all she got in return was either ridicule or slander, with no one even giving an actual answer.

EDIT: A quick browse through her feed on Twitter [not only confirms](https://twitter.com/SophNar0747/status/1232301920108392448) that her comments in the OP aren't hyperbole. But that said journos and their ""allies"" in sites like ResetEra are still doubling down.",0

You find young people at the cheaper hostels where they can still tolerate 10+ people dorms and sharing only one shower.

You have two options, simply switch hostels if you don't like your experience or just deal with it until you move on. You'll definitely have great travel interactions at some point but it's normal that they're not occuring 100% of the time. That's why they're special moments.",0

Im only a nurse, but we still make good income, and for a few months I was making more than my partner. Now, were making about the same. But, my partner recognized the feminine skills that are involved with a caregiving field, and while I know I have a strong intellect, I admire and look up to him so much. For his ideas, leadership, perspective, Im almost always asking his advice or opinion instead of feeling the need to give him advice. I think these things lessened his insecurity regarding the pay difference, and I always make sure he feels like the man of the house. Id definitely up-play the feminine traits that make you good at your job, and find partners you deeply admire and respect. You cant fake that. 

Honestly, men intimidated enough by income to leave are probably not secure enough in the value they bring to the table as men. I do need my man, not for financial reasons but for 1000 other reasons. Find someone who sees that.
