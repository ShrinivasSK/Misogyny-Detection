6423,6424,"The old school mafia/yakuza sort of organizations were killed off, because they were collectively a threat to the rising power of the organized crime syndicate that infiltrated and took over politics. 

Singularly, a mafia family or yakuza gang was only really effective in their own burrow. They might have been a thorn in the side of a mayor or police chief. But even then, they largely kept things in-house and had somewhat of a code of ""no innocents"" or at least, no touching those within their own communities. 

Then, as more of these organizations formed, they started getting more powerful. Forming alliances, making enemies of each other. 

Then drugs became a huge part of it, and a lot of the rules went out the window. 

Sometime during the 60s and 70s, when the drugs were rampant within those underworld gangs, they basically were at odds with gov entities, kind of like what we see now in places like mexico where they have cartel problems. Their power wasn't really equal, but it was enough to be a threat. 

Where those people held as much sway or perhaps coercion over their communities as any gov entity did. 

It was pretty well documented that they could even sway elections, and that goes back even into the early days. 

If a bunch of mafia dudes showed up to collect their protection money, and ""reminded"" you that your business, and all of your employees needed to vote for a certain candidate.... That probably meant that if that candidate lost, there would be repercussions. So those businesses needed to coerce their employees, their unions, etc., through whatever means, to vote a certain way. 

Well.... once they become at odds with the politicians as a whole, they have lose their usefulness in that regard, which is why they basically went extinct. 

I mean, sure... There are still shady organized crime rings, but it's mostly cartel linked stuff now. Nothing like the mafia/yakuza stuff from back in the day. All of that stuff more or less dissipated. 

They all either went to prison, died off, or went into politics. 

The same families, the same money, the same old power structures still exist somewhat... They just don't have the same ways of doing business. Now they just operate through political business dealings, big donors, and fundraisers. 

The ""protection money"" rackets are less about sending thugs to a sandwich shop with baseball bats to collect money, assuring them that nobody will bust their windows out... But more about sending a limo with political campaign lawyers to a boardroom to assure corporate interests that votes against a certain regulation are going to go a certain way so long as the campaign gets into office... At which point donations are made to the campaign. 

Really.... You can think about the organized crime world like an organism with life cycles. The 20th century romanticized version of mobsters running around all Tony Soprano was basically the coming of age, angsty teenager stage. 

It matured in the 90s and 2000s and morphed into the adult stage that we have now.",0

6152,6153,"@jin #4289369 no one is born gay. if you'll look into it deeply you'll know
its a satanic agenda promoted by elite satanists in hollywood,the music
industry etc.. i've heard it from actors and singers themselves. being a
supporter of gay rights opens the gates to accepting of worse sins like
acceptance of satanism. us gay laws were passed in 2015, one year or 2 years
later, satanism is made an official religion in us and they've built a statue
of the baphomet right in front of the 10 commandments. also it's really funny
how we are called bigots when in reality, you people support public nudity in
gay parades, and how you can support legal pedophilia (kid drag queen, desmond
is amazing, danced in a bar with dollar bills thrown on him by nude and semi
nude gay men) also we are called bigots when preachers are assaulted by gay
people on a regular basis. seriously, gay pride parades are nothing more than
public pornography. for those telling me to stop hating, first answer the
above questions. also its illegal to mispronounce your gender,or to get into a
debate with gay people,yet its perfectly legal to mock our lord jesus. several
gay celebs and gay people have mocked jesus on national tv,yet that's not
called hate. also christians don't hate gay people, but rather the sin of
homosexuality. no one is born gay,its a demonic perversion. i've talked online
and debated with members of the lgbtq community,none of them are able to
answer my question. also i've had several encounters where those people show
sick pornographic lgbt images(some loving community huh) just for engaging in
a debate. i've heard testimonies of people who used to be part of the lgbt
community, actually calling it a horrible sin. the theme of lgbt is pride, but
mainstream media which is controlled by satanic elites in hollywood and the
music industry have made us forget about god. ever wondered why so many
homosexual pedophilia takes place in hollywood? its because high ranked
directors and celebs have sold their souls, and pedophilia,rape, molestation
are ways of indoctrination into the higher levels of this society. lgbt is an
agenda supported by satanists,whom you think are atheists. its a prophecy in
biblical texts. even pope leo xiii had visions of what's to come for this
world. he saw satan telling god that he's going to control and influence the
world in the 20th century,in those visions,satan showed leo xiii visions of
war, abortion, demonic possessions, and yes homosexuality! and this vision
happened over 130 years ago,and its true. the 20th century had more deaths in
wars than all the other centuries combined,sibs became virtues, pornography
becomes so popular almost all people have seen it one way or another,
abortions have taken place in such a way that the number of dead fetuses could
fill an ocean, homosexuality becomes supported even more than christianity.
the world we live in is made to believe that god and satan doesn't exist, but
its a high level agenda done by the freemasons, kaballists,shriners, and
illumunati. they control mainstream media,they are in nasa, cia, fbi and any
government places. if you've read till here, i humbly ask you to first answer
my questions before ignorantly calling me an idiot or bigot or anything of
that sort. else, i'll consider you as a foolish ignorant nutbag who is simply

3738,3739,"They say they love a relationship with an independent strong woman (aka I have my own life and my own career I focus on a lot), but everyone who I have dated, who loved that about me at the start, always went one of two ways:

1. They actually don't want an independent strong woman but rather a woman who they can control. They don't like that they aren't always the only thing I care about in this world.
2. They never would go on to the next step or never would grow up - they always wanted to stay in sort of ""completely committed bachelor mode"" as I sort of like to call it. Wanna buy a house? Nah. Wanna move in? Maybe. Do you love me? I want to marry you. Would you ever actually propose we have been together for 4 years? Idk.

So I have come to believe that men really just want women that either completely submit or women who aren't all about 'furthering' themselves in life - rather just have a woman who works, comes home, and hangs out and nothing else (depending on what kinda guy they are - crazy or chill). I always seeing them saying they want the independent strong woman, but I truly believe 99% of men don't actually want this - they want the illusion, the fantasy they sell themselves of this woman.",0

that bitch and their family members who filed false case against him.Now this
is the only way left for justice in india.Now indian bitches will marry to
innocent man to make shortcut money and have their husband as slave.If man
denies to be a slave of her then he and his famly will be threaten by false
dowry case and ask millions of money in revenge. PROSTITUTES ARE MUCH MUCH
BETTER THEN THESE MARRIED BITCHES, at least these prostitutes makes money in a
honest way and do not cheat their customers and do not spoil their family at
all but these bitches asks millions in the favors of getting fucked for few
nights and their parents who are retired and brother who is in drugs and do
not make any money then for these basterds teach this bitch girl to marry a
innocent guy and get fucked for few nights and then fuck their in laws family
by putting false dowry case so brides family can feed their self with the
money got as compromise called ""REVERSE DOWRY "".After getting money as
settlement these bitches and their family starts hunting for another man
.Indian judicial system knows everything but do not want to do anything and
makes money out of it..sure every one will get lesson because every one has
son and daughter and their daughter in law files the same dawry case against
their son then they will realize and learn the lesson.The people are too
scared to marry a girl once get married and if threaten by girl to file false
case then it will happen that people will kill her and her family before going
to jail after all once they charged in false dowry case then there is no
chance left for compromise except kill them all as only left option as JUSTICE
.so now its upto indian court what they want? do they want to keep these
bitches filling false case one by one and get killed by their husband ???or
court will have the option to do proper investigartion before arrest and if
the bride is convicted then file the case against her and her family and give
them life imprisonment because death penelty is too less for them..God save

6402,6403,"**Breaking Free Activity 18**: Identify a gift you initially resisted, any gifts you need to surrender to right now. 

Initially: basically all failure/hardship. Ray Dalio said pain + reflection = growth. Friends in high school, trial, etc. Many things I can think of. 

Now: Ex shitiness, this is an opportunity for me to practice and grow so I can become the man I want to be and have what I want in my life.  

**Breaking Free Activity 19:** One area where you routinely feel frustrated or out of control. Are you trying to project the reality you want onto the situation? If you had to accept the reality of this situation, how might you change your response to it?

Relationships/women  I want the bluepill fantasy, I want to life happily ever after, I want there to be something more than survival of the fittest. If I had to accept this, which Im currently trying to do, I would treat online dating as marketing, I would accept I wont be loved like that but that I dont need to be and accept there is no relationships destination where I can relax and just be me. 

Separation  Im still having a hard time accepting this, it ties into the above, Im holding onto the blue pill fantasy and ignoring reality. The reality is, she did thinks regularly that crossed my boundaries, I let her from the start and doesnt offer that much in a relationship. If I accepted all this then I would let go and move on, acknowledge my tendency to only remember the good and remind myself of the bad, accept that I might have been able to make it work had I been less of a faggot but its too late now. 

Life  I want there to be a meaning to life but I know there is only the meaning you make. It feels pointless that we just life to reproduce and die, I want there to be something more. If I accepted this I would do more of what I want, for me, not some false obligation to society or anybody else. I would care less what they thought of me, angry selfish, whatever the accusations, I would just life for me and what I want. 

Daughter  I have fear that Ill lose her somehow, death, ex stopping my access etc. And I might. If I accepted this I would have less anxiety. 

**Breaking Free Activity 20**  guidelines for feelings. 

Read, try to keep in mind. 

Some comments, feelings are separate to the issue, I make them one and the same, you can have a feeling with no obligation to do anything and without it meaning anything. I am scared to have feelings, I am scared of having bad feelings that I cant handle and just any feelings but by stopping them I actually feel much worse. I am not even able to feel safe in my own feelings, how is a woman supposed to be safe in me?  

**Breaking Free Activity 21**  list one fear that has been controlling your life. Use affirmations I can handle it, no matter what happens, I will handle it until you take actions and stop feeling fear. 

* Moving on form the separation. 
* My daughter dying. 
* Starting a business.

**Breaking Free Activity 22**  Identify one area that is out of integrity. Identify the fear. 

Truly moving on from ex, I would fantasize about her sexually and indulge fantasys of us getting back together. I would use this to avoid feeling negative feelings about the relationship and family breaking down. I am scared I am making a mistake, that my daughter will suffer as a results, that Ill regret my decision, that I will be alone and not able to have what I want. I think this is being driven by; I dont back myself and I fear exs actions. I still dont have the confidence that I can make my life whatever I want (although I get glimpses of it). 

Fear 2: I fear starting/taking on something big. I am scared it will overwhelm me and Ill quit. That I will fail and be laughed at. As a kid, my family went bankrupt due to a business venture and I think I associate that to trying something myself. Considering my current situation, I think the best plan is to spend a few more months getting my shit sorted and starting something on the side. From there I can reassess.",0

He leads me in the Faith- he had a proven track record *before* I met him.

Before I met him; My husband he was active in ministry in his previous church. Once that church had dispensed he has committed to attending another church weekly. He has always given faithfully to the church and has supported various missions. He is also sponsoring a child.

After I met him; His commitments did not change. Since before we were engaged he brought me along to his church and introduced me to his church family. He has supported me in supporting the missions I am involved in financially and also agreed with my request for us to contribute more to the church. He has continued sponsoring a child (which he did not advertise to me, but I noticed when I saw a letter from world vision).

Now we are married; We attend church weekly together. Every night in bed he reads his bible next to me before we sleep. He also has a YouTube channel where he creates sermon jams. 

He has never over promised or broken a promise.

The first time I met my husband he kissed me on the cheek and opened the car door for me, the door swung back and closed, but by that time he was half way around the car. He cringed hard and tried to brush it off. 

From that first meeting forward he always opened my car door when coming to pick me up and closed it behind me. I would always giggle and insist he never had to do that and it was ridiculous to keep up, but on this occasion and on many he said Ill never do anything for you that I cant keep up. And it was true. 

He never over promised, he never over extended, he never spoilt me to woo me in the beginning then became tight later on. His spending, his actions towards me and his love for me never spiked then fell. He opened up the car door for me until we got married and started living together, so I open up my car door now (partly on my insistence, haha). After becoming ill and battling chronic illness, he started opening the door for me again when I was too weak. This is a small example of how he has stayed consistent.

He doesnt lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences.

I always used to joke with my husband why dont you just lie to me?! I dont want to know!  When he told me things I did not want to hear. I was joking, partly, as my sinfulness wanted an easy life and a man that told me what I wanted.

Well, through Gods grace to me, Im married to a man that is so honest to me, sometimes it is confrontational. He doesnt like above the knee jean shorts, he thinks theyre hideous. He doesnt like t-shirt dresses, he thinks theyre equally hideous (two things I wore often), he doesnt like long skirts on me, he doesnt like short hair etc...etc... it might sound picky, but its directional and in going against what hes said, that would be the true confrontation. It is unloving to do something you know your partner does not like.

My husband spoke to me and suggested we go shopping. He encouraged me to dress like some of the girls my age and that how they dress would suit me a lot (can you imagine hearing this without a humble heart?) but he has never brought something up without his support and means to fix the issue. So, he takes me shopping. Wow, look at my hot fianc! (We were engaged at the time) it made me feel admired and loved, it was amazing to see his reaction and how happy he was every time I skipped out to his car wearing the clothes he bought me. In saying that, we didnt buy anything I wasnt comfortable in, a few pairs of jeans, white sneakers, multiple t shirts of the same colour- so simple but he loved it, and I loved him even more for telling me. Ive bought many husband approved dresses since, which he adores.


He has clear standards for me. He introduced me to his friends, family and church. 

In his vetting process of me, he let me have his real personality from the beginning. He made things clear how he liked it and as we interacted with other couples, we saw real life examples of how we would and wouldnt want to be like. 

Couple A- My husband is friends with the husband. He cant stand the wife. Shes overweight, unkind and screams at her husband in public. My hubby was very clear at his distain for her and never pretended to like her even in front of her. He was blunt and didnt go out of his way to acknowledge her. It was clear he did not respect her. I never wanted that to be me.

Couple B- My husband did ministry for a long time with the husband of this couple. His wife was sweet, feminine and absolutely lovely. She was kind and warm to me when I was an outsider in the group. She was respectful of her husband and it showed in everything they did together. She was thin and dressed well. My husband enjoyed our time a lot with this couple and told me how much he respected their relationship. He would say things like theyre the real deal I think its amazing shes kept in shape so well after having a child 

By this feedback, and seeing how he treated these different types of people, and on top of that, knowing how consistent he is as a person, I knew how not to act. 

His health/ my health 

He has made it clear that cooking at home needs to be healthy. My husband goes to the gym 5-6 days a week and eats the same thing for lunch everyday. I would push him sometimes for him to let me prepare him lunch, but he insistent that is what he will eat everyday and it is what is best for his health. 

We go shopping together and buy the food I will cook together. I buy ingredients he likes and ingredients that are healthy. He has told me he wants veggies in his diet, so thats what I cook. He wants high protein meals, so thats what I cook. I make sure I have the ingredients for all the meals he could want (to a point) so he has the freedom to ask for what he wants for dinner.  

He has made what he wants clear. He does not allow us to eat take away more than once a week. He is hyper aware of his body (I always catch him tensing in front of the mirror, haha) and is hyper aware of my body. Hes made it clear he does not want me to gain any weight and that the weight I am right now is the largest he would like me (Im 58kg, 54) he has also found the most hilarious way to let me know Im gaining weight  wow honey, look how big your breasts are! Makes me laugh thinking about it. With his help, Ive stayed pretty much the same weight since meeting him. Him being honest about his absolute disgust for fat people has helped- and its a mutual thing. I wouldnt ever let him gain weight and I have his support back.


He takes care of me and brings me security 

Financial security; My husband sought to get a stable job and savings before he put himself on the market to be married. By the time I met him, he had a deposit saved for a house and a job that was recession proof. He made it clear to me that is getting a house together would require me working full time until we were ready for kids. He told me it would be difficult and that he would support me in this. 

God provided me a job that is close to home and my husband drives me every morning. (Currently not working due to COVID)

Health; during our engagement I had a trip to the ER. It turned out I had a cyst on my ovary, we did not realise the health hurdles we would be tackling in the next year and a half because of it. 5 more trips to the ER, specialist and doctors appointments, IUD insertions and a surgery later, Im still on the mend and take pain killers to manage in the meantime. This is a chronic condition called endometriosis. I never, ever expected my husband to be so supportive and unconditionally loyal. 

I remember on one trip to the hospital I was passing out in the passengers seat and vomiting. In my moments of consciousness I looked to my husband and he kept saying dont worry baby, we are almost there, its going to be ok.

I trusted him and let the anxiety go. Its a blurr but I ended up in a hospital bed getting emergency pain relief. He waited with me in the hospital the entire day. This happened quiet a few more times. After my operation I went back to the ER and we waited in the horrible waiting room chairs for 8 hours through the early hours of the morning. Everytime I looked at him I wanted to cry out of gratitude, I felt so horrid and he was right there with me. I can not believe the level of empathy and maturity he has shown to me when I was in 10/10 pain.

In my moments of absolute weakness and exhaustion, so much so I couldnt cry out to God, he would put his hand on me and pray for me.

He puts me first before his family.

We come from a traditional culture where the mothers tend to baby their sons. I love my MIL to death and I dont mind her asking questions, but my husband without hesitation always shuts everyone down if they question how I am at home. 

Does Anna cook for you everyday? He will respond along the lines of why does it matter? She can do as she likes shes the cook of the home. 

Oh, poor Anna, she cant speak our language he will respond what do you mean poor Anna? Shes a lion. You should be the one learning English.

He will shut down any conversation that is not kind to me, he does not complain about me to his family nor friends. He will not let his friends joke about our sex life.

He does not let me overextend myself for the sake of his family even though I am extremely willing to. He tells me and has the strong belief that our immediate family unit (him and me) are most important and everything else is secondary. We of course love his family a lot, especially his parents, but hes made it clear we wont partake in anything just for the sake of tradition. 

Bonus points:

-He gets along amazingly with my Dad, we all hang out all the time and its the best part of my life! 

-His family love me (they joke constantly they love me more than they love him!)
 
-He is good with children and loves his nephews, we even baby set sometimes.

-He grew his beard for me.",0
5427,5428,"The successful post-thaw survival rate for eggs is quite high (85% for over 36s and 95% got unfrt 36s). The lower success rates that exist in general are for IVF. The complications that arise with successfully regaining fertility off of frozen eggs are not to do with the freezing procedure itself.

>If women are committing suicide 4x the rate of men (I don't buy that, although I have seen some data to suggest that attempt it more often), have more depression and anxiety and all sorts of mental health issues, cant report abuse etc due to all sorts of mental and trauma blocks and stay with abusive partners.... why the hell are feminists saying toxic masculinity is the problem cause for male mental health issues or imply that men should be more like women, or women are wonderful and talk to each other and all that.... clearly the crisis is in women as you say yourself, as none of that female stuff they apparently do, and open up and talk, is helping them clearly is it? Women are killing themselve 4x as much according to you, and also being too indecisive to actually do it. You cant Balme toxic masculinity now all of a sudden, if it is female mental health care that is in crisis according to you!

You see im not letting feminism have it both ways. And BTW the incidence of female suicide attempts is so high is one because of borderline personality disorder in women (they are not actually trying to kill themselves, although sometimes they accidentally do) and also basic stats that feminists often cant understand.... obviously if women aren't able to actually kill themselves the number of attempts per year (there's men and women, much more so women who attempt like 300x a year) will be high vs a man 1 attempt and he actually kills himself.

if feminist bang on about men being responsible for violence, then sure, but that means on the whole they are responsible for inventing everything, discovering everything, exploring and pushing frontiers for humanity (oceans, space, new countries, continents, arctic, desserts etc), fine art, music, film, history, culture, billionaires, Nobel prize winners, billionaires and leaders... leaders even in female dominated industries and female activities such as fashion, shopping, makeup, cooking (so feminists can complain its because women are a minority, as men are a minority there and face social taboo in those fields but still end up on top)

My main issue is the double standards. Women already have to go through enough with menstrual cycles and pregnancies. Im not saying women have it better or worse than me, just that reproduction is a particularly difficult aspect. Menstruated cycles and pregnancy already hurt women. Birth control hurts women even more. 

So hopefully by talking about male birth control, starting a conversation, debunking myths, reporting statistics and facts, we can facilitate a safe environment where men can learn/talk about birth control, see the pain that women bear, and can normalise taking responsibility in a completely safe and healthy way.create a safe environment where taking some responsibility doesnt mean hurting yourself in the process",0

&#x200B;

Lets take one issues affecting men and specifcally see what feminism (organisations not just random individuals) had to say about it. I have direct statements and policies from the feminisnt organisations. See below.

So Norway has  forced male only conscription:

1. the ultimate form of slaverly, where men, regardless of their moral background or personality are forced to learn how to kill or face prison.
2. This is one of the biggest manifestations of gynocynetsicm in society and of course proof that the hypothesis of patriarchy is as robust as modern flat earth theory. Yes men create systems to benefit men by getting men to do all the dangerous and hard things (93% of work deaths, and here the milatry)
3. Many countries need conscription as voluntary private armies are too expensive for the nation. So it is needed. Of course the feminists know this and only want men to do it. Feminists when questioned often pay lip service, and say ""yeah we support no draft, but if there is a draft women should do it too"", as they know it wont happen.. erm until it does. Norway passes both gender conscrtiption. Lets see what feminists flip flopped when shit it did happen:

Firstly one party voted against it in parliment. Many of Noways feminists organisations (NKF, IAW, WILPF) were viciously against it

Had a friend of mine who dated this one girl. She once, without asking, unzipped his pants and blew him. He asked her to stop; she kept going. He breaks up with her sometime later and she gets upset and falsely accuses him of rape. (This was while we were in our senior year of high school). Everyone took the girls side and people were making death threats on a regular basis. One of his exswho was notorious for being feminist to the point that the word was almost synonymous with her namealso came forward with a false rape accusation. Even more people got pissed off and took up the MeToo ideology. Police had to escort my friend wherever he went bc he actually got jumped a few times 

Fortunately, no legal action was taken against him. Eventually it all blew over but several still thought my friend was in the wrong after it since they never listened to the truth. Now, my friend asks for permission to do simple things such as hug, shake hands, high five, help someone up, etcall because hes worried someone will toss him a false accusation if he doesnt hear clear consent for simple interactions.....its really messed up",0

6098,6099,"Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**

Weve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. 

**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**

I could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.

The next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.

Heres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9

*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*

This doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.

Im going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.

A while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...

**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**

The look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. 

Notice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for ""the right thing to say"" or ""the best line."" 

I took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. 

So the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**


Takeaways


- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. 

- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT

- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.

- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. 

- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",1

You just want to maintain your frame as a calm, confident guy and escalate physically from being platonic.  More importantly, the time to act on things is when they feel right.  The time for a funny comment about her kissing you, is in response to when she brings it up.  The easiest time to escalate physically is if you're already dancing with her and physically close, etc.

From the little I know about your situation, it's tough to say where you stand.  But bottom line is that women like a witty, confident guy who doesnt seek their approval and presents as a challenge.  Live your best life, study/work, lift weights, meditate, avoid porn, etc.  Internalize the traits while improving your life with the above work ethic and you will be attractive to most women.

With THIS girl specifically, if she's attracted you already, then you have to escalate your relationship from platonic to physical.  If she is into you , but doesnt see you as a guy who has the balls to act on his desires... you will be permanently friendzoned.  Hopefully that's not where you are.  

Regardless, just live your life, have fun, tease her when you can, and don't try too hard.  Create sexual tension in situations where you can (look it up if you dont know what it means).  Break the touch barrier with non-threatening touch;  elbow, small of back, back of hand, etc.  Keep strong eye contact if you dont already, and a hint of a smile is also a good bet.  But most importantly, ACT when you have an opportunity;  to tease her, to escalate physically, etc.  Use the opportunities when she compliments you, to escalate and banter.  E.g. If she says she was into you the other day or compliments your dancing, you can say something like ""I dont blame you..  I actually had to turn it down a notch, I didn't want you to lose control"".  In other words, tease her when she compliments herself and agree with her in a cocky way when she compliments you.  Use your own words and style, they matter way less than your actions, body language and ultimately your balls to act.  Dont pass up good opportunities to act and escalate physically, sometimes they dont come again...",0

2329,2330,"Totally agreed with your practicality but there are many subtle things that
actually shows how bad the character is and how he suffers for that. You
actually said a lot of things wrong:  
1\. He understands how wrong his attitude is  
2\. Looses his license even though he could have lied and won the case; this
shows how the character matures and starts to remorse his attitude  
3\. He is a kind of person who runs away from a complex situation but at the
end he never wanted to bring that as an excuse (had it not been his friend,
girl would have never known). He did wrong and he realised.  
4\. Totally wrong when you say he is abusing his parents. The ending parts
shows how his relation with father changed.  
5\. Totally wrong when you say he used to stalk that girl even after breakup.
He never does that even though he is unable to move on  
6\. If u see the movie you will understand how he started hating himself. A
man who is narcissistic by nature when he starts to be ashamed of his
personality and attitude, its a very big positive change.  
7\. Okay i agree he ends up getting the girl in a very unrealistic way, but
the scene where he is ready to accept the baby and give him a father without
anything spoken shows the purity in his love (i agree the ripening of the
relationship was very bollywood typical though)  
8\. yes agreed that he was self harming but nowhere did he let the girl know
about it and hence force her to take any decisions based on that. The person
is fake masculine i agree but not manipulative so you cant call it abusive
relationship.  
9\. This guy cares so much about the girl that he rubs her shoulder after
removing her heavy bag.  
10\. The girl had equal domination rights in him as well. She slaps him when
he was out of control angry in a public place and he starts to apologise. I am
sorry I do see a trait of matured and very mentally intimate relationship
here.  
11\. I agree his background was typical bollywood but again as you mentioned
if he was not so pampered he would not have done all the blunders (a humble
background would end up seeing him in jail and maybe a underworld don
biography can be written after that), so to give the film all the colours he
had to belong to a family of means. How about 50 shades of grey as an example
!  
12\. Apparently he never reads(according to you) but how about the fact that
he took her and taught her a lot during a song and never tried to take
advantage of her (she made the first move which shows her agreement). Its also
shown even though he tries to be masculine he never really could face the girl
for long, he was not comfident till the girl agreed.  
13\. You need to agree that girl enjoyed the character and hence he could be
what is portrayed. And hence like kabir (which i do consider a realistic
flawed person), preeti is also a very real character, silent but manipulative.  
14\. Regarding that sex scene. Thats a typical example of rape. Many rapist
actually raped when they were mentally unstabled adding physical needs
(hormones) on top of that. But he says he is sorry and leaves (he dis wrong
but he realises, isnt that good? Isnt that what a normal person should do?)  
15\. He is tharki? Yes he is ... its his sadness mixed with hormones, a very
typical situation of being desparate. But that same person never wanted to go
into a fake relationship, isnt that honesty and maturity? He never wanted to
hurt anyones feelings like his were hurt. All he wants is sex! Isnt that what
hookup culture is in modern Metros? People hookup even without any mental
desparation, just for fun. Why is that not a very real situation then?  
  
Please feel free to couter attack me with a debate. But till then your reviews
are as flawed and biased as the charecter of kabir.  
Ps. I am a big fan of ur work and not a narcissist sympathizer. Dont worry man
todays youth gets enough dose of dumb sexual contents. They are gullable. And
sex sells, thats truth, hence is sold by bollywood. Kabir singh dint sell dumb
sex atlst and is a masterpiece for acting skills. Maybe watch Vijaya
dervakonda in arjun reddy. Takes a lot of effort to get in the shoes of those
villain charecters, should appreciate that before calling it garbage. Ranvir

Would love some help from the RP ladies!As I posted here before, I broke up with my semi-emotionally abusive ex for the final time, and Im determined to make it stick. While he rarely verbally assaulted me (sometimes would call me a bitch), he would constantly criticize me and tell me all the things about myself I needed to change.

I made a list of everything he criticized me more than 3x about. There were 452 list items. One was touches lips to reusable water bottle, and another was wears pink coat that looks childish. He loves playing music and I do not (my mom tried to force me a lot as a kid and it literally makes me panic), and he got into an argument with me for over an hour, trying to make me play piano for/with him. I offered to do ballet (practiced for years as a kid) or write songs to it, but it was no good for him. He threw a tantrum over it once, and locked himself in his room for an hour.

I told him I was sick of him degrading my self-esteem, and to find someone who better fit his needs. If youre wondering why I spent so much time with this guy, its because I have low self-esteem, and because it got especially bad over the last six months. 

In addition, my little brother developed schizophrenia in October, and he was even more critical of me about stupid things, and it was made worse because, rather than take or accept it, I would get really mad at him and sometimes criticize him back (which I never ever did before.) I know thats not RPW, but it would be things like this: In December, as my little brother got sicker and no medication helped, I began the grieving process. I was crying all the time. He offered to fill up a bath. Sounds nice, right? Well, I accidentally drained it and didnt notice because I was crying over my little brother losing his future (which had looked so bright), and he came up to yell at me and put me down for that. I ended up breaking down crying.

So. Not a good relationship. Learned many things and am working on my self-esteem before I get into a new one, otherwise Ill just end up with the same kind of Bad Captain.

I got home today and found two cards with gifts from his sister and mom. 

I knew they would send graduation gifts, so I bought each of them a $25 gift card to  a coffee shop and a store they like, respectively, and sent it to them as a sweet gift. I had hoped that would be taken as a thank-you, but because they were so close to Mothers Day, Im not sure.

Should I send them a thank you note? I want to be no contact with the guy, Im so serious about ending it, but I dont want to be rude.

If so, how do I do it?

More background: The mom and I had a close relationship (she was really excited about me getting married/becoming a mom and that I was with him), while the sister was more like him (shes a GREAT wife and mother, but is not very friendly/personable. She and him would sometimes put my down together.)",1

I'm not sure why or how they are expecting straight men to stop talking about what they find attractive in the opposite sex. 

Women are quite unapologetic about their preferences and will often let you know about their minimum height requirements ( which tend to be stricter and less flexible than men's preferences). how they like men with facial hair ( 1/4 men can't grow a beard ), their ideal penis size, etc.. Anyone who has been on dating apps knows how "" in your face "" women can be when [talking about a man's physique](https://i.redd.it/rsqzruu8axk21.jpg). Men's feelings aren't really taken into consideration here. You're just supposed to come to terms with your physical image and draw your self-esteem from somewhere else. 

Men, on the other hand, are expected to play by a different set of rules. You have to bite your tongue when talking about your ideal weight or any other feature that you find attractive. Anything you say can be interpreted as "" putting pressure on women""  or "" perpetuating an unrealistic standard of beauty "".

Why is there a need to coddle women and protect them from how men view them? where is that same concern for men who drew the short straw in the looks department? Isn't the subtext a bit sexist? like men should be able to handle it but women can't?",1

3432,3433,"Issues with dressing feminine and my boyfriend's reactionsHi RPW, I'm 18 and my boyfriend is 20. We have been dating for two years.
I have been lurking the sub for awhile now and just recently (~4 months I'd say) switched my wardrobe from jeans, crop tops, and sneakers, to more feminine clothing such as dresses, heels, jewelry etc. This style change has made me instantly more confident and in tune with my femininity. I never thought I'd love dresses this much!

However, I'm having a problem with how my boyfriend has reacted to these changes. It's not like he is telling me what and what not to wear - he says he likes me in everything. However, I've been having some self-esteem issues when it comes to his reactions.
Whenever I wear tight leggings or jeans (I will every once in awhile now), he goes crazy over it and talks about how good/sexy I look. But I've noticed that when I wear my dresses that make me feel beautiful/feminine, he rarely ever comments. This is confusing me because here on RPW I keep reading that high value men appreciate a modestly dressed feminine woman, but I get wayyy more of a reaction from my bf when I'm at my least confident clothing-wise (jeans/leggings).

Honestly, it makes me pretty sad. For instance, I came to his house the other day wearing my hair in a messy bun, leggings, a tanktop and a jean jacket, and he said ""Wow, you look like you took a few extra minutes to get ready this morning"" and I was instantly confused? Then when I wear a long, flowy dress and my hair down and makeup done CRICKETS  It's driving me insane!

My mother passed away from cancer when I was quite young so my brother and I mostly raised ourselves. Due to this, I never really got to observe and learn how to run a household as a woman.

3283,3284,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

In fact they are considered the ultimate privileged class so it's okay to say as nasty shit as possible to them and even encouraged in a lot of cases.

Yes it's a load of shit, but this is how they justify it. I was talking about this ages ago but I believe that feminists especially convince themselves men are evil because if they didn't they would feel horrible about the things they know they've done to men in the past. I think this is also why they're so hostile to the idea of people even on this sub even talking about women abusing men because it makes them uncomfortable.

3610,3611,"The Dual Mating Strategies of Men and WomenAlpha Fucks and Beta Bucks is a well documented phenomenon in the Red Pill. Its the so called dual mating strategy that describes a womans instinct to seek sexual opportunities from the alpha (Alpha Fucks) and provisioning opportunities from the beta (Beta Bucks.) It seems generally assumed in the sphere that this strategy is exclusive to women, so this will be my brief attempt to show that a dual mating strategy is also present in men.

Across the sphere we see RP men constantly admitting their dual mating strategies. We want to fuck hoes, and marry virgins (low n-counts.) We want a lady in the streets, and a freak in the sheets. Men seek sexual opportunities from the whores, and provisioning opportunities from the virgins. Sigmund Freud expressed this dual mating strategy in his Madonna/Whore Complex: the tendency in men to view any particular woman as either a Madonna or a Whore. Madonnas (dont think of the superstar by this same name, it will confuse you) are women we perceive as pure, submissive, obedient, and faithful. Whores are women we perceive as sluts, large n-count, tattoo-ridden, disobedient, and unfaithful. History is full of men who were in love with their Madonna wives, only to cheat on them with a Whore. In fact many RP players have made careers out of fucking hoes only to eventually marry a woman they perceive as a Madonna. We all carry this Madonna/Whore instinct inside of us, and its quite clearly a dual-mating strategy, if we care to admit it.

This dual-mating strategy for both men and women may be a result of pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution societies. The findings of evolutionary psychology suggest that before the Agricultural Revolution sex in humanity was far more polygamous, liberal and free. People tended to sleep around for various reasons without taboo or stigma. Theres a lot in our biology that is evidence of this. This doesnt mean a womans hypergamy wasnt in effect, it just means being a hoe wasnt looked down upon. If this is true its safe to assume that women were hoes for a very long period of time. And this would explain our natural attraction to hoes. Further, pre-Agricultural Revolution, there was no such thing as property, assets, and marriage.

Post-agricultural revolution introduced property, assets, and marriage, and this changed sexual relationships forever. People began to think heavily about guarantying their property and resources was passed on to their progeny. Men became interested in women who could guarantee this bequeathment, and women became interested in men who would share their resources. Suddenly virgins and beta men became more attractive. The forces of this new social pressure conditioned women to look for men who could provide provisioning (betas), and those same forces conditioned men to seek women who could be trusted with their resources (Madonnas.) Virgins can be trusted with property and assets more than whores, and beta men can be relied upon to share their resources more than alphas. In this hypothesis, a dual-mating strategy evolved in both men and women out of our ancient past of free and unbridled sex (pre-Agricultural Revolution) and the relatively recent development of commitment sex (post-Agricultural Revolution.)

In the RP theres this idea that you must maintain alpha-ness in your relationships at the expense of beta-ness, so that your wife doesnt cuck or leave you. While theres obvious truth to this, we should condition this view against our own dual mating strategy. In the life of a man, a virgin is perceived to be a prize. Sure, nothing turns us on more than a whore, and some married men will fuck them given the opportunity, but many wont. Many married men will stay faithful to their Madonna, even though she doesnt turn them on like a Whore. Understood in this way, we can see that while women may be attracted to Alphas, for them the prize might very well be a Beta. This is why we teach comfort tests. And while some women in relationships will still fuck the Alphas, many of them wont, and will stay faithful to their Beta. AF/BB is not a black and white line, its just an evolved tendency in women, just like the Madonna/Whore complex is an evolved tendency in men. But neither of these tendencies dictate with any certainty how a particular man or woman will act. This is not an excuse for a man to be a little bitch, a real RP man knows how to be both Alpha and Beta.

I admit that the theory of AF/BB and Madonna/Whore instincts evolving out of a pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution society might simply be conjecture. But, the evidence that men have a dual mating strategy (like women) is overwhelmingly evident and universal.",1

3191,3192,"I played the game, and I lost it. Need advice.Hello everyone! I have been around this red pill topic for a while now, I read the book ""Rational Male"" as many of you and since then, I've been looking for more info on that... I read  ""The Way of Men"" too, pretty good book I'd say, not about relationship, but about menship overall, and also I am watching\\reading what people like Richard Cooper say, so I think that I am in this sphere.

&#x200B;

So, the reason is why I am posting here is my recent approbation of the GAME in reality, and how I lost it... Point at my fails correctly though, I am kinda interested in where I lost it.

&#x200B;

I have a girlfriend, we met about half a year ago, wintertime, during ice-skating, I just saw her and noticed that she is hanging out by herself, so I came and propose to glide together, after that I said that she might add my phone to her phonebook, so we can spend some time together someday, the same night she texted me.

&#x200B;

We were calling eachother for a while, hang out and stuff, untill we kissed and then our hanging became dating, everything was alright... 

&#x200B;

Then after a month or so, I start trying the Rational Male arsenal on her, and then... everything went wrong. No connection, no laughing, no easy conversation and stuff, at some point she said that I changed, that something is wrong with me, that self-isolation shit killed our spark completely(we didn't meet in person for two weeks or so and the worst part is that I am not really want to see her at the time), meaning that we can't just have an easy smooth phone conversation(I hate talking over the phone btw) it ends up by misunderstanding and her's hanging up(I have some thought that this misunderstanding maybe made up by her, so I can feel guilt for not carrying it properly), then it was kinda time when she didn't call me, and I didn't call her, like who is gonna last in this silent battle, I lost, I called her(cuz I felt like it is my fault) she didn't answer, then she eventually answer and we had a conversation where I reveal the truth, like ""Baby, I am not want to do it with you, I am just trying to follow the rules of game"" she asked me what game, then I opened completely about my behavior and stuff, now I don't know if we break up or not, probably yes(and I know about Iron Rule #7 ofc).

&#x200B;

I understand, it is not right, accouding to Iron Rule #1, but tell me who is fucked up in that scenario? AM I? We had a real nice time together, untill I started to play a game, or did I play it wrong? I confused. z",0

>The print above is an illustration for the tale The Devil of Pope-Fig Island (Tales and Novels in Verse, 1674) by Jean de La Fontaine; the engraving is by Charles Eisen (1762). That particular story is about a reckless bet between a farmer and the devil: the challenge was to prove which of them could better dig furrows in the ground. Unfortunate farmers wife decided to help her husband and showed her lady parts to the devil, complaining that her husband had tried out his claws on her body and had scratched her between the legs. The devil apparently was not at all familiar with the womens anatomy, as he thought that it was some kind of terrible wound; he got scared that his opponent is so mighty, gave up the challenge and run away.",0

They make *zero* effort to preemptively prevent this type of abuse across all of their platforms. As long as they get their money, what do they care; especially if it benefits them with certain content being removed.",0
3209,3210,">The way the concept of a patriarchy is abused genuinely scares me. Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that ""Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world"" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment.
>
>You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world.

Have you ever actually listened to a feminist? No offense, but this reads like your only interactions with feminists come from Ben Shapiro reks feminists!!! or twitter screenshots of crazy people. Most feminists are rational people so if someone shows you a feminist argument that makes no sense on its face then you should be skeptical that theyre not making a straw man. 

For starters, knowledge isnt oppressive, that obviously makes no sense. Second, feminists dont actually believe in a male Illuminati, patriarchy is more of a social order, which leads into the next point, its not designed to be unfalsifiable its just nebulous. Similarly, socialism is where the workers own the means of production right? What percent of corporations would have to become co-ops before were not capitalist anymore? That doesnt mean capitalism and socialism are unfalsifiable, the line is just blurry. For patriarchy, theres not a hard line for what is and isnt, its more of the sum of social interactions that trend a certain way, like women being pressured to start a family instead of focusing on their career. 

> There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues.

>Sociocultural

Like...a system where women are pushed into a homemaker role and men are pushed into a breadwinner role? Like...patriarchy?

>The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.

>The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.

This is a strange point because you can apply this logic to basically anything. Is religion not a belief system because you can make a career out of theology? If you work at a nonprofit because you believe in their mission does that make it not a belief of yours? Nowadays both left wing and right wing people can make a career out of arguing their political beliefs on YouTube, does that make it not a belief anymore? Also, can you honestly say women arent pressured into homemaking anymore? Thats the original reason behind the movements in the 60s and 70s so while progress has definitely been made, why do you think there isnt oppression anymore?

>I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.

""If someone is transitioning from male to a trans woman, it is the core self that makes the passage from one vessel to the next. Our character is divorced from our gender."" I think this sums up a lot. It's never made sense to me to designate and categorize human traits; after all, anyone can and does possess any quality, with any gender.

Where does this leave masculinity and femininity? As mere concepts and ideas that have been associated with sex. Any culture can make up a set of ideas that are ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" to their particular social structure. Releasing the need to live up to social standards and ideas about gender frees one to live truer to their human self, their most moral ideal.

5144,5145,"Feminist Stance on Sex Robots / Robosexuality?Throwaway Account because I feel more comfortable this way.

So we've experienced some pretty rapid evolution in robotics technology the past few years, to the point where sex robots are slowly becoming a reality, rather than just a bi-product of science-fiction.

Being a robosexual myself, I've always wondered:

What is the general consensus about sex robots or the attraction to robots in general in feminism? I've barely found articles discussing those topics in depth, let alone feminist ones.

Feel free to ask for clarification if needed.

&#x200B;

EDIT: A question's been asked as to how one distinguishes robosexuality from objectophilia.

It's cerainly a good question, so it's not gonna be that easy to answer.

I can't speak for all robosexuals, but in the robosexual community I frequent the most, they generally enjoy the reveal of a human actually being a robot. Think of Terminator-like reveals where there is damage to the skin, showing that the person you thought you knew actually just a near-perfect replica of a human, designed to either blend in with or serve humanity.

I've also heard the claims that a big part of robosexuality is objectification, specifically of women. While there's a sub-group in the robosexual community that enjoys the idea of being turned into a machine designed for sexual contact., consent plays a big part for most of these types of robosexuals. They want to be turned into a machine. (There's also a sub-group that enjoys forceful conversion of people into robots; I personally don't enjoy that, but who am I to kink-shame.)

**A big part for many robosexuals isn't the objectification of the feminine/masculine, it's the feminization/masculinization of objects. Giving life to the impersonal of the modern era.**

&#x200B;

EDIT2: Many people mentioned consent, so I'll add a footnote here. Most people (there's always bad eggs trying to force people to roleplay or whatever, they are swiftly banned) in the robosexual community value consent highly. It's one of the big parts about the fetish even. **We don't find that robots just don't provide consent, it's more that robots always consent** because their sex-drive is infinite. At least until they run out of battery.",0

Frankly, he's being paranoid and buying into the fear that the media has been shoving down everyone's throat.

He can't reasonably expect you to not kiss him for months on end, even a year or longer. I commend you for going as long as you have and for the level of respect that you've been showing him. Good job! 

If he understands how you feel and still insists on the no-kiss/hug policy, ask him how long does he anticipate it to last. What exact guidelines is he going off of? Is it purely what makes him feel safe, his emotions, or is he basing his decision off facts? Is he deducing or listening to other people? 

Your action will depend on the answers. I would not want to continue a relationship with someone who's paranoid. I would not want to continue a relationship with someone who easily believes what others say. I would want to be with an intelligent, healthy person who questions just about everything and verifies information before drawing to conclusion and especially before making a decision that involves or affects other people.",0

> I really feel dismissed and I feel like he's prioritizing his desires over mine.

First, it's irrelevant who makes more money, if you're not keeping your income separate. I make 20k more than my husband and I don't get to use that in arguments.

Second, it feels like he's prioritizing his wants over yours, because it's true. He wants what he wants, not what you want and it's as simple as that. I highly doubt he sees this as a sign of disregard or dismissal. He just wants some blinds and you already have a table. 

If you want to make progress on this issue, particularly if it's recurring and not just this one thing, you need to *calmly* explain how this makes you feel. This was his ex's table and you don't like it and have been wanting to replace it for years, to his refusal, and now you especially don't want to take it to a new house. You clearly have the expendable income and you've wanted to replace the table for longer than he's wanted blinds. You'd really like to get the table and make blinds the next big purchase. Perhaps you can sell the current table and put that money toward it. I also think it's worth mentioning that his response came off as really dismissive. 

The key here is to politely refuse to go pick up the blinds before talking about it, so you don't just end up with new blinds. Then calmly tell him how you feel without assuming he intended any of it. Then work together to reach a compromise. If you can't get the table now, because there's some reason the blinds must come first, then when can you? Can you start setting money aside with his blessing?",0

346,347,"So here is the thing.

The power of women are closely related to their ability to manipulate men.

A woman of high marriage value has social status and is given attention by men, who want to make her happy.

This marriage value peaks in her mid twenties. Her social status peaks even earlier.

As she gets older her manage value and social status comes less from her potential to make a good partner and more from her accomplishments, one of which should be becoming part of a successful family unit. Having a successful husband and children should add to her status. By 40 her oldest child could be 20.

Feminists seek to have power independent of their potential as a partner and of their attractiveness.

They want women to occupy a privileged social position *because they are women*! They want to retain that power for longer, at the expense of younger, more attractive women.

This is an effort to mitigate the consequences of life choices and to gain power independent of the men in their family. Of course they want media with frumpy, powerful women.

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The problem is not ""them being whores"". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT.


The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

MGTOW is becoming the norm.Based on the number of cases, studies and articles in power imbalance, in divorce cases, in percentages of relationships/marriages failing, in double standards, the adele divorce case, the Johnny Depp case... men have realized the following:

1 - The term *SIMP* has achieved a global status (i would not be surprised that it would be included in the dictionary sometime in the future). This means that a conscious realization has occurred, and for it having such a mass appeal worldwide, it means that it isn't just cultural relativism/subjectivism. Millions of men have suffered through the dichotomy of -> Conquering Women = Suffering, otherwise the term *SIMP* needn't be so sucessful;

2 - With the pragmatic, yet flawed, #METOO movement, men have spoken how much they suffered from this view of trying to be with women. This point with 1 has something in common: Something is really all fucked concerning approaching women. ""*This shouldn't be so difficult...so why is it? Is it me that's the problem?"";*

3 - Seeing so many men suffering from this exact way (and it not need mattering if a man is a 2/10 or a 10/10. Suffering from women is human condition on heterosexual men, it seems) and ourselves just being tired of trying and being better ourselves everyday to reach that goal of having everlasting love with a woman, we reach a conclusion: *Something is definitely not right about relationships/women nowadays* (otherwise there wouldn't be so many niche groups like mgtow/men's rights/whereareallthegoodmen. It's reactionary and even error theory assuming that ""*we're all losers and incels"". Correlation doesn't mean Causation*, however, when that correlation continues to go on without stopping, a conclusion has to be made);

4 - With such a conclusion, we go searching for more information: We find books (the manipulated men, the rational male, the works of Briffault), we find articles (divorce rapes, cheating scandals, emotional bullying cases), and, eventually, this kind of subreddit, MGTOW (maybe TRP). With the axioms that these subreddits apply...well, they just make sense. Everything fits. We start to connect the pieces. Briffaults's Law, Hypergamy, Monkey Branching, abandoning relationships for no reason, Shit Tests...It's impossible for this to be just me! Every guy i've known has suffered through the exact same way. So we start talking to our male friends... and we all agree on these premisses.

5 - We, naturally, keep reading and being informed about this. We start living without the necessity of having a girlfriend, a woman in our lives, and just stop (or limit) our necessity of approaching women. We start to live more. We are more sane. We are healthier (some of us even go to the gym!). We start taking care of ourselves for ourselves. We start not caring about social media.

6 - Now that we are a better person and know these truths about modernity, and are simply better not caring about women (although this is really difficult and only a select few can outright not have that human condition pull on women), we start not giving a crap. Women start complaining that we are not paying attention or that we have become lazy. Feminism and social media start using debilitating words like *Incel, Loser* or *Beta* to shame test us (like we haven't predicted that by this point). You know, a typical Strawmen/Ad Hominem.

7 - The cycle repeats here. Now, with our knowledge about this concern, we appropriate other males that give attention to other females to have sexual needs validated (onlyfans, twitch girls, youtube girls, e-girls) and call them by reason, to wake them up. ""Why do you think that onlyfans exploded? It's not because they can't get employability or good jobs. It's not because it's ""difficult"" out there. Prosmicuity and sexual themes have exploded in the past decade, and females are the bread winner. They can have their cake and eat it. They can have more sexual partners and be paid for it, without having any beneficial labour for the rest of society. They can go on any social dating app and just pick. *You are NOT going to have sex with her*.""

6270,6271,Men don't approach anymore ...I hear this quite often by women complaining they don't get approached and it begs the question: are men that bad today? The reason why a man will not approach women is because he had negative past experiences. He has tried several times and failed which makes him even less reluctant to make the next move. I firmly believe this explains why the majority of men don't approach anymore.,0

My biggest frustration comes from the fact that women are often given the responsibility of contraception. Birth control pills, IUDS, tying tubes, the morning after pill. Men who are sexually active should not have to be asked to put a condom on, even when women are using another form of BC. If both parties agree not to use condoms, that needs to be agreed to as the follow-up. I'm sick of feeling bad for men who say condoms don't feel as good, completely ignoring the suffering women go through to be the responsible party. Let's also not ignore the cost. If you don't wear a condom, you should have to *at least* pay for half of the morning after pill. This drives me mad. I pay for period supplies and BC pills, monthly.

Bad hygiene is something that people will unanimously judge you poorly for and for good reason, take that away and youre already leaps and bounds better off.

Step 2, start dieting and exercising. Quarantine is one of the best times to do this.

This ""Red pill"" ""traditional"" man, was the one that dumped me! And you know what was his reason?? That I'm ""too serious"".

In his words precisely: ""I know you want to settle down, and have kids in a couple of years..and I'm not ready for this"" (he was in his late 20s / almost 30 if that matters) He also said he wanted to try dating other women - basically seeing if he can find someone hotter.

So here you have a real life example of the Red pill men.. Uncapable of emotions..only caring about looks..and not willing to raise a family..

I loved him, was willing to drop everything for him, settle down,.. And he's the one that wasn't ready.. 


Red pill is the worst thing that has happened to me... I can't believe I fell for it...I lost almost all of my friends over it as well, because I defended my ex and his beliefs about genders / race...

Until that happened...and I realised it was all bullshit...I can't believe he's still a part of that community after what he's done to me...

All of this has pushed me in a hardcore depression... I'm starting to doubt men are even capable of having feelings...


Anyway...just wanted to get this off my chest.....this was my wake up call...and now I'm trying to fix years of being brainwashed..


TL; DR: A red pilled man dumped me for being ""too serious"", and ""wanting a family"" sometime in the future..",0

Do you have friends that are girls? Talk to them on how to improve your style. If not, then you can ask a girlfriend of one of your friends.


Be confident, talk crisply and clearly. Before you try to get a girlfriend, I'd suggest getting girl-friends. Since you're working, ask on of your girl coworkers out for coffee or something (specify its not a date and just as friends).


You need to get confident with talking to girls and touching them. Learning to differentiate between a friendly touch and a flirty one is very important.


Be genuinely nice, dont try and fake a personality. Often if the girl-friend actually likes you they set you up with one of their friends.",0

Re Porn: I have noticed my fantasies are more erotic and less extreme. I think the porn was having a negative effect on me that I didnt notice and moving me away from what was erotic and felt good to just high stimulus.

**Separation:**

I am scared of letting go in case I regret it. I was holding onto the relationships and that was driving a lot of the negative thought patterns. I havent let go fully yet but Im feeling a lot less guilt/responsibility for her emotions. I am still feeling some and it is changing my behavior but I feel like Im making progress here.

Struggling with frustration ex's ongoing shit. She is adversarial and it's only negative on our daughter. She accuses me of shit that isn't true, attacks me for no reason and blames me for everything negative. I have been trying a few different ways of dealing with it but the more she realizes I'm not coming back, the worse it gets.

**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*

I feel like Im rehashing the same shit and not fully internalizing it. Academically understanding something but not able to integrate it into my life. Probably just need time and to pay attendant to the progress I am making. Also, I keep worrying someone on MRP will call me out for not making enough progress. That is outside my locus of control and not something I should worry about but really Im worried because I dont feel like Im making enough progress. Hence my plan to revisit the progress I am making.

u/BarracudaRP post, helped me understand why I feel simultaneously like Im faking it and authentic, also he articulated a thought I hadnt been able to which is that that Im doing this to save myself not because its authentically me. Im still driven by wanting to change myself, which considering what Im like is probably a good thing for now.

*Mood*  still low mood more than I would like, I had about two weeks where I was feeling good, I am still consistently feeling much better than I was and I think this will improve. Today I was feeling bad and thinking about how I would post it here and someone would save me, somehow make it better. Then I just let myself feel bad, I didnt have to do anything with that emotion. I felt immediate much better and free, I still dont feel great today but that letting go of needing to fix it and of the caretaking was a big improvement. Links into below:

*Feelings covert contract*  last week u/Blarg_Risen pointed out that Im not depressed but that I have (among other things) a covert contract around feeling sad. I have been thinking a lot about this and was playing out a skit in my head when I saw just how deep the covert contract is:

I was at my Dads grave and was sad

* My partner (who I dont even have in real life) in this skit came up and hugged me/supported me  took care of me
* I realized the emotion I was imagining was more about eliciting a care response from her than actual sadness and I realized how far I have come from freely expressing myself. I need others validation for my emotions so much more deeply than I thought.
* Then I thought about expressing my sadness without trying to elicit a response from anybody and that felt freeing.
* Then I got to the bit Im struggling with, I want to be able to express my authentic emotions around others and I do want them to hear them in an appropriate way (e.g. not laugh) and to connect over this. Im not sure how I get to this point, is it somewhere I can get to?

*Point of origin*  Im still trying to be happy by making life good rather than me good. Every now and again I feel like my life can be whatever I make it and that feels awesome. This can very easily turn to the Shame ->overwhelm cycle below.

I have a strong through pattern of me not meeting my own expectations -> shame -> overwhelm -> give up/seek caretaking. Comparing myself to others very often triggers this.

Im slowly starting to see emotions are independent of any reactions to the issue. E.g. I was having some emotion about my dad (missing him) then I thought I should do what would make him proud this is the first time (I think) that I have caught myself in this. I realized that my missing him was completely separate to my actions and that I want to make myself proud, separate to that, I miss him.

I still want someone to love me, Im still scared of being alone, I dont think Ill be ok with bad emotions etc.

**Misc.**

Currently Im living at my moms house, the lawyer has advised I stay here until custody is settled as it gives us several advantages and preempts any false accusations from ex. The house is on a corner and basically subdivided with an entry on each street, if I did a few things it would be subdivided. I am considering staying in the other house for 1-2 years after the custody is sorted as it would be good for my daughter and save me time and money (I would still pay rent but cheaper than I could get something equivalent for), if I rented something else I would have to move to a cheaper area and it would be further away from daughters childcare/ex etc. Objectively living there would help me move towards my goals but Im feeling resistance toward it. Im currently reading the monogamous to your mom chapter of NMMNG and I dont think its that as she doesnt try and leech any emotions, doesnt over step boundaries and just generally that chapter didnt resonate with me either time I read it (defense mechanism?). I think its because I imagine bringing girls back and Im living next door to my mom but why do I give a shit what they think? If I was advising a friend I would say, live there, make progress towards your goals and when you have achieved xyz (I have some specific ones in mind) then you will have the money to afford a place where you want. Who gives a shit what other people think, but Im not advising a friend and I cant separate the issues in my head here.",0

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

&#x200B;

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

Yeah, right cause the first person a girl wants to see after a quarantine is a random fucking stranger they ""met"" on a dating app, Jesus Christ. There's no guarantee you'll meet a girl after the quarantine is over and the quarantine isn't gonna be over anytime soon. You're being delusional and naive. There's no treatment for COVID-19 and there won't be a vaccine for another 12-18 months and yet we're acting like the situation right now is a temporary one, it's not. Get used to it. Either you're making actual moves and meeting people (obviously not in a crowded area), and accept youre taking a risk, or you're not.

5895,5896,"This is a good question OP... I hope we can get some feminists perspectives on addressing this, as there are feminists who do not think like this (sadly they are not the ones in power). Let me show a case in point:

So what you said has real effects and is not just theory. For example feminists blocking the only ever male welfare officer at university in the ENTIRE UK. Making a campaign against him so he stepped down and it never went ahead:

>Olivia Bailey, NUS national women's officer, said: ""Discrimination against men on the basis of gender is so unusual as to be non-existent, so what exactly will a men's society do?"" ""To suggest that men need a specific space to be 'men' is ludicrous, when everywhere you turn you will find male-dominated spaces,"" she added.

I mean just one rebuttal to that is men are a minority in university. In education an example of flat out sexism and institutional sexism at an international scale (which she denies is):

>Throughout the OECD Teachers mark girls higher for IDENTICAL work to boys. Furthermore, a boy will receive 1/3 higher grade in reading tests if the teacher does not know he is a boy (OECD) From teachers give girls higher grades despite boys objectively getting higher test scores

SOURCE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers\_mark\_girls\_higher\_for\_identical\_work\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/ght5dj/teachers_mark_girls_higher_for_identical_work_to/)

Someone with some sense:

>As Sarah McCulloch, the female treasurer of the MENS society at Manchester puts it: ""It's important that everyone be included in the discussion about how to create a more equal and fair society, and I don't believe t**hat we will achieve true equality by allowing men to tag along with the women's liberation movement  men have their own problems.""**

So I have learned some feminists are critical of modern feminism and do actually not like this idea of unidirectional power dynamics with men being oppressors and women being victims and patriachy being responsible for womens individual actions (and mens)... this type of feminism needs to raise up and be the loudest voice because at the moment feminism has gone mad. I mean decreeing air conditioning is sexist, sleep is sexist etc.",0
3716,3717,"I find the BBC to be quite woke so thought it was heartening to see them report on this. But ...

No mention of the fact that in primary school its almost 100% female teachers and in secondary school also the vast majority of teachers are female. Could this lead to the mark discrimination?

Also no mention of how it might impact education and prospects for these young boys, in fact just the opposite with this line:

It also raised questions about whether this really benefited girls.

So boys get discriminated against in a way that disengages them from education but is it bad for the girls?

Then the final paragraph which takes away from the whole article - theres no what can we do to fix this or wider discussion of the issues that boys face, but instead a quick mention that girls dont live up their ability in STEM, even when theyre better than boys.",0

Her own words = Women have one mission in life: to be beautiful. When one gets old, one must learn how to break mirrors. I am very gently expecting to die

I saw her in name in a post about historical mistresses and looked her up. She started out in a poor family and worked as a maid. She ran away with a boyfriend, found a sponsor, revamped her image, and completely changed her life all because men wanted her. She had all kinds of lovers including powerful men and got to live in luxury. Women didnt have the same opportunities back then to grow businesses or get an education but beauty was the female equivalent to having power.

Nowadays, women have more opportunities to be independent and get a career but I feel like thats made people oblivious to the idea that appearances still matter a lot for women. I actually feel like the stakes are higher nowadays. Now, you have to be educated AND still attractive. Also, beauty standards have become stricter. With plastic surgery, makeup, growth of modeling/fashion industry, social media, etc. its kinda sad and funny that this woman would probably only be considered a normie/Becky-lite nowadays.",1

3278,3279,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

&#x200B;

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

she gets back to back job from him, she started attracting kangana with that
negative intention . we the public not that fooled, we can see all how it
started, when it started and why it started. if kangana have accepted to do
movies with anurag, then taapsee wouldn't have got her got father and wouldn't
be that big month to attract kangana. kangana rejection has benefit to taapsee
so, she should be thankful to her rather attracting by saying she needs double

she felt kind of secured when anurag gave her a job back to back, and she felt
why not i took that opportunity to attract kangana so, that movie mafia gang
will be delighted and get job form them , which every actress wishes for. just
being a star is not enough, every heroine wants to be on the top, which is
obvious. that's how she become a bootlicker of movie mafia and wanted to be in
karan's good book list. by attracting kangana is the fastest way to get a job
from movie mafia cuz movie mafia gangs hate kangana's brutal honest and pure
hearted. so, taapsee use that tool intentionally. that is her strategy or plan
to get role from them.  
  
  
  
honestly, who doesn't want to be in karan johar's movie accept kangana.
taapsee should stop attracting kangana cuz she is losing her fan followers day
by day including myself. the truth of the matter is. movie mafia gangs never
let any outsider heroine to be on the top place. taapsee should know that by
now. and to become a famous movie mafia don't look for talent but if you pay
them tax 30% form your earning , then you become famous and get adornments
deals, but they never put outsider heroine on the top cuz that position only
belongs to nepo kids in their world. taapsee should know how the movie mafia
play games with outsiders.

1032,1033,"Girls want sex too, youre the one that messes it up.&#x200B;

Its very easy today with the (justified) rise of sexual value/marketplace  thinking to get stuck in this frame of thought about women and sex where we assume all hot girls have a shit ton of amazing options (that are better than us).

While this may even be true in a lot of cases, Im not sure its a frame that really serves us as men when it comes to approaching new girls and escalating things sexually. 

You never know where shes at in her desire and life.  Some girls are getting ready to go out tonight really hoping they meet a cool good looking guy.  They arent ALL bombarded by promoters, bottles, rich guy yacht party offers etc. just because theyre beautiful.

So whats the point? The point is that often times girls want to casually date and hookup but we as men fuck it up for them.  

We do this by projecting all these things onto her life without even meeting the girl.  

We do this by judging girls and calling them sluts if they sleep around.  We create an environment where she cant relax and worries (even more than she already did) about being judged by people and especially you. 

Lets try a new approach, the frame of curiosity. If youre going to assume something about her assume that shes a little bit lonely and is EXCITED to meet an awesome dude (hopefully you are one and are working on yourself).  

It may not be the truth, but it will help you approach her with a better vibe and will help you drop some of the negative assumptions that dont serve you at all.

5797,5798,"How to handle intimacy changes due to Covid-19 at my man's request**(Update: We talked about it, and as it turns out we were both waiting for the other person to say they felt okay with the boundary being dissolved. This sounds so silly now, but I guess me asking him if he still wants something doesn't communicate how I feel about it. He can't look after my needs properly if I don't tell him how I feel. We're resuming the intimacy as we're both on the same page about what's safe for us, problem solved!)**

My boyfriend and I have been together for \~9 months, and we love each other. The last time we saw each other ""normally"" before things got serious in our state (e.g. lockdowns began) was in mid-March. Since then, I have been at his place one time (toward the end of March) because he lives with his father at the moment, and they both have been vigilant about not allowing anybody else at the house. Both of them have been able to return to work safely as of the second week of May. We're still seeing each other on the weekends, like clockwork -- just in my part of town, or at an outdoor midpoint we can both get to such as a state park. And fortunately, no one in either of our social circles has tested positive, and neither have we.

The main struggle I'm having is this: Since mid-March, at his request, we have not kissed on the lips/made out. Our intimacy has not gone past hugging or cuddling, and even then it's not prolonged. Keep in mind, we had not gone past making out ever in our relationship, mainly because both of us have been moving slowly for our own reasons. I am big on giving and receiving physical touch, particularly through physical intimacy, so to have this part of our relationship almost disappear for two months has been really hard for me. I know he's having a hard time too for the same reason, but every time I've asked him what he thinks, he's stated that he doesn't like having this boundary, but he hasn't changed his mind.

My question is: I've never once nagged him or tried to manipulate him into changing his mind about this. I know he's just using his judgment to try and keep me safe, since he's told me that he's more worried about spreading the virus to me (his county has way more cases than mine). I've known him for almost a year before we got together, and I do trust him: He's not abusive or controlling or on some power trip by shutting kissing down. And I know that once things calm down, and he feels we're both safe enough, our physical intimacy will come back with a fury. **But I've never been in a healthy LTR for this long. So I've never really had a relationship before where I have to trust a man unconditionally with a temporary change that (1) I'm chafing against like crazy, and (2) don't how long I'll have to go along with. This, I think, is the root of the issue. As a RPW, what should I do?**",0

**TL;DR: it's easier to be super mean, to be an asshole online behind anonymity than it is in real life, facing the other person.**

if a guy picks a girl apart for her looks or even for her personality, regardless of her attractiveness, on the internet his opinion immediately looses value.

men who are worthy to listen to won't spend all of their time online. they live their lives, have fun, meet new people. not that every men in real life are decent, actually you can't trust any man regardless where you meet him. not until he proves himself to be normal for a long time. and even then you have to be prepared that he will turn out to be insane. there are many examples for that.

but still online it seems like there are even more assholes and they don't even try to hide that. guys online truly show their true nature bc it's easy to be a dick online without facing the other person. but believe me the majority of men online, let them be from reddit or twitter or whatever site, they wouldn't be this vocal about their distaste about women's appearance or personality. most of them would keep to themselves bc they don't have real life friends and they are too coward to speak up. which is for the better.

I mean sure there are guys who are vocally assholes both online and in real life. but still the majority of online guys who criticise women wouldn't say a word in real life. in real life you have to look into someone's eyes and just say the words. and that's fucking hard to do so. online you can just put your bullshit out there and even find groups where you know your bullshit will be approved. in real life these losers would risk losing face if they would openly criticise women.

these assholes would probably lose face in real life bc then everyone would see how they look. bc let's be real these online guys are not Chads they are just losers who aren't physically that attractive though I'm not saying they are all smelly neckbeards. but they are not Chads lol. they are not 10s.

so a guy talking shit about a becky, or normie for not being a stacy will be looked down bc wtf man you are not a Chad or not even a idk Brad. and yet they pick on a girl who is minding her business? get fucked.

also guys who are online too much are brainwashed and have false expectation of beauty. they only/mostly see stacies bc you can only post your photo if you are absolutely perfect and even then you will be picked apart. some beckies can get away with it if they give off hot or cute vibes. and even these stacies, beckies use angles, good lighting, even photoshop to maximise their looks.

so don't give a damn about other subs like gonewild, butterface, etc. while facial bone structure is really really important there are many cute-the-girl-next-door girls who would be seen ugly online while in real life they would be wanted.",1

3702,3703,"Former textiles guy here. Generally what this says about wool/cotton/poly is true but many caveats.

**Poly doesnt absorb**- true the material itself doesnt absorb, but youll notice most sportswear  worm when youre sweaty is poly. Why?  Because you can extrude the thread in high-surface area threads break up surface tension or hollow threads that use capillary action to which away.  (Imagine the play dough machine squeezing out a  macaroni shape vs a star shape noodle, the star shape will wick better.  Poly is also quicker to dry because it doesnt hold onto the water due to absorption.  

Poly is also more durable.  This is because the fibers are smoother and dont create the self-abrasive friction that wears down yarns as much as other fibers.  Wool & cotton are both rough under a microscope.

**Cotton comparison vs wool.** - there are several types of cotton on the market.  The 2 main differences in the material are 1) fineness and 2) long staple vs short staple.  The construction also contributes to feel and utility greatly, but  t-shirts are usually a type of knit (vs weave)

The video covers Fineness a bit.  In addition to contributing to hand feel it also improves color-fastness. This is because the ratio of surface area to fiber thickness is high and the dye can more fully saturate.

Staple length:  the cotton staple is the fiber and different varieties have different lengths.  These fibers are twisted together to create a yarn (thread) and then it is knitted into your shirt. Long staple fibers can be tangled better because they can twist around each other more times. This means 1) you can get finer yarns. And 2) you have less hairs poking out of the yarn as there are less fiber ends to create the yarn.  Both contribute to the smoothness of the yarn.  Smoother yarn has better hand feel. This height number of tangles also means the yarn strength is better AND the smoother yarn means more durable than cheaper yarns (as with poly) Types of long staple yarn are Pima, Supima, sea island and Egyptian (high caution on Egyptian as there has been a lot of fraud there). In my opinion supima is the best, its the same species as pima but better growing methods and its guaranteed USA grown, so better oversight. 

Low staple cotton is generally lower quality crop with less certifications, so it is cheaper.

**recommendations**

If youre going to get a wool/cotton blend shit, my recommendation is merino/supima blend

If you want the best 100% cotton shirt: supima cotton

For a cheaper option that is more durable and has wicking and anti wrinkle properties, look for cotton/poly blends.  Ratios of 60/40 or 70/30.  Again my preference would be for supima/poly blend but in general the poly will make the cotton feel softer.",0

I learned that some states in the US had eugenics programs where people were sterilized against their will back in the 40's and 50's. Since then, the government has been using more covert methods to manipulate fertility and hormone levels. Misinformation through the use of media is also one of those methods. Never has there been a population more confused about sex and sexual relationships than we are today.

6171,6172,"i knew it !! i knew that you were gonna ask me that as your next question.
see. i clearly told you that the examples that i gave dont prove anything. so
i did not imply that choosing or not choosing are related to normal or natural
behaviour. its just that the statistics speak something. no one really knows
what it is, all the way down to the fundamentals of sexuality. and by the way,
bestiality may be just normal or natural. or it maybe just disgusting. but who
knows ? maybe bestiality is just another form of sexual orientation ! buuuut.
why should people be against it then ?? simple. because even though a person
may wanna have sex with an animal, there is no way of knowing whether the
animal also wants to have sex with the person. i told you in that previous
comment that consensual relationships are nobody's business. animals cant give
consent, coz neither can we understand them nor can they understand us. you
can end up raping the animal. so that closes the chapter on bestiality and it
must be forbidden. next question that you may wanna ask is: pedophilia ! so,
again, pedophilia may just be another form of sexual orientation. who knows ?
buuut again ! a child is not really capable of giving consent, isnt it ?
that's why we have laws in most countries about the age of consent. some
places its 16 some 18 blah blah blah. but its not 12 years old anywhere, i
guess. coz most kids are just too immature at that age, even though different
kids start maturing at different ages. no one actually knows what the right
age is. maybe we'll never know. but its reasonable to assume that kids are
mature by the time they are like 15 or 16 so that is the widely accepted age
range of consent in many countries. but it is always dangerous for a pedophile
to assume that a kid that he wants to have sex with can give him/her consent,
bcoz you dont really know if the child is old enough to think about it. thats
why sex with children should also be forbidden, well until they reach the age
of maturity, as i have been saying all along. so if an adult wants to have sex
with an animal or a child, but never acts upon his/her desires, well then that
is fine and he/she should not be criminalized in society. there is a
difference between a pedophile and a child molester. but anyway, you get my
point, i hope. now i know the next question you are probably gonna ask, but
ill wait for your reply to see if thats what it is. lol",1

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BIOLOGY

We start with 10 studies ([1](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf), [2](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/Larson%20et%20al.,%20in%20press%20hormones%20and%20behavior%202012.pdf), [3](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/larson%20pillsworth%20haselton%202012%20plosone.pdf), [4](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Lieberman_Pillsworth_Haselton_2010_Kin_affiliation_across_cycle.pdf), [5](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/DeBruine_et_al_2010_Response_to_Harris.pdf), [6](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulation_voice.pdf), [7](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Durante_Li_Haselton_2008_Change_in_dress_across_cycle.pdf), [8](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/dress_to_impress.pdf), [9](https://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/08/02/haselton-gangestad/), [10](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) \-PDFs-) that show us that a woman has two types of male preferences, depending on the period of her menstrual cycle. The terms ""Alpha male"" (defined as sexually attractive) and ""Beta male"" (defined as sexually unattractive but a good long-term partner) will be used to summarize these studies.

&#x200B;

**DEEP DESIRE**

During her ovulation period (a period of about 6 days when a woman is fertile, normally 14 days after the end of her period), a woman will :

&#x200B;

\- be much more attracted to very masculine men (with good genes): square jaw, deep voice, body odor (pheromones), muscles... The Alpha male

\- be more likely to cheat on her spouse if she perceives him as a Beta male and if she has the opportunity to do so with an Alpha male

\- on the other hand, not wanting to go anywhere else to see if she's in a relationship with an Alpha male...

\- be much more critical of her man (if Beta) by describing him as jealous, possessive and by reproaching him for redoubling his efforts and kindness to keep her (hence the importance of never appearing to be taken for granted in her eyes). The women who declare to be in couple with an Alpha report on average that he makes less effort and is less attentive than the Beta males, but do not complain about it.

\- feel more attractive than the rest of the time and therefore perceive themselves as having more value than their spouse, if they consider him Beta (which may lead to deception to satisfy their hypersexual desire)

\- have a greater desire to go out where she is likely to meet men and tend to dress sexier and more provocatively than usual

\- still declare that they are consistently happy in their relationship despite a clear change in sexual preference during their menstrual cycle

&#x200B;

Abstract summary: If you plan to go for a little ride in Amsterdam with your mates, avoid doing it during your girlfriend's ovulation period.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL PARTNER**

Women are therefore constantly confronted with the dilemma of choosing a man, Alpha or Beta, to try to best meet their desires. The best (most sought-after) partner is of course the rare combination of the two, the handsome, exciting male who is exciting and stable enough to look forward to long-term prospects. They will logically choose, as long as they can, the Alpha male and try to retain him (""he's afraid to commit!""). Some will still try to get with a ""nice"" guy, i.e. sexually unattractive (because physically not at the level and with a weak character), hoping that he will become virile, an option that has even less chance of success than the first one.

&#x200B;

Men also face this same dichotomy, this time described as the ""Madonna and Whore complex"". We are looking for a beautiful, faithful and stable woman. Problem, the ""good"" girls are ugly and therefore not exciting, and the hot ones are unstable. The perfect woman is therefore also the rare combination of mother and whore.

&#x200B;

**THE IDEAL COUPLE**

The ideals of both sexes often end up together (stable handsome guy and stable beautiful girl), leaving only incomplete individuals available on the market, trying to find the perfect person, without realizing that they themselves are not perfect in the eyes of the opposite sex (the stable guy who thinks he is perfect but will never understand that he is not exciting, or the beautiful girl who is unpresentable because of her emotional instability and unbearable sluttiness).

&#x200B;

Extrapolating strongly, the winning couple is the Alpha male / beautiful virgin girl marriage and the loser couple is the single mother / near virgin Beta male marriage. The worst strategy is to marry a slut (divorcing costs an arm) while the female equivalent (having a kid with an unstable Alpha who will leave during pregnancy) obviously has no consequences for the woman. It's even a very viable strategy used by some (getting the right genes and then finding a good father).

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: PHYSICAL

Physical appearance is the eliminatory criterion for both men and women. The myth of women being less visual than men is perpetuated by society, suggesting that personality is the predominant criterion since others are morally unacceptable (because attracted by the physical=superficial, and attracted by money=profitable).

&#x200B;

**A BEAUTIFUL BOY**

Women's tastes are generally less eclectic than those of men (who may like tall, short, thin, ""girls with shapes"", blondes, brunettes, etc.). The archetype of the favourite guy is the classic tall, handsome dark brown. Non-exhaustive list: 1m80+, piercing eyes, tanned, impeccable hairline, slight beard, thin with a bit of muscle, broad shoulders, protruding jaw, cheekbones a bit visible, broad smile.

&#x200B;

Feminist propaganda wants us to believe that female beauty standards are delusional when in reality they are the most demanding women in terms of physique. Like any person who is devoid of logic and can only see life in a binary way (""you're feminist or misogynist!""), they often find it hard to be neutral: a man is either beautiful or ugly. The dating site OKCupid shows that 80% of men are physically rated below average, i.e. ugly, by women. Conversely, the distribution of scores for women (rated by men) is logically close to the Gauss curve (bell curve: majority of women in the average, and as many ugly as beautiful). Another interesting but obvious fact: the better-looking you are, the more answers you get and the more requests you receive.

&#x200B;

**FRIENDZONE IS AN UGLY THING**

By definition, friendzone is the situation where a girl considers us a friend when we are interested in more. There are only two possible cases:

&#x200B;

\- The majority of cases of friendzone: you're super nice but not good enough physically. So you are a friend. It's exactly as if we find a girl interesting, intelligent, funny... but ugly. No matter what she does, we will never have desire for her, because desire is not negotiable. She's still a good friend, but that's all.

\- Second rare but possible case: you're a pussy. It happens that a girl finds you physically attractive, but your submissive behaviour is so unbearable to her that she can't consider anything with you. You may have sex with her once or twice, but it is impossible for her to project herself into the future with such a baltringue.

&#x200B;

**THE BASTARD IS ABOVE ALL A GOOD-LOOKING GUY...**

Except for a few social cases (generally having grown up without a father, physically or spiritually absent), women are not particularly attracted to assholes who lie, cheat, are violent or impulsive. They simply like male men, i.e. the right balance between the nice submissive who gets trampled on without flinching and the scumbag who attacks others for free. The guy who doesn't say yes to everything, who knows how to say no when he has to, and not just to piss people off.

&#x200B;

The thing is, the good-looking guy can afford to be a bastard because women are, no matter what, physically attracted to him and hope he'll go easy on them. The better-looking you are, the more you can afford to behave badly. The uglier you are, the less you will be tolerated. To be desired by being ugly and morally a shit, you need the combination of an incredible vice (violence, threats, manipulation, extreme domination) and a psychologically destroyed woman who can attach herself to this type of man. The whore in love with her pimp, so to speak.

&#x200B;

# WHAT WOMEN WANT: BEHAVIOUR

The behaviour that appeals to women is not witchy and can be summed up in one sentence: live for yourself and stop being a coward.

&#x200B;

**INITIATIVE AND SOCIABILITY**

Women like to go out, to show off, to see people, while many men can be content to stay at home quietly. They are attracted by extroverts and like guys who offer and take initiative. In short, ""we're moving tonight, I suggest you go here"" is infinitely less of a pain in the ass than the tiresome ""what are we going to do, darling? . Don't hesitate to impose yourself. If you feel like doing something, invite directly instead of proposing.

&#x200B;

The men who struggle with this part are often people who don't get out much and have to force themselves to look ""normal"". They don't actually have the spontaneity to propose interesting outings since they don't usually do them themselves. On the contrary, a guy who has a rich social life, in addition to increasing his chances of meeting people, will simply ask a girl to go to one of his activities. He will be in his element, comfortable, natural. He will not have changed his life for her, but will have invited her to integrate his already existing universe.

&#x200B;

**MASCULINITY**

[A study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188691500210X) shows that women, regardless of their experience and age, are attracted to narcissists (who looks alike comes together?). The self-centred man lives for himself, is often active and generally has ambition (at least to do what he likes, which is already quite good). The woman adores this type of man and hopes that he will include her, and only her, in his life project. The worst faggot is the guy who stops his hobbies/passions/dating as soon as he is in a relationship. Fortunately, he will often be punished by his girlfriend, who will dump him after a few months of relationship.

&#x200B;

Express your opinions and defend your positions. Stop trying to appear perfect in the eyes of women (and people in general), because perfect means boring, drunk and submissive. It doesn't mean you have to provoke clashes out of nowhere (we leave that up to women), but if something annoys you, if you disagree with it, say so, express it. Stop freaking out at the thought that she's going to leave you or lose interest in you. If she leaves, too bad, there will be others. But that's unlikely to happen if you stay fair. That's the paradox that the ""good guys"" will never understand: when you set your limits, she gets wet, because she sees that you have character and balls.

**YOU SHOULD KNOW**

One comment that comes up over and over again with men is, ""But why doesn't she say she wants a man like that? It would be easier! . If masculinity needs to be explained to a man, it's because he's the wrong man. Explaining to a man how to behave kills desire and attraction. How can a woman ask a man to be dominant in bed? It's abbreviated. If he does it, it won't be natural, and he'll end up doing what she wanted anyway. If he doesn't, she will be frustrated because her desire will not be fulfilled. A woman can therefore never express a desire for domination.

&#x200B;

Women keep saying that they want a ""natural"" guy, which means naturally masculine. No one wants to be with someone who simulates behaviour. Imagine not being able to get your girlfriend to come and she says, ""Don't worry, I'll fake it next time. It's worse! [Women like men who take risks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12237). A girl can say no if she doesn't like something, but she will never be able to fully express a desire or risk ruining the magic of spontaneity. So you have to guess her expectations, and for that, nothing better than testing (and it's fun too).

&#x200B;

**STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND TAKE ACTION**

Since a woman can never fully confess her desire under pain of killing him, the worst thing you can do is to cook her to make her confess what she wants. Probably the dumbest thing you can do is ask permission to kiss. Even if she wants to, she'll say no. You have to try it in a convenient, fairly isolated moment, at a time when there is sexual tension (don't be like the pseudo-street dickheads on the internet who try to kiss a girl after 10 minutes, it's ridiculous).

&#x200B;

If a girl gives you her number through her friends, don't send her a message asking why. Stop being silly, she's obviously interested in you. It's already a big effort for a girl to initiate contact, so take over the flirting if you're interested. Same thing if a girl accepts an invitation to your house one-on-one, it's not to play scrabble. You think she's gonna show up at a guy she doesn't like? If she comes to you and you don't try anything, it's a rejection in her mind because you didn't get her message. In her mind, you're either a loser or you're not interested.

Her own words = Women have one mission in life: to be beautiful. When one gets old, one must learn how to break mirrors. I am very gently expecting to die

I saw her in name in a post about historical mistresses and looked her up. She started out in a poor family and worked as a maid. She ran away with a boyfriend, found a sponsor, revamped her image, and completely changed her life all because men wanted her. She had all kinds of lovers including powerful men and got to live in luxury. Women didnt have the same opportunities back then to grow businesses or get an education but beauty was the female equivalent to having power.

Nowadays, women have more opportunities to be independent and get a career but I feel like thats made people oblivious to the idea that appearances still matter a lot for women. I actually feel like the stakes are higher nowadays. Now, you have to be educated AND still attractive. Also, beauty standards have become stricter. With plastic surgery, makeup, growth of modeling/fashion industry, social media, etc. its kinda sad and funny that this woman would probably only be considered a normie/Becky-lite nowadays.",1
4065,4066,"I Have Been Doing Cold Approach For 2 Years Now: This Is How I Went From Kissless Handholdless Virgin To 15 Lays In 1 Month&#x200B;

About 3 years ago, I was a 29 year old Asian guy with only a couple months to go before I turned 30, working at a Big 3 Accounting Firm, and I was realizing that I was unhappy and miserable, working long hours at all times of the day and night and spending all my free time playing Overwatch, and Dota 2

And despite earning good money, I had a house and some savings, I just knew my life was NOWHERE near where I wanted it to be or thought it SHOULD be, despite all the years of hard work because I was FOREVER ALONE. I was still a virgin at age 29. A kissless handholdless virgin I just wanted to take the time to finally get this off my chest since I have nothing better to do during the quarantine.

I soon decided, with the help of an epiphany while reading an article on RedPill titled HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD that this was not the life for me and that I would need to start approaching girls and learning game to have any hope of losing my virginity before 30

I didn't want to become a 100+ lay gigachad like the article outlined:

* I just wanted to experience what other guys experienced in college that I missed out on.
* I just wanted to have someone I could share my hopes and struggles with, someone I could come home to and hug if I had a bad day.
* I just wanted to have some fun before I get married and start a family

Was that really too much to ask?

So I quickly began to learn about game and seduction and browsed Reddit and other forums almost daily to get hyped up and learn how to do cold approach. I soon discovered, however, that I had bitten off far more than I could chew

I met up with a white guy I met online who seemed equally as motivated as me to go out and approach and we went out to several bars and clubs together. Every time we went out, he would always go home with a new girl, mostly Asian girls Im not proud of it, but I was extremely jealous since none of these girls gave me any kind of IOIs or other signs of attraction when I approached, and stopped going out with him. Now, I realize it's because he went to the gym a lot and always had a nice haircut, but back then, It was kind of ridiculous how Id approach girl after girl and get one word answers and a GO AWAY vibe the entire conversation and he would come in a few minutes later and THE SAME GIRL would be smiling and asking him questions about himself, it felt like he didnt even need to do any work to get laid

At this point, I was watching pickup videos from or reading articles on how to get girls on an almost daily basis, trying to study and learn all the latest game techniques. It felt like I hit a brick wall. This was SOOO much harder than I thought it would be. The HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article specifically said that women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one but that didnt seem to be the case. I was a 55 Asian guy competing with 60+ white guys at every club I went to and it felt like no matter what I said, no girls were even willing to have an actual conversation with me. This is after 100+ approaches so I knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort.

So reluctantly, after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality, I invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since I figured I was already watching so many of their videos, and its only fair that I pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing.

For those of you thinking about going to a PUA Bootcamp, be very careful you don't waste all your money like I did. This particular company did not give a single FUCK about me other than my money. My instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach, which I already knew how to do, and every time I asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive, he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off. I asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers, always giving some woo woo answer about how I needed to have outcome independence and have more fun. It was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance, even though they teach that looks don't matter.

I finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches. It was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and I just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts. At this point, I was so desperate that I tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date Over the next couple of years, I became obsessed with getting good with girls, which certainly kept me going, but it also caused some problems

I went out with so many wingmen, hoping to find that gold nugget, that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall, but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5'10"", no exceptions. I read an article on Reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot. Girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when I asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together. That's when it hit me that I didn't know as much as I thought I did and that there was a lot more to learn.

The bad news is, all this rejection was not good for my mental health. I started to wonder if maybe a short Asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate I was seriously considering moving to Thailand or The Philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife

But finally, I found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and I immersed myself in his training He was 57 and Asian, so a short Asian like me.

The first thing he told me was that my hairstyle, fashion, and body language were all shit and unless I fix them first, nothing else would work. Now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice I read like the HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article which convinced me that looks dont matter but I decided to give it a shot. I got a blazer and chinos from Zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch. I didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable IMMEDIATELY. Suddenly, they would hang in and listen to every word I had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave. One girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when I asked her to grab a drink with me! I was SOOO HAPPY, it felt like everything changed.

Next, he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt. This was really hard for me because I spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer, always hunched over. I even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after I started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients. Again, I noticed immediate results. I actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob! No lay thought because of last minute resistance

The one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety. I had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all. He had me watch episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white. This did not come easy but I worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable. This turned out to be the tipping point and I finally started getting laid regularly when I go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before. Overall, I'm very happy to have fucked 15 girls. I know that's not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it's a big improvement over ZERO.

Thats kind of the level Im at right now. The girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but Ive gotten a 7 before, mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing. The quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily, I already had a plate I was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan, so Im not wanting for sex, just spending my days reading and learning as much as I can about working out and nutrition since I got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up. Hope everyone reading this is safe and got some value from my post. Just needed to get this off my chest before work starts up again.",1

I haven't posted for a month. Classic ego-driven, I don't need this shit, it's dragging me down thinking. I'm incapable of holding myself to account at this point, even without you guys 'dragging me down' and I can see I'm a few weeks from never posting again so it's time to get back at it before it's too late.

I'm vaping and drinking more than ever. I'm being a total weak-ass shit about this. It's bugging me endlessly and I can't seem to find the will to make a serious effort just for me. Why bother with anything if I can't do the real basic shit? I won't drink this week (with a target of at least four weeks) and I will stop vaping as soon as I post this. It's a shame I can only do it to please a bunch of strangers on the internet, but it worked last time and I won't go back again. Pathetic whichever way you look at it but I'll take it.

These failures lead easily to lots of thinking about what I want in life, what my purpose and mission is, am I simply content to be billy beta and the plough horse. Despite what I might think consciously, deep down I don't think I believe in myself or that I have value or I can do better or deserve it.

I do have the power to change that and my 'pleasure' seeking and self-sabotaging ways but it's going to take a long time, I ain't no Horns. I'll use the reality this place presents, as unpleasant as it can be, as best I can.

Lock-down is working in my favour and will for a couple more months. I'm saving lots of time and money, my weight is down a couple of Kg, I'm almost hitting 50% protein, I'm eating almost no junk.

Physically I feel like shit and exercise is a struggle. I'm weak and the causes are clear because it isn't sleep or diet. I finally really, really accepted I'm skinny fat, hence the good work on the diet. Ditto on being weak, first steps there are the vaping and drinking and simply not having a day off from doing something and sucking up the soreness.

Relationships are good, surprisingly so considering lockdown, but I won't fool myself I still don't have a ton of work to do, especially when it comes to application rather than knowledge.",0

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

Or Shield Hero. You got high ranking nobles (in a matriarchy) abusing their powers, and at the same time others who aren't. You got average people and slaves. Men or womens, doesn't matter. And of it's been teased that enemies from their invasion waves have at their heads heroes which we have seen 4: a male samurai, a male reaper, a female arch mage, and a female dagger/fan user. Very varied female representarton all around.

Or Bofuri. Main cast is mainly female. One of the rival guild has a female guildmaster who has no confidence in herself. Maple's a dim-witted idiot who'se habit of EATING the obstacles on her way somehow made her the most powerful being imaginable... But she's still a naive idiot under the Demon Lord appearance.

In Soul Land (Korean manwha/show), there's a varied amount of males and females all different, with flaws and all, and the discrimination is based entirely on if they're humans or magical beasts, or class warfare. Womens are pretty powerful in that story.

But if you would try those shows here, they would all be criticised for their depictions of womens. Because outrage scammers needs to scam so that their blackmail gives them another paycheck on their patreon.",0

504,505,"Homosexuality : is it natural ?[Âõ∞]

Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .

The Question that should be asked is,
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?

Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him
& His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .

i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.

the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23¬∞c ,30
minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.

Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.

Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?

it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation.

The Bible clearly says ,he changed the ""TRUTH"" of God into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking
around with broken wrists .

since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.

Scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,We have seen that ""Thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.

So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.

There is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created.",1

3689,3690,"What I believe to be going on here is you have noticed how the media grabs the attention of people, largely young and immature that dont have developed emotions, portray romantic situations. When we are young and the person we like has a boyfriend or girlfriend, we often think of the other as a bad person so we arent guilty for wanting someone that is committed/involved/seeing to someone else, especially when we arent getting any attention. When media targets this audience, they portray this situation to be true, affirming the viewers feeling of their interests partner as a dick. We love feeling right. While this is largely portrayed as a young man having interest in a girl whos ex or partner is a dick (Scott pilgrim vs the world for example), it is portrayed both ways. Often, the love interest male is dating a pretty girl that isnt right for him (Im looking at you Taylor swift in you belong with me). Essentially, it is hoping that the audience watches this to affirm their feelings, so they consume the rest of the medium (movie, album, etc). It reflects a me not we mentality when it comes to love. The subject in both gendered roles is only thinking about what they want, disregarding the other person of interests choice in their actual partner. I studied what love actually is using a lot of philosophical backing, and I can say with confidence this is more possession than it is love, which is what we feel in our high school days and thats fine. Many young people confuse the two, as long as our life experience enable us to move on and exist with self love and eventual outward love. In short, its a product of immaturity more than sexism, but sexism can definitely spin this situation into something else when it comes to relationships. All that being said, people dont always choose people that are good for them. No one is perfect theres a very interesting psychological theory that analyses the people we find appealing romantically, and how it relates to our past. People are likely to date those that give us familiar types of suffering as opposed to those that show us new types. For example, if your parents always yelled at you and 
You never got over it, you would date someone that yelled to communicate adversity. Same thing with passive aggression, violence, and communication. We choose the familiar, unless we actively take steps to avoid it. And when someone we want to date chooses someone who gives them the suffering they are used to, it justifies the feelings I previously discussed EVEN MORE. (Heres a really cool video on the suffering bit, its far from hard science but is a really interesting theory on relationship dynamics as it relates to developmental psychology: https://youtu.be/Hvysy11716g). To summarize, love triangles are common and no one thinks wow my love interest didnt choose me, but thats fine! Until they love themselves.

You are number 5, our ""modern phenomenon"" user. 

Number 5's - here is the reality. The SMP isn't ""worse"", it has evolved. OP as a conservative muslim probably views women's sexual liberation as an abomination, and therefore views the observation that SOME women are hedonistic turbo sluts to mean ALL women are hedonistic turbo sluts. But if you are a woman (especially a young one) who believes (or in many cultures, the reality is) you were/are relegated to some kind of second class citizen, hedonistic turbo-slut seems pretty cool.

This is not a NAWALT argument. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that its just our turn. They can never be our whores. So, the only reason that can upset you is because of your ego.

The problem is not ""them being whores"". Because in reality, they are not all whores (at least not as many people still figuring it out believe) They are AWALT.


The key is to be having fun with a DGAF attitude towards anything that isnt helping you get to where you want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. 

Experience new shit and be happy, I assure you that is the simplest path. Make your life as interesting as possible and you wont have time to waste worrying about people (or even culture) that brings negativity.

manipulate these rules. here we're talking about men being falsely accused,
but soon we will see men getting out of actual rape cases by saying, they were
falsely accused.  
i guess the only answer here is that the laws should be really strict, things
shouldn't be done emotionally but mentally and logically by having proper
investigation, and most importantly, government should invest more on street
cameras. there should be a working camera in each and every single street, and
they should also encourage people for installing cameras in there homes, cars

5892,5893,"On the perception that feminism blames men for everything.This is a common sticking point and a common criticism of feminism coming from MRA-aligned people. Here is my best attempt to summarize the issue:

Most feminists seem to believe that patriarchy and misogyny are the only valid lens through which to look at mens issues. The ideas of anti-male sexism and misandry are a taboo in feminism. Any double standards that seem to negatively affect men are rationalized as misogyny backfiring. If you talk about an issue where men get the short end of the stick (such as bias in child custody proceedings), feminists are quick to point out that, in fact, patriarchy is responsible for this. If you talk about how men are shamed for showing emotions (by both men and women), feminists are quick to point out that this is a result of misogyny  that showing emotion is considered feminine and thus inferior. Therefore the blame falls on patriarchy again. 

To a non-feminist, this leads to the impression that feminists are blaming men (as a class) for all gender-based unfairness. In fact, the eagerness with which feminists blame patriarchy suggests that they think its very important that everyone understands exactly where the blame should lie (on men).

Feminists, do you agree with the perception that you blame men, as a class, for most (or all) gender-based unfairness? Do you think that its important to acknowledge that the blame lies on men? Where do you think the balance falls between class-based and individual repsonsibility?

Is it possible for feminists and progressive MRA's to reconcile this difference of opinion?",0

But in general I think it's harder to feel sympathy for them without context because it's impossible to conjure up reasonable explanations for their behaviour. Someone gets arrested for drugs? Maybe it was just a little weed and they were racially targeted. Someone is arrested for grand larceny? Maybe they fell in with a bad crowd and didn't have a choice. Or maybe they were pulling a robin hood and stealing from the rich. There are lots of crimes where you can manufacture justifications that give a bit of morality to their actions (even if that's not the case), but it's nearly impossible to conjure up any sort of moral explanation for a sex crime.",0

5542,5543,"Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**Submissive Girls, Part II: More Fun With Submissive Girls**

Lets say you are a Confident, Dominant Guy and you are out and about in the Sexual Marketplace.  **You are looking for submissive girls and they are hoping you find them.**  Note I say they are hoping you find them.  Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  

I have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  
So lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.

**Gaming Submissive Girls**

Keep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  

If she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  

I do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  

*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *""No guy has ever talked to me like this before!""*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. 
 
**Chatting Her Up.**

**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*

**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  

I also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  

As an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.

**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:

*I know your secret.*

Then I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}

I have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  

Now, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.
One of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to ""force"" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own ""Disney"" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*

**Takeaways**

-Submissive girls are fun.

-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.

-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  

-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**

^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.  Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue.

^2  Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever).  Dont over plan.  

^3  Mild condescension is ok.  Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.  Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid.  Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.",1

3400,3401,"The sexual selection mechanism, which is how you feel in terms of attraction, doesnt select for this, so you need to make conscious modern world alterations to the primal strategy of sexual selection.

Youre attracted to a guy at the top of some hierarchy, or at least who presents honest signals of being there. This is why psychopaths are attractive, bad boys, the best at sport, celebrities, confident frame-controller, etc.

Men do not start at the top of the dominance hierarchy, they work for it.
Unlike the past, men have a good chance at getting there without being murdered or put in their place by those already at the top. Sort of more fair, where hard work is more likely to pay off at the very least.

So, you dont need to aim for guys already at the top (or at the best youve ever had and expect you can get), which is some consolation. Since you can invest in a guy and he can get there after the fact. Yeah it sucks that you cant just wait at the finish line. But, you can make a difference to a mans life and allow him the frame, be feminine for him and allow him to maintain and steadily grow into a more ideal man which benefits you and him. Not manipulation, but simply being feminine brings out qualities for a man. Win-win.

If he is to be this level of attractive to you, he will get the attention of other women. So youll try to get commitment and manipulate him to ensure your security and this will generate beta behaviour from him if he gives in, its called poison dripping and makes him worse so that you feel secure. And then hell be unattractive. Or he doesnt give in, but maybe he sleeps around and you dont want that either. Win-lose in short term maybe, lose-lose in long term definitely 

And on and on, there is no ideal for you, no perfect situation without a compromise.

*Conclusion*: figure out what you want to compromise, to sacrifice, and what you value most. What is the ideal situation, what is the ideal man? Do you have the red pill knowledge to simulate the potential downfalls and to figure out if that ideal situation is realistic.

Make your goal specific in that way.
Figure out if it is realistic, and achievable.",0

5788,5789,"You are never going to get the reassurance of the subjective experience of others. I'm married and I've been with my partner for a decade. Is he with me because I make incredible lasagna? Because he loves me in a cosmic, unchangeable way? Because he wants me in a lustful way? Because I was convenient? Well, yes. All of that, at times, and probably more reasons. I honestly have no idea most of the time. A decade-long thing doesn't last on lust alone. So it's a bit of everything, I'm guessing, but I really have no way of measuring his subjective experience of me. So, for my peace of mind, I don't really try to do that. I am not, inherently, interested in how his brain engages with his choice to be married to me, it's just not that important. I can't know it, it wouldn't change anything material about my experiences with him, and it really is none of my business anyway. 

Other people's experience of me isn't my business. 

All I can control, all I have power over, is how I am treated and what kinds of experiences I want in my life. That's it. I can solicit behaviors, I can reject behaviors, but ultimately that's all I can sway. My husband treats me like he loves me in a cosmic way. He treats me like he wants me sexually. He treats me like I make great lasagna. And sometimes he treats me like a fixture in his life he doesn't have to question and can just rely on automatically, which I appreciate since I do it too. His behavior matches with my internal set of expectations for how someone who loves me would behave, and he says he loves me, so that's good enough. I don't really need to interrogate if what I think about as love and what he thinks of as love are identical experiences or motivated for the right reasons. The experience of being loved by him *is* acceptable, so that's good enough. 

All anyone can do is tell you and show you their truth. If they tell you they want you and they show you they want you, that's as much as you'll ever get. If they tell you they respect you and they treat you respectfully, that's all you'll ever get. All you can do is set expectations about what level of commitment, love, and respect is required for you to be intimate with someone and go from there. You get to set your expectations for how you want to be treated and people can meet them or not. You further decide to put up with it or not. For now, in human history, you're never going to get to look behind the curtain and see someone's real motivations, to experience their reasoning and desire, to get capital 'T' Truth on how they feel about you. 

Self-esteem is a real kick in the teeth on this one. It is the force that informs you when you're being tolerated as opposed to cherished. It's what tells you that your subjective experience of your beauty is the only thing that matters, that evidence of someone's lust must be a lie. If you hate yourself, you'll never believe that the words and behaviors you're experiencing are truthful because, how could they be? And, really, no one will ever be able to tell you differently because that's the entire toolbox at their disposal. But that's not their failing to impart their truth, that's your inability to read it and accept it. As a result, a lot of people only accept people with nasty, cruel behaviors and words because that feels more real, somehow, or at least offers up something believable. Swing a dead cat and you'll probably hit someone willing to treat you badly and confirm your bad self-assessment. So, yeah, in the most obnoxious way possible, a lot of this comes down to fixing your own internal metrics for the expectations you set, the behaviors you'll tolerate, the evidence you'll find convincing. Which just...sucks. Because that's hard, painful work that takes a long time to internalize. But doing it makes everything so, so much nicer.",0

951,952,"Until I took the blackpillI thought this was supposed to be a term of enlightenment, people on the old incel subs would say ""Feed him a blackpill before he ropes!"" or things similar. But I've seen a lot of posts of self-loathing and suicidal tendencies that tell me otherwise. What I want to know is why? Why do you all have to hate yourselves for something you had no control over? You didn't ask to be born, you didn't ask to exist in this shitty looksist world. It makes no sense to me to beat yourselves up over being alone, especially if your blackpilled and acknowledge there is little you can do in the way of genetics.

I was like you at one point in time; I hated myself and wanted to die for not being able to attract girls. However, that was when I was bluepilled/ redpilled, when I thought I actually had a chance. I truly thought the reason I wasn't attracting girls was because it was all MY FAULT, that wasn't being assertive, charming, charismatic or acting confident enough, not being enough of a haughty douche. Every time I developed a crush on a girl, I truly thought it was something I had control over, and that if I got rejected and saw her with some 6'5"" muscled-out gorilla- looking-man days later, it was because I had fucked up my presentation, that I had my chance with her but I blew it.

Then one day, after the truth had chiseled away at me long enough to finally break me, I had finally became fully blackpilled. I won't go into detail how it happened; it took forever, a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario, best saved for another post. When I took the blackpill though, it was like a tremendous weight had finally been lifted. Not only did I stop hating myself, but I was able to move on and focus on other things that actually made me happy and love myself. I no longer cared what girls or really anyone thought of me; you'll never impress everyone anyway, so why get shook-up over it?

For example, I was at the local archery range the other day, bettering my aim, when an attractive young lady walked in and took a spot near me. Now I'll admit, my natural instincts caused me to let my guard down and let her in my head. I instantly put pressure on myself to shoot really good and not mess up to impress her, which in turn of course stressed me out bad. But then I quickly came to my senses and told to myself, ""Even if I was the human version of Legolas, there's no way I could flatter her. That would only be if I was a 6'5"" muscled-out nordic chad. Hell, I could be complete shit at archery then, and she would be chomping at the bit to come over and assist me, so she could touch and adjust my arms and feel my muscles and shit.""

And just like that, I calmed down, my mental state was restored, and I was able to go back to enjoying myself and focusing on shooting.

Now I know some of you are going to say ""I wish I could have a girl adore me like that."" Or ""I'll never experience being touched romantically and sensually.""

Well, so what? Why should you care if other people don't like you? If you haven't already, you'll come to learn that 90% of the people you meet are just a bunch of miserable dick-assed weirdos who only enjoy putting others down to make themselves feel better about their own shitty ass lives. They are not worth pleasing.

Also, a lot of people won't get to experience a lot of things. Blind people will never get to see their own face. Deaf people will never get to hear their own voice. A few years ago, there was this four-year-old kid in my town who had to have all of his limbs amputated, or else this horrible genetic medical condition  would kill him. Now he will never get to experience walking, running, jumping or playing, or opening his own birthday presents or taking care of himself or anything really for the rest of his life.

My point is, yes life is terrible, yes life is filled with suffering, but that doesn't mean YOU  HAVE to be miserable every second of every day. As a human being, you are capable of many more amazing things than you realize. As a 25 y/o virgin, I have found so many amazing things to do that made me realize just how amazing I am as a person, and they don't involve having a romantic partner; some of these activities are even more enjoyable when you're alone.

Now I'm sure a lot of you are going to say that I'm just copemaxxing or something. Maybe you're right, maybe it is cope, but then again, maybe it's not. After all, some of these things, to me, like going on outdoor adventures, hunting, fishing, and hiking the AT, PCT, and CDT, feel BIGGER than just settling down with a wife and kids and becoming fully domesticated and tethered down like so many other people do. Plus, being single has it's advantages, like having a 0% chance of ruining your life by having a kid on accident.

The bottom line is, you only live once, you might as well try and enjoy life while you still have it. If the ladies don't like you, then don't sweat it. IT is right, no one is entitled to anything, especially if it involves another person. After all, no one here would like being forced to do something against their will. If girls don't pay you any mind, then fuck it! Who needs them? You can't please everyone, so don't even try. Please don't live to try and please other people, does your one-and-only life belong to those assholes, or you? Live for yourself and no one else. When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on it! Normies will say that this is not a healthy mindset, but normies have proven themselves to be full of shit with their so-called ""advice."" Hating yourself and wanting to commit violence against yourself for something you had no say in is not a healthy mindset either.

When someone takes the blackpill it shouldn't mean the end of their life, it should mark the beginning of a new one, filled with self-love and acceptance!

TL;DR: Taking the blackpill should not make you sad, it should be and indication that you are free to live for yourself. It should disarm all of your self-loathing and tell you that most people are horrible and that their opinions are worthless. Do not just LDAR. Save the LDARing for when you're dead, after you've enjoyed your life to the fullest.",0

With this girl there's always sexual tension but I'm not looking for a relationship right now and she knows that. She doesn't want to be my fuck buddy (which I definitely like).

There's always sexual tension between us. She puts her eyes down whenever I make a deep eye contact and touches her hair etc. I've complimented her a couple of times saying you've got a nice perky ass and jokingly spanked it. She laughed when I did it. I touch her at every opportunity like high-five, rubbing her shoulder to console her when I tease her etc but she never touches me back. We have very good flirtation with every opportunity. I just am scared to escalate and spoil it if she turns me down if I go in for a kiss. It'll just make me very low value cos I always tease her saying ""we never get along as a couple"" and trying or going for the kiss would not be congruent",0

If you're asked where you are from, instead of saying, ""I am from Aspen, Colorado"", you clothe the answer with a relevant comment-- you might say, ""I am from Aspen, Colorado, but I can't ski for my life"".

3402,3403,"I, 25M have been a lonely, neckbeard creep all my life. I need help to break from this virginity hell!a bit of a longwinded and touchy one here folks but bear with me.

So Ive gone through so many of these wanna get better phases and it pisses me off. I have all the horrible weaknesses in the world to make dating almost impossible for me. OCD, autism, social anxiety and misophonia. Ive tried PUA and dating sites to disastrous results. The former I didnt know any better about and I regret even trying it.

And with this era of Coronavirus, not going outside has got me to this point. I am an autistic neckbeard creep. And I wanna stop.

Here are some examples of digging myself into a hole:

* I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside
* Im on Disability Welfare
* I have creeped out literally every girl that I have some sort of interest in due to getting obsessive and impatient.
* Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. 
* I am 130kg

I just do not want to be like this anymore. I dont want to keep creeping out everyone I walk past and be pitied like I was all my adulthood.

The worst part? I get panic attacks after hearing crowd noises and applause. This means no concerts, clubs or events. What the fuck am I meant to do here? Thankfully I wear noise-cancelling earphones with pink noise which can let me go to the city without panic.

But enough ranting, I just wonder what I can put in effort in for now while Im stuck at home. What will I be able to do to start living a non-creep life? What things can I attend, how can I get my confidence up? Im basically starting from ground zero here :/

Finally, I wonder if this is even possible? Turning 26, never got remotely in a close relationship in my entire life and being an autist I really worry to see that I can get more mature than identically a 12yo

A friend showed it to me on YouTube. It seems to be widely accepted that a little crazy makes a woman more attractive and interesting, though in reality its not actual crazy so much as it is lack of boundaries or healthy lifestyle that is considered desirable, i.e. habits that are more likely to give men an opportunity to achieve their sexual goals, like a willingness to get loaded and have a threesome. 

However, I think that most people who believe the women only like jerks trope forget that a great many relationships start with people presenting their best selves rather than their real personality with all of its faults. So though it may seem obvious to an outsider that the men are jerks, it may not have been obvious to the women until they were already invested in the relationship.",0

Im embarrassed. It was pathetic and I feel awful that I was so entitled and put so much standards on women, that theyre supposed to be perfect, and one should come along and save me. Disgraceful. 

Women are flawed, and there are bad ones - that doesnt mean they arent beautiful. I have to start seeing women as individuals. Respecting them and respecting myself. 

I probably will never get laid, as I havent done so already. Im not that special, girls dont have to date me or have sex with me. Rather than being bitter about it, and blaming women - Im learning that my mindset is harmful to me and those around me. So, Im content with never having sex or being with a girl, thats their choice to not want me: however, I will love women, not be so entitled and pathetic, and have a healthy mindset for MY happiness. I feel quite good about myself now :)",0

3600,3601,"4 simple Activities/Habbits to develop during quarantine in order to transform yourself.Ive seen people talk about how during these times of uncertainty it is important to love and forgive yourself, to allow yourself to eat snacks and trash foods, to spend *(waste)* your time playing video games and binge watching shitty tv shows and Netflix series.

While I agree that its good to spend some time having fun and enjoying yourself, this is no excuse to let go and consume your free time. Instead, I **urge** you to **PRODUCE** instead of **CONSUME.**

1.	**WORK OUT** - Im hopeful that at least 90% of the active users of this sub have already developed and follow a work-out routine. This goes to the people that are not already working out and especially for those who have been working out and have stopped due to the lockdown. Just get yourself up and do it. It doesnt matter what you do, just go for a walk, a job, run, ride your bike, do some push-ups, burpees, bodyweight squats. There is an abundance of exercises you can do anywhere, anytime. Your gym being closed is NOT an excuse to sit on your couch and get fat while you play Call of Duty or something and eating oreos or other trash foods. 
Work out, your body will thank you, your mind will thank you. Working out relieves stress, improves your cardiovascular health, your immune system, as well as your body and mind altogether. If youre struggling to find a routine to follow during quarantine, feel free to shoot me a PM or Ill post a free home workout program here. 

2.	**Start cooking**  Cooking is fucking amazing. It is one of the most relaxing activities I do on a daily basis. Besides the fact that youre being creative and cooking your own meals which helps avoiding trash foods, snacks etc. It is also a perfect time to listen to an audiobook, a podcast or any other educational/self-improvement video/audio. I find myself being extremely focused when I cook and I absorb any information easily. If youre not into audiobooks/podcasts, just put your favorite tunes and vibe it out. But for real, start cooking your own meals, its great and its not as time consuming as you might think it is.

3.	**Educate yourself**  3 easy suggestions: 1) **Read books.** Any book that seems interesting to you, read it. TRP is the reason I now read books and it has insane benefits for the human brain. It helps me build focus, expand my vocabulary and gain knowledge on a wide spectrum of things (psychology, philosophy, business, finance). It started with The Rational Male and turned into Friedrich fucking Nietzsche and Ancient Greek philosophy. 2) **Take online classes.** There is an abundance of free online classes available. Hell, even watch youtube videos about something and take notes. Its 2020, education is available online and for free. I feel like a moron for wasting 6 years getting 2 university degrees. 3) **Watch documentaries/docuseries instead of TV shows.** Documentaries about anything, serial killers, abuse, gender equality (if you wanna get triggered). Anything is better than watching pointless TV shows. 

4.	**Develop new skill(s)**  On the same note as the above, try to improve yourself by developing a new skill. Two personal examples Im focusing right now are: Learning a new language and experimenting with investing/day trading. But this can be anything, a physical skill (learn how to handstand or smth), play an instrument, learn coding, cooking (see point 2.), fix things, build things, craft etc. Your future self will be glad youve taken the time to develop new skills.

5.	**Meditate**  Its important to train the mind as well. Take time to dose off, give your head some space. Relax and focus on your breathing and how your body feels. Remember that you are the essence living inside the body, so take care of the presence. Remind yourself of what is within and come to peace with it. It will greatly relieve your stress, anxiety, depression, as well as to improve your sleep and attitude in general.

**Epilogue:**

This is the perfect time to work on you. Improve you. Fix you. Transcend you. 

There is no excuse for being lazy, having terrible eating habbits and not taking care of yourself. Remember that one day things will go back to normal. You can be the guy who comes out of this completely transformed. Healthier, better looking, wiser, craftier and maybe even wealthier. 

Do you want to waste your life because there is a global pandemic? Do you wanna come out of this as a loser with no money, like a junkie who will seek cheap dopamine rushes and quick moments of fun? Or do you wanna come out like a stoic roman emperor, ready to take on the world again, fuck his way to the top, ready to make money, lift heavy weights and live life to the fullest? 

**MEMENTO MORI** - *You could leave life right now*. 

Choose wisely.

Here is my [Free Home-Workout routine](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AmJ514tCo8vcgywNMw9mDcJ5NwKP?e=uyQx6w)",0
3688,3689,"Why is the ""Women only like jerks"" thing prevalent or at the very least not applied back?So I've been thinking about this for a bit.  Incels and some better men down on their luck, or guys who dont know better make the comment of ""Girls only like jerks"".  

Now I've thought about this and probably at one point agreed with it without thinking too much.  It's a thing in popular media and sometimes guys who seem like pricks have girlfriends and every wife beater has to have gotten a wife at some point (or else it's just assault).  Doesnt help that I watched a video by (Screamo?  Streamo?  Some variation of that I think it had an exclamation point, he interviewed the republican gun lobbyist who survived a school shooting) that literally had women calling him a jerk and a fuck boy but still saying they'd fuck him (I pulled one bit of salvageable advice out of that but that's another question)

But I've realized a few things (please poke holes if you can)

A) that implies monolithism (which not being that makes it really hard to discuss issues).  I've met some girls who would absolutely not tolerate dickishness

B)  Could be other features.  Most dicks are to some degree at least confident or driven so those are good qualities

C) most guys that say this aren't really guys I'd like to hang out with or classify as nice

But perhaps more importantly, 

D) guys do it too.


There is this thing that I think is just as prevalent in media about a dude defrosting an ice queen for lack of a better word (is that term sexist?  I think it is but languages fails me as I cannot think of a suitable replacement for the platonic ideal).


The women would undoubtedly be a jerk (why does that sound masculine?), or at the very least cold and unemotional.  Through out the movie (using a fictional example here) the hero would defrost her via kindness, witticism or heroism.  And they'd get together.  Now she doesn't necessarily have to be mean but definitely more business and aloof.  Or turning it

In real life I think its definitely a fantasy of most men for the same reasons above.  I know I personally have had crushes on girls who were not the kindest in their interactions with people (or at the very least attraction whether they were just genuinely attractive and my brain ignored the other parts or there ""badness"" made them more attractive).  



Point is that it's a phenomena and something I have personally experienced so I guess ""Guys like bad girls?"".  Not monolithic but it is to my knowledge a thing?


So why is it not generally levied in reverse?  Am I way off on my assumption and this is more a me thing?  Is it patriarchy?  Doe femcels not use this language?  Does if have to do with framing like the most attractive women is the evil one or they are made more attractive through framing?

In my home country, I come across as 'ultra-modern', and in my country of residence, it took me two years to exactly grasp what 'subtle sexism' as opposed to 'overt sexism' looks like. I find it difficult to discuss my issues in the feminist groups I've been part of - their solutions would not touch on the nuances of culture that I experience. 

Online, Reddit as a whole is very US-centric. What has helped me was to join some women-centric groups from my home country - these are not naturally feminist groups, but they give a sense of relatedness. I also follow some accounts on IG from the expat communities. This helps me feel that I'm not alone in my struggles.

One year into an LTR is too early to be pushing for marriage/moving in to ***her*** place in my view.

5356,5357,"Your ability to break the rules is a powerful red pill truthI was sipping morning coffee and going over the worldnews sub when I came upon an article that mentioned how Japan is still reliant on fax machines and shit to report on Covid.  These people are required to go into work just to stamp documents.  Someone in that sub asked ""can't they bring the stamp home?"", which lead to the following response:  

>A question that only someone thats never lived in Japan would ask.

>There doesnt need to be any practical or logical reason for a rule

>Rules no matter how trivial are followed without question

>People actually go into a sort of shock if you violate a rule

>For example my wife once tried to order hot takeaway milk from a Mr Donuts.

>The server explained that you can takeaway coffee etc but not hot milk because you might not drink it right away and it could go bad and then make you sick. Long nonsense discussion

>My wife proceeds to order a hot milk to eat there and asks for an empty takeaway cup. At this point we assumed the server knew what was going to happen next because she gave my wife the milk and the cup without question and there really was only one explanation for wanting the empty cup.

>When my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.

>The sort of rule breaking that my wife just did literally doesnt ever happen in Japan.


This absolutely blew my mind.

Apparently following rules is so burned into their culture, that they wouldn't even consider breaking even minor rules.  

Another comment in the same thread mentions how you can't even order an omelette without rice.  You have to order the omelette with rice, then throw the rice out while the server stares in disbelief .


>Then my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.


Which got me thinking about the blue pill ""rules"" here in north america in context to the red pill (get a gf, get married, get her pregnant, pay her cash and prizes when she's ready to move on, and don't you dare deviate from that path you fucking sonofabitch!).


I realized our ability to say ""fuck this I'm gonna spin plates, avoid marriage, enjoy the decline, etc"" results in the same ""ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah short-circuiting in blue pill programmed individuals.

.


""Seducter, you can't fuck her, she's married!  ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah

.


Not only did I fuck her, but I sent her ass home to the husband who's cooking supper for her and the kids.


Just seeing that comment thread made me really appreciate the freedom that we have.  To be able to break free from society's conditioning and do what we want.  Imagine freezing up in a firestorm of cultural programming and indecisiveness because someone asked you if they could borrow your shovel.

Think about someone youve met who you really enjoy interacting with, who makes you feel good. Im not talking about someone who provides good mental stimulation or debates with you. I specifically want you to think about someone who makes you feel comfortable opening up and discussing anything.

That is a good conversationalist. That is the goal when socializing. Its not to be interesting or funny or the center of attention. Its to make whoever you are speaking to feel comfortable and special.

To be a great conversationalist, you have to shift your focus from your inner thoughts to others outward feelings. Doing so isnt easy and takes some practice, but its absolutely a skill you can develop. 

As another person suggested, the YouTube channel Charisma on Command is EXCELLENT. It helped me hone a lot of the little skills that add up to being a better conversationalist. 

I would specifically recommend the video on Dwayne Johnson. It looks at how withdrawn he used to be and how it made him uninteresting and unappealing to speak with and how he turned it around and became more outgoing and engaging. For me, that video really made me realize how boring I must appear to other people since I was so deep in my head I was rarely even saying enough to keep the conversation going.

5995,5996,"**l am a male victim of fake female rape charges**  
  
there was this girl who came from new delhi to stay at my neighbours house
with her cousins for a few weeks and we accidentally clicked and we began
eating out, watching movies, shopping, etc.  
  
she would call me at night and we would talk and laugh etc. as we stayed in
the same floor , she would directly pop into my house without knocking.  
  
fast forward, i was having a shower after my grindr hookup (a gay guy) went
away, now since i stay alone, i don't worry roaming around in the naked, i was
having my shower and she stood there watching me, the moment i noticed , she
acted as if she accidentally saw it. this was so uncomfortable !!!!  
  
next, i began noticing my underwear being stolen , never had this issue ever.  
  
then this girl began spamming me wierd messages which got me pissed. then she
left back for new delhi, she would video call me late at night in very
revealing outfits and i didn't quite like it. but i never had anything in my
mind so, i ignored it.  
  
the she began repeated visits all the way from new delhi to my neighbours (her
uncle) every fucking weekend , and would simply enter my house.  
  
one day, i was having sex with my new date (a man) , thankfully, i kept the
bedroom locked and this girl knocked it and stood out until i opened it , it
was so displeasing, that we had to dress up fast and act as if we were
drinking and having a good male time together. only to open the door and see
her completely naked ,right in front of my bedroom with me and my male
companion looking in utter shock. she didn't expect another male in the house
since i was the lonely tenant. i realised this girl is a weirdo and i began
locking my doors, would sleep at one of my hookup friends or mates or just
anyone else's house at night on weekends because she would come to visit me,
changed my number, everything.  
  
one fine day, she dropped in with her cousins and began shouting at me at my
house by collecting everyone, and my father visited me all the way from surat
, gujarat that morning, she kept saying everyone that i tricked her and had
sex under the context of relationship and showed screenshots of me on my
whatsapp messenger videos, what's even more surprising is that she took
pictures of me while i was in shower oneday in the naked, she showed our
lengthy conversations at night etc. she found my new number from someone in my
office by visiting and stalking me and sent me threatening messages of
alleging molestation and rape charges against her.  
  
i was so shocked and almost about to cry that i was being a friend to her as
she was in a horrible marriage and having divorce with her now husband
already, and that he used to beat her up and all that.  
  
i decided that's it's enough and i made my mind that i won't take this
atrocious behaviour towards me since my elder brother was himself a victim of
""false rape charges"" against him , i collected the entire world including my
relatives my office mates, my friends all over the digital world, the society
members, and guess what ? **i came out as a gay man because i had no choice**  
  
i opened up about my sexuality and everything to everyone including my parents
, my brothers, my boss, my teachers , everyone !  
i was not going to take this woman's shit anymore.  
  
i showed all my sex chats to the world with all the men i had it with, called
all the guys whom i hooked up with, showed all my pictures of me being gay
ever since i realised my sexuality at age 14 and the bullying i suffered as a
child. i didn't stop there ! i called up my ex and asked him to show the
videos were we kissed, had cosy consented adult time together, showed proofs
of gay bar visits in us , finland, israel and all places that i visited.  
  
and asked her if she wanted to really marry me if i keep having sex with men
and be her husband at the same time, she was even more shocked than she could
ever even dream of !  
  
gay men (90% of the time) are masculine and you would never even know that
they're gay until they say it themselves. most indian gay men by age 35 ,
almost 99% marry women to hide their sexuality. i'm of the remainder 1% who
are proud of themselves.  
  
found out this woman had a child already 5 years younger to me , already.  
  
lesson learnt :  
never even befriend a girl or be her companion in her bad times, you might end
up being called a rapist. lol, i can't even imagine seeing a woman nude , let
alone touching her , i literally keep a hand on the part in the porn where
naked girls are around hot naked men to avoid any visual encounter.  
  
my heart beats out for all my heterosexual brothers who have faced such female
molestation or rape charges, even worse if they ever consensual sex , because
the man is screwed now for life ! i saved myself because i was gay , ya'll
have no hopes !  
i also feel bad for girls who have been victims of rape by men, i won't be
biased at all. women do face more of sexual assaults than us men do, no point
in denial but there are many a times , men are victims of it themselves.  
  
imagine. showing your relatives, your sex videos with other people to prove
your sexuality just **so that nobody calls me a rapist**  
i knew those charges would be useless but once an allegation always is a
charge especially if it's a male. ""woh dekho wo launde ko, shadi shuda aurat
ka rape kiya usne""  
nobody would believe me even if i were to be free from all that legally. took
quick action, saved my family from all that shame .  
  
i'm not ashamed of being a gay man, because i made my life out being called a
chakka, hijda, what not by my own brothers, nobody accepted me not even my
straight bestfriend as i grew up because i trusted them and they ditched me ,
as a result i began engulfing my own self either by suffering it or having sex
with other men who would comfort me or play with me for some days in my
teenage years and support me emotionally and cry lonely in the showers and
beat myself ,cursing being a unlucky shame to the family. while my brothers
who did nothing significant didn't have to prove themselves just because
they're straight.  
  
many of my relatives distanced me since we are a conservative family what
matters is my own family, took no shame of me. my employers know my hardwork,
my friends know my value, my neighbours know my support.  
found immense respect socially. actually ,even more after coming out.  
  
my prayers with all rape victims of whatever gender, even more with the gay
men because nobody even reports it if it has been done out of society. most of
teenage gay men are sexually assaulted by their own heterosexual cousins or
had some encounter. you have no idea the trauma gay men suffer as children
being excluded from the world. drying within, most marry women by adulthood
just so that their parents have their dreams fulfilled , drinking their own
self sacrifice of being at freewill as venom. don't blame them, blame each and
every indian citizen for that.  
imagine being a victim , where court deemed us as criminals, religions
admonished us, families throwing us out, brothers beating us, our mothers love
us but they have no choice .  
  
god bless you if you've read this far. i'm just like your brother, son, begin
accepting us for who we are , this will save a lot of devastation from your
own human fellow being.",1

There are more and more business, dating, lifestyle, and personal transformation gurus than ever before. Selling courses, counseling, and coaching at a heavy price. Most of these experts never sell anything original - it is just watered down concepts and advice sold in a new shiny wrapping. 

I have acquaintances that have bought into pick-up bootcamps, paying 1000 dollars for a weekend - none of them get any better results than the ones that learned through free content and forums on the internet. Some of them are still struggling on the same level they were a couple of years ago. 

I have a close friend that paid the same amount of money for a meditation course. Where he was given a special mantra. He later told me that he found the instructions and his personal mantra on the internet for free.

I paid 12 dollars for Roy Masters meditation audiobook Be Still And Know which you can find for free on YouTube.  

Realize your favorite self-development guru has learned from someone else above them - the real experts. You can learn from these originators at a fraction of the price your favorite guru wants you to pay.   

These self-proclaimed mentors often follow the same format. Many will have a YouTube account in order to generate, leads, traffic, and build up trust with their audience. This is done by giving away free value and content in order to establish their brand. 

Another side effect of giving away free content is that it leaves the potential client with thoughts such as - Well if all this great content is free, imagine what the paid product will do for my life

The truth is that the product being sold to you will likely contain the same information that you can buy as a book on Amazon for a few dollars instead of hundreds and thousands through an online course. 

The YouTube videos will contain a link to a landing page for the product steeped in marketing techniques such as scarcity marketing, big colorful buttons, and graphics. It will contain powerful statements such as:

* Live An Incredible Life...NOW
* Feel Unstoppable In Your Personal and Business Life
* Unleash your Authentic Self

You get the message - whats funny is once you have seen one landing page you have seen them all. Another strategy you will come across is the discrediting of the original source and author. 

Sure all these books and authors are great, but they dont teach you how to take practical steps - which I do

Even well-established success gurus such as Tony Robbins have had personal models. He learned about motivational speaking from Jim Rohn. He learned Neuro-Linguistic-Programming. A powerful system to change habits, emotions, and thoughts, from the co-founder John Grinder. 

He re-packaged NLP and incorporated it into his books and seminars. A Tony Robbins seminar called A Date With Destiny costs 2,000 dollars. 

Richard Bandlers NLP book Make Your Life Great costs 12 dollars. And will contain the same strategies and techniques that Tony Robbins teaches.

So I hope you dont buy into the hype or let them play on your insecurities. Everything you could ever need in terms of guidance and information is out there for free.",0

Anecdata time, to illustrate the issues I see with this sort of surveys (also, the article supports their claims based on data from surveys for the most part, while at the same time linking to a paper that criticizes data from surveys as being misleading...)

Since the COVID-19 thing started, I've been confined with my parents at their house, and my father is still working (fortunately he can do so with his computer), so he wakes up at 7am in the morning and takes the dogs for a walk (if possible) while I prepare breakfast for the two of us (my mother usually wakes up at 9am the earliest). He also takes care of buying and/or preparing the firewood to keep the house warm (not needed as much since 1-2 weeks ago, and I too do my part in this, but you get the idea), keeps the garden in a good state, and fixes most if not all things related to electronics or informatics in the house (so the computers and associated software that allow the three of us to still work from home, the air conditioner...).

He's also responsible for the maintenance for both of their cars, buying the food (and medicines, sanitizers... Everything that needs buying, he is responsible to get, basically) and storing it in the fridge(s) in an organized way, after the three of us decide what we'll be having for lunch/dinner the next 1-2 weeks (he then makes a plan to *when* we'll be having dish to keep the diet somewhat varied and avoid having to cook too much some days, and not at all others, and to avoid over-filling the fridges).

On the other hand, my mother keeps the inside of the house (but nothing else) clean and prepares lunch once every two days (my father does so the other day), while either any of them or I prepare dinner (depending on who is ""more available for the task"").

With the questions presented by the survey, if the article you linked is nything to go by, I would say that in this case my mother would end up being the one my mother would me most of the ""home-schooling"" (if there were any kids), even though my father would be helping a lot by taking work off her shoulders (the time he spends shopping, taking the dogs for a walk, and preparing/fixing all devices that allow the rest of us to do our work comfortably, is time saved up for the rest of us, including for my mother, who could spend it ""home-schooling""). In a similar way, the question:

> Who is currently most responsible for housework, such as cooking and cleaning?

Would be answered such that my father would be doing at the very least as much, if not more, of the housework, if you look only at the part before the colon. However, he technically does less than half of the cooking and cleaning, which may explain discrepancies in their answers.

So, basically, most of it comes down to how you ask the questions and how you present the results, in terms of the conclussions they extract. And it comes down to how each couple/family organizes themselves. I got tons of help from both of my parents when I was younger, and would find it insulting if anyone tried to minimize the work **both of them** did that allowed me to (for example) study at the university, be succesfull in getting a degree, then a master, and later on a PhD and a career. They each did their best and helped tons, in different ways, by talking about how to organize themselves, and playing their own roles within those plans.

This sort of surveys sometimes seem to be looking for specific answers, by looking at how the questions are formulated, and then these answers are usually extrapolated to cover much more than the questions allow to. Thus the way the reports are made, both in terms of the answers themselves and how they are interpreted.",0

4444,4445,"Women have zero interest in sex *compared to a man*.

Women love sex in a relationship with an individual, not in general.

Women just don't care about, nor pursue sex.

If they did, society and culture would look completely different.  Even in ""modern"" super liberal attitude countries you see it.  Women just aren't into it.

Rape wouldn't be a crime is women gave a shit about sex, because women would at worst see bad sex as just a bad date.  You don't see men whining about rape because they had a shitty sexual experience.  Women wouldn't whine about ""cat calling"".  Women wouldn't push the narrative that all men cheat because they will at any given opportunity, unlike women.

If women pursued  sex they would actually, you know, pursue it instead of sitting on their asses waiting to be hit on or swiped on.

And I say this as someone that's fucked dozens of girls and never asked a girl out or approached on in my life.  So you'd think that would discount what I'm saying, but it doesn't.  Luckily, feminists created sluts for people like me, and thank God for feminists creating sluts.

Women evolutionarily cannot just free fuck the world, their jobs are generic selectors.  Even ignoring all that, men have a gigantic sex drive compared to women that have basically zero.  if they had a sex drive, women would be all over boys, but you don't see that.  Women don't really chase men, they sit around and let men chase them.

Some nerdy neckbeard anxiety prone incel will muster of the courage to at least get rejected by a woman, but women never do.

Women don't give a shit about sex.  Not really.  they endlessly whine about how shitty some guy is at sex, and how often do you see men do that?  Rare if ever, because a moist hole is a moist hole.

Whereas women don't think a hard cock is a hard cock, which is why they have 500000 requirements to fuck, whereas a man just requires a woman to be willing and available.",1

6031,6032,"Overall a decent list, but it's typed in a vacuum and not reality. A couple of thoughts as I read through this:

You can apologize for your appearance if you know you look like a schlub. If you were invited to a dinner, and you thought it was only a 6/10 formal thing, and it turned out being an 8/10 formal thing, it's okay to apologize for being slightly underdressed. It could even be what starts a good conversation, although I wouldn't start with it.

And you should apologize for expressing your emotions if the way you express them is harsh or hurtful to those you're expressing them too. I feel like the way this part was written can be interpreted into it being okay to go off on someone or something. No one ever says what they feel about something every time they feel it, the very second they feel it. Things always get bottled up to a degree. The listicle should mention that not being 100% forthright in your emotions is only natural, and that this is not carte blanche approval to erupt unapologetically.

You could conceivably apologize if you're reaching out too often for help. It means you're aware of the other person's time.

IDK. I just think that we shouldn't be afraid to apologize, instead of looking for every justification NOT to do so. Especially under the guise that it makes you look weak, when apologizing (maybe not *for* something, but *that it happened*) can make you more sincere, trustworthy, and considerate. 

I mean, the rest of the list is good, and even those things I called out, I get where the author is coming from. But people notice when nothing is ever your fault. And it's a major red flag.",0

6517,6518,"It's tough having a baby. It will get better. 

I have made a habit of not working beyond finishing dinner or fixing a quick/easy one and putting said food away. I put the children to bed and I do my best to relax/spend time with my husband. I would start adjusting baby's schedule and yours to align with your husband's. Can you put the child in your room to make things easier? Feed the baby and everyone goes back to sleep. 

Pumping while breastfeeding is quite unpleasant. When I did it, I wanted to just give formula. I would stop pumping unless someone needs to watch your LO while you're away. Has baby started solids? That would be beneficial to you. I loved those yogurt melts for my son. Look into baby-led weaning, so that you don't have to sit there and fight him with a spoon. 

7.5+ months is a perfect time to start playdates. Even if you're the parent hosting or watching the children, you can go somewhere like a child friendly coffee house or park to escape. Children love playing outside, on playgrounds, and with toys they don't have at home, even if they go to see those specific toys weekly. Getting out of the house in general is helpful for one's sanity. 

As far as housework goes. Declutter and minimize possessions! Best thing I've done. I have yet to organize and strategically place everything, but I can totally see how that will only improve our lifestyle at home and cleanliness/tidiness. Ask for help. If you can afford even 1 hour of help a week, it would be worth it. Get into a routine and schedule. With good habits you can do such things as unloading the dishwasher in the few minutes that it takes to make your coffee. Don't be afraid to let your son watch a bit of TV. When he is older, give him chores and tasks to help! 

I agree with the other commenter, as well. You must discuss this with your husband. At the very least he should be respecting your desire to go to sleep earlier. I, personally, find it quite difficult to sleep without mine in the bed with me. Now, his computer is in our bedroom, so the lights and sounds from gaming make it challenging to sleep.

Equality cannot be redistributive only when you want to when Title IX is a redistributive piece of legislation that it is based on.

character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love
for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed
Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life
Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I
really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the

well as female without any kind of discrimination on any ground. Also,
negative values are negative for everyone.. Irrespective of men and women.",0

3277,3278,"MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.

Look, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.

Especially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.

If you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.

Mysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.

Now more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.

Keep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.

What have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.

Dont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.

Take her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.

Talk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.

Keep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.

A healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.

Keep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.

Dont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.

Reframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.

Cool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.

A grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.

When is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .

How you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.

I use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.

You are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.

If you aint gaming, you aint fucking.

Be safe.

It's not a one size fits all but they do have an impact. At least, this is my understanding. The major differences come into play at the extremes of the deviation with some being more prominent than others. For example, interest in things vs people.

I'd agree that the perception of difference is greater than the differences themselves but your main argument is a bit of a Strawman against Feminists and MRAs to be honest. Feminism thinks the differences are small but socialisation makes men more violent on average (to use an example) and MRAs think socialisation and biology have an impact on behaviours but also that the negative traits of men are over reported and negative traits in women are under reported (and vice versa with positive traits). Your argument doesn't really tackle either of these.",0

I dont know if you saw my comment on your last post about checking out hbomberguy, but I seriously think some of his videos addressing antifeminism can help you. My first boyfriend was a misogynist, although I was too nave to see it at the time, and his belief in false statistics and social issues really affected the way he treated me and other women in ways I dont think even he realized at the time. Antifeminist/incel/redpill ideology is harmful for both women AND men, as Im sure youve experienced first hand when it comes to potential feelings of self-loathing or anger. Deconstructing some of the things you believe because of your time in these communities will really help you in the long run, I think.

form, not a documentary.. an art form could be of anything, any fucking
thing.. if society has i spit on your grave kind of movies, this kabir singh
is not even a speck in front of that, being said that, there are real rapists
all around in this country, in the garb of doctors, bosses, rickshaw drivers
etc, so every doctor doesn 't become a rapist, similarly if theres a character
of doctor played by the actor, then its his personal personality, it doesn't
have to do with heroism or patriotism or feminist or misogyny or anything!! a
character (not hero, which is low grade though of indian people that films
have a hero) a protagonist is does not mean a hero.. thats a childish
consideration , heroes are in marvel or either soldiers. these films only has
actors!! so an actor can be of any fucking kind, a drug addict, a womanizer, a
smoker a boxer a playboy.. any fucking thing.. there is no any thumb rule that
the protagonist has to be only the rahul or raj from ddlj, by the way raj was
a womanizer too! but that didn't bother these low life bitches.. and if they
say films promote misogyny, and preaches bad stuff and people become like
that, then god save the world from these dumb bitches and rajeev masand... in
short a character , an art can be anything, if a character is anti women,
thats his personality, women cannot change anyone's personality in the name of
misogyny, fuck off... and go back to school**",1

Starving people, killing people, propaganda, censorship, cult of personality, eliminating classes, creating a rich elite that is devoted to the party only, no opposition, collectivisation, Godlike strict rules (you can not pass a red light as pedestrian otherwise -good citizen score, wtf?), the ""new man"", dictatorship, etc
All of those were present or are present in China.

Extra: I am aware that some things are present in republics also but too few. If you are a fan of a dictatorial, strict, severe regime, by all means, go and live in China but do not run their propaganda agenda. 
I preffer to live in a roman republic( most democracies are based on the roman republic model) than a communist system even tho I preffer the greek republican model. Of course, ancient.

2. Kinda hard to believe that there are drones flying in USA to monitor you or NSA archieving literally all text messages and listening to all your phone calls. As I said, I am european and I do not know why you bought the USA drobe, NSA, gov stuff on table. This subject outclasses me. But again, kinda hard to see USA doing it, it would result in a more responsable society I imagine.

3. China is doing better economically, yea, in some areas facing starvation, poverty and other stuff like that. If it is as you say, would you also add the argument that Germany under A.H. was an economical power also?

4. Ok, I see why you bought women into discussion, you made a point. Well, communism exists in countries like Cuba, China, N Koreea, Vietnam, not sure about Venez and all of them are crap holes, except China that is doing better because they liberalised their economy. That's not an argument why commie is good and it works.

5. The GHO is a buch of clowns that run things on paper and not in reality. Examples: spanish flu, ebola, Covid 19, etc. They are kinda useless in my personal oppinion.

I am waiting for your counter arguments and also, can you provide me the links that state your theory that US soldiers planted the virus in Wuhan? I would like to read it.
